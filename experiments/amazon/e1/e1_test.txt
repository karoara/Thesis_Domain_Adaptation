0	i bought this watch for my husband but did n't take the time to read the description carefully so it 's my fault i had to send it back he is in the army and leaving soon for iraq i thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift unfortunately it does not work if you 're more than 2 000 miles from colorado if you are not going to leave the continental united states i suppose it would be a good watch	17

0	these earrings were very uncomfortable i'm not sure if it 's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle more like an angled bar than a round post i do n't have particularly sensitive ears although i generally do n't wear large or heavy jewelry either these earrings are on their way back to amazon i also was n't thrilled to see how much the price has varied when i ordered 4 6 07 they were 34 99 some reviewers bought them for less yet the current price seems to be even more caveat emptor	17
0	these earrings are very pretty but the post is way too thick they killed my ears and i had to return them i would guess the post is at least 2 5 times as thick as a normal post and my ears did not like it ! ! !	17
0	i was very disappointed in these earrings they were only about the size of a nickel and for 50 i expected them to be as large as earrings i have found from several other merchants for the same price if you are looking for average size hoops say the size of a quarter these are not the earrings for you i can only imagine how tiny the 30 pair is	17
0	my 5 year old daughter was thrilled with her locket it is really beautiful we were both quite disappointed however when the locket itself broke the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off she is a normal kid but was not overly rough with the necklace it is currently at the jeweler 's to be fixed	17
0	we bought this locket for my daughter and had it personalized with her initials on one side and the year on the other this is such a small locket that it will be very hard to put a picture in it also the locket is very very hard to open the top of the heart was n't closed all the way so the locket kept falling off the chain we had to have it fixed now it stays together my daughter loves it and wears it every day but i would have bought a different locket if i had realized how small this is and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn	17
0	the locket on this cable chain is so tiny you will not be able to put a picture in it after opening the box and being completely disappointed i opened the locket to see how it worked it would not close properly after opening the quality of this necklace is not good do not waste your money	17
0	these were nice earings which i received as a gift off my wish list but after i wore them about 3 or 4 times one of them fell out and is now lost the post does not stay in place very well i am frustrated because i put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an innovative clasp which avoids lost earings but they did not work well for me by the way after i first wrote this review i called amazon to complain they sent me another pair right away at no charge this suggests to me that others have complained in the past i appreciate that they were so responive	17
0	i ordered this watch and i got a woman 's watch the model number was the same i do n't know if there was a mix up but what i got was definitely not a men 's watch luckily amazon has a great return policy	17
0	this is way too small for a men 's watch both the face and the band the band would n't even go around my wrist i think this must be a women 's watch mislabled nice looking but i sure ca n't use it i'm going to have to return it	17
0	i bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews i thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches rather than paying 10 each time to have a professional do it i was so disappointed in this tool the link remover only pushes the pins out halfway you are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way as you can imagine this is not easy my husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out knowing what i know now i would definitely have invested in a different link remover	17
0	the product pretty much snapped in half while i was trying to remove two links from one watch the other one i tried before this one did n't fit in the adjustment piece at all so with that said do not buy this product at all it 's very poorly made and terribly annoying to use instructions are very unclear i ended up throwing it away and going to a watch shop to get it fixed	17
0	i had loved it at first but i am one to leave a necklace on forever it started to get all kinked up and i could n't figure out how to straighten it out but the company did offer me a discount on a different chain even though it was past their 30 day policy nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it	17
0	this ring had such great ratings after visiting it often i finally bought it as a gift when i saw it in person i was not impressed it does look like the picture but it also looks cheap i do realize it costs cheap i just was n't impressed it did arrive very quickly though	17
0	this was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it the only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened not worth the price	17
0	i bought this watch for a gift overall the watch is nice but it does n't work properly we will have to send it to fossil for repair	17
0	for 10 these were too good to pass up first noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem the earring is not all one piece first time i wore them lost one because the back slipped off though they were n't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out this is the second pair i bought first set was fine seems like the quality of construction may be slipping \( or a different supplier \? \)	17
0	though the design is cool the quality of this pendant is poor they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper they look like toys ! i also bought the earrings set with the same design and i'm so disappointed with both \( only the packaging is of good quality in this product i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design	17
0	though evenly matched the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these are n't apparent if you are wearing them about the quality you 'd expect from mervyn 's or sears on sale not terrible but not great	17
0	the color of the actually received ear rings was quite light a darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive since that showed a much darker colored amethyst i wo n't buy jewelry from amazon again when it comes to a colored stone hsn depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products	17
0	after about 3 weeks of wearing the necklace the cord came loose from the metal fasteners the glue used to keep the cord from unraveling was comepletely useless and the cord became unwound the cord looks very nice but the quality is terrible	17
0	it 's does n't look like as it appears in the photos i bought it to gift my husband and i wz very disappointed ! ! i returned it back !	17
0	there two major problems with this watch one auto atomic setting do not work as described in manual second unable to even set time using good old fashion manual way returned to casio for repair hope they get it right	17
0	fair warning had i had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company 's watches i never would have bought one do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money the percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low	17
0	i was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for christmas however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented now i need to return them other than the dent they were cute even though they were only 25 00 there should be some quality control by the manufacturer	17
0	i love the actually pendent the time it got there was great but i really did n't like how they show the pendent on a chain because i bought it for the whole package \( chain included \) so when i got it i was shocked that it did n't included it so buyers beware this supplier does n't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra 15 30 even thou they adversities it in their ad	17
0	i purchased this watch for my granddaughter as her first watch however it never worked i do n't know if it had a dead battery or if it 's broken the cost to replace the battery will be nearly as much as i paid for the watch i will try to resolve the issue with amazon	17
0	the earrings are nice a great value at 30 however the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore the posts are not the typical size one might find in us stores the posts are more typical of earrings that i have purchased in central southern america in fact this is where the earrings were made i returned them	17
0	this ring does not look as pictured it arrived today \( almost 3 weeks after i ordered it \) and is extremely thin has tarnish marks and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places it looks like it came out of a vending machine and i'm obviously pretty disappointed i wo n't be buying anything from this vendor again	17
0	actually i only wore it 2 days to work i took it off at night and put it on in the mornings on the 3rd day i noticed the silver peeling off i tossed it i know it was inexpensive but that was down right cheap never again ! ! ! !	17
0	make sure you read the fine print ! this bracelet is silver toned not sterling silver the embossing is also not the greatest clear on the one side but hard to see the letters on the other	17
0	this watch looks good but the movement is terrible i got this watch as a christmas gift but the 24 hour register was synchronized to the hour hand i must warn you if you purchase this watch then do n't be suprised if it does n't work right it may look like a rolex but it does n't work like one	17
0	i bought two of these one for each of my boys for christmas one of the two watches never did keep time properly i even changed the battery an expensive fix that did not work	17
0	this item was a nice gift the stones were a little discolored but that 's what you get for only paying 100 for 1 4 carat earings online	17
0	one earring was damaged and instead of replacing it as i requested they fixed it i will not be using amazon to purchase jewelry anytime soon	17
0	i purchased two of these necklaces but the first one broke the second time i wore it good thing i purchased two	17
0	the clip holds the money but the credit card holder is a bit scary it just does n't work that well plus it is very heavy if you put 5 bills in there even without the credit cards this thing is like putting a brick in your pocket i would not recommend it	17
0	as title says there were kind of a water mark on the face of the watch maybe a leak from the solar panel \? i did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch no point paying shipping back and forth anyways the instructions were easy to understand buttons on the side a little bit hard to push blue led on red face looks bad because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see this watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust i am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail	17
0	this watch was a disappointment it has a huge dial but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny it 's also an extremely flashy watch the image on the web site makes it look classy not so additionally the watch is completely useless under low light conditions it neither fluoresces nor does it have a light up function returned it after a week got my money back	17
0	the product doesnt appear as is shown on the picture at all its not red and its too small to even imagine i knew it would appear bit smaller than on picture but this is beyond my imagination the chain can break any time ! ! ! and the stud ! ! ! ! ! ! ! gosh i cant even see it ! now i'm gonna check if its really gold or not ! ! dont buy this product ! save yourself the money	17
0	do n't buy this item i was cheated now i am gonna send it back its really waste of your money do n't go by the price i will never buy anything from this site	17
0	like the looks of the watch however it 's very noisy and the clasp tends to come apart after removing the watch the face can also be difficult to read in bright light \( reflection \)	17
0	nice looking but with very serious design and or manufacturing flaw after less than 2 month of use in office environment glass cracked without any impact whatsoever now i 'll have to find out if skagen 's customer service is any good for 70 watch i certainly expected better quality after reading other reviews for this models i realized that many other people had the same issue bottom line avoid ! !	17
0	these were the worst pair of earings i have ever seen they were yellow from a mile away amazon was very accomodating when i returned them but save yourself the hassle the price is too good to be true with these earings	17
0	the quality of the stones is horrendous there are significant inclusions which are visible with naked eye from as far away as 3 feet these diamons should have been turned into diamond dust not set into jewelery	17
0	these diamonds should n't be offered in this size for jewelry the imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for great price but you get what you pay for	17
0	i bought these for my young daughter i understood the basics of diamond ratings and was n't concerned with the inclusions they may have contained i expected low quality stones with some particles visable to the naked eye what i did n't expect was the cloudiness although these were n't yellow in color they were the absolute worst pair of diamonds i had ever seen there was no clarity just two milky looking stones these diamonds should have been grinded and used for diamond dust or chips only	17
0	i can see why they are priced so low i figured that they would look like the photo or something like it but the ones i received are very cloudy i guess you get what you are paying for as for the k clarity i have no idea what that is so i never thought they would look this bad	17
0	i like it but i do n't like box 's watch which obsolescence i hope my boy friend will love it	17
0	i purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband when he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both spanish and english and there does n't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other since there were limited instructions with the watch by the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund not happ	17
0	i returned the pearl earings they were of very poor quality the colors were not pretty and the shapes were not even	17
0	this watch does not work according to the manual i have tryed to get it to work about 75 times my wife has tryed about at least 25 30 times and i took it to a jewler and even he could not get it to work this watch is a piece of jun	17
0	great watch manual very bad all depends on how much time you have to invest it will take it because of sorry manual	17
0	as per the review i decided to buy the item i received it it was very thick and ugly looking it just looks good in the picture as mentioned by someone it has plastic back cover which makes it worse it also is very large and long so to remove the small braces cost more overall unhappy and returned to amazon with loss of money in shipping	17
0	daylight savings time in the us has changed these watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules while you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks twice a year it kind of defeats the whole purpose	17
0	bought this as a christmas gift for a cousin who is mentally handicapped thought i could program it and have him enjoy the ease of reading the hands and the glow in the dark feature however it is now january 18th and i still cannot program the watch frustrate	17
0	as a talisman it is good but the product metal it is made of is critical	17
0	it was larger than i expected from the images thicker too in my opinion it did n't look as classy as the picture made me believe i was very disappointed that the regular second hand was not in fact the large sweeping thin hand that 's actually only for the stop watch the regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle really with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which and the cheaper look of the watch in person i never actually put it on before sending it back	17
0	these were on my mom 's wishlist so i bought them they just arrived and i'm totally disappointed i 'd return them if it would n't cost me and i was n't so lazy they look pretty darn cheap for starters also they came in a little plastic zipper bag inside of a little pseudo velour bag with a price tag for 3 30 on it save your money it 's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen	17
0	the topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth 45 but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page the shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5 16 long the larger stone is about 3 16 wide and 1 4 high the small stone is about 3 32 wide essentially you get what you pay for	17
0	i 've purchased this watch a month ago and although it 's nice the battery died already very dissapointed	17
0	i bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch the v notched end was too thick to fit i used my pocket knife instead maybe there 's a knack to it but i did n't want to scratch my watch while practicing the pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small recessed auto set buttons for which a ball point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy but you probably have something around the house that would work just as well \( mini screwdriver the point of a phillips head	17
0	i was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is i do n't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not or if they were and i just did n't see or pay attention to them but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it 's meant for a very young child the necklace may be 18 but the pendant itself was so small not at all what i was looking for so i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece what i was really wanting was a larger heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult never have found one yet	17
0	these earings were ok quality but were really small they would be better suited for a child	17
0	i was bought this present for valentines day it 's pretty i do wear them for everyday us	17
0	the diamonds are waaayyy too small nothing like the picture sent it back	17
0	when i received the earrings i got very disappointed because they are very very small i had to sell them my wife never wanted to wear them	17
0	my order arrived quickly but upon first use the clasp broke on this necklace since it was n't an expensive item i joined the ends together with a small wire ring i already owned since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced perhaps with another faulty item as they say you get what you pay for !	17
0	i recieved it promptly but it did n't work i took it to walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler i did that buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right i 've read the manual over and over my sons did the same it looks nice but does n't work and its been very aggravating i would n't recommend it	17
0	i got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch after wearing invicta 's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist when i received it i noticed the small scratches all over the crystal nothing deep but they really pick up the glare atomic signal i am unable to get it to pick up one in memphis tn i think i should be in range and all my atomic clocks sync up fine i have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house still no good basically i spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight lesson learned	17
0	this looked great when it came but broke in only one day really poor craftmanship	17
0	i bought these for my mom she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment the entire earring is tiny the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver from not very far away at all they just look like a gray blob very hard to tell what shape not impressed i suggest you look for something else i will be returning these immediatel	17
0	here is an example of the deception of photos on the net the smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product ! ! we had to put them on our 9 month old grandaughter and even then they still appeared tiny on her baby ears ! ! rip off never buy jewlery from amazon again !	17
0	this item cost alot of money but is a piece of crap do n't expect to put alot of money in this because it wo n't hold it my clip broke after a week do n't buy this item you can find better ones for a lot less money	17
0	i have owned several timex ironman watches over the years loved 'em all i do n't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery or if it 's a flaw in the watch however when punching through the modes everything is really slow if i go to alarm i have to wait a few seconds for it to appear then wait a few more when i choose to modify it not quick an easy like my other ironmans great features though if it was n't for this annoying delay 5 stars easy so i do n't know to blame amazon or timex for this either way it is a problem that dropped the score for me	17
0	it might just be really bad luck but after three fossil watches \( 1 x blue 2 x titanium \) i 've never managed to make them last more than two years each they are really cool look great and the price is reasonable but this is the third time fossil lets me down and to get them repaired through the warranty is extremely painful this time i'm looking for another brand as i feel i'm wasting my money	17
0	i bought this watch as a christmas gift for my boyfriend after 2 weeks the round thing on top of the watch came off the seller says it has to be sent to repair and it will take 3 to 5 weeks to get back i am so embarassed of the poor quality gift i chose and ca n't belive they will not replace it with an apology their answer is just not acceptable but there is nothing else i can do but write this review i have two fossil watches myself and after the good reviews i read i was happy with the gift but now i am so disapointe	17
0	the link remover is too flimsy to work i ca n't even say it works poorly one of the two tweezers is missing the case is nice	17
0	i ordered and paid for the watch band adjusting sizing link removing tool kit in box because of the picture of the tool box and i receive a totally different equipment than what is on the picture please make the vendor send me the correct item i ordered	17
0	poor quality one of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times	17
0	this watch stinks crappy manual the band is so big it could fit around my leg and when i received it it didn't work now i have to pay extra to fix the band and to get it working so much for what i thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch i would 've given it no stars if i could don't make the same mistake i did avoid this watch	17
0	since the product was not received i cannot give a good review for this transactio	17
0	i work in a bank where every year each of the branches does a stupid secret santa thing around christmas time i bought this as a gift for the guy i got stuck with the thing comes in a nondescript box and looks like a paper clip if i had given this as a gift people would have thought i raided the supply closet at work for a present total garbage	17
0	i got the watches as party favors for my 10year old party guests but none of the kids or i have been able to reset it my daughter has been frustrated with it and says some of her friends she inquired from had the same issue with the watch the 2 little knobs ca n't be manipulated as indicated on the accompanying instruction sheet needless to say the watches are beautiful and attractive but if kids for whom they were made can not reset them and use them then the purpose is defeated the service was great but the product is unsatisfactory phyllisunsatisfied custome	17
0	i know these watches were inexpensive but 2 right out of the box were broken and others broke very easily the clock functions well but the straps fall apart easily	17
0	one screw is gone amazon did not help me to replace it therefore the key ring is not operational the screws are very problematic	17
0	i love the size \( small \) and quality of these earrings that were ordered for my 6 year old the website picture shows them as a blue and purple color when i got them they were pink and green even the replacements they sent were pink and green i have not been happy with their customer service on these and will not order jewelry again	17
0	i bought this for my daughter the display was dead when it arrived i took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery and the live battery let some display show but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used my daughter found a much cheaper watch at target with more features \( a stopwatch ! \) this one was n't even worth sending back	17
0	the image really looks much better than the actual product stones are quite brownish not red as one would expect of garnet i would n't recommend anyone purchase this	17
0	they ship really fast which is nice but ultimatly this item reminds me too much of something that would come out of a 25 cent machine it is a piece of crap and it looks a lot dinkier in real life then it does in the pictures plus the stone is not garnet it more so resembles the color brown like a turd	17
0	i bought this ring for my girlfriend and 2 months later it completely fell apart the bands on the ring actually broke apart and piece by piece the ring crumbled poor quality i am not sure if it relates the thin bands that construct the puzzle ring or the fragile nature of the metal i wish i had my 25 bucks back	17
0	i bought this ring for my fiance since i have one and it 's a terrible ring we got it apart and then have not been able to get it back together it 's been over a month now we went online to get the directions that did n't help either plus the ring is so cheap it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape it is cheap and completely useless	17
0	someone please help me ! ! i have tried all the online help videos and guides and such and i still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again ! please help	17
0	i did n't feel it was necessary to read the reviews before i purchased the watch this is disney and tinker bell ! the word flirt did n't bother me either because tinkerbell was a flirt wow after reading the full product description with hot and saucy on the wrist band i was shocked that this watch is under the children 's section i needed this for my grand daughter 's birthday like it was said before i could have given this five stars but hot and saucy for a young girl oh no	17
0	to much trouble to send back but arrived with a dead battery ended up getting another gift and still carry watch around in trunk to get a battery put in it watch looks nice but it would be nice if it worked	17
0	having read the other reviews i expected something small but decent the particular pair i received had two defects 1 one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2 one of the stones had a very large visible black inclusion near the top it was visible to my naked eye \( i do n't have a jeweler 's loupe \) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts maybe i just got a bad pair but given those two problems and the small size of the stones i sent them back and did not try again	17
0	the gold balls came off their posts four weeks after use i would not recommend	17
0	i bought these for my wife for christmas 2005 by august 2006 one of them fell apart the gold loop is attached to the white gold loop by a very tiny and fragile weld which broke it was not due to any abnormally rough handling it would have cost 50 00 to have repaired now they 're throw aways	17
0	earings are too big no way of knowing they were as big as they are nothing i will wear	17
0	got the watch friday in the mail it looks cool and nice and teh band is shiny the number lines glow nicely in the dark i willoberserve the watch and come back in a month to say my opinions	17
0	looked good on me this watch but i found out just in time that this did not carry seiko's regular two or three year warranty since it is a grey market watch having read the many complaints about this seiko monster i decided i needed a warranty so for this simple reason i had to return it to amazon right away and am in the process of exchnaging it with another brand that does have warranty	17
0	when i first got this watch i was thrilled it has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination the problem started when i went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists the guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing at the time i thought he was just po 'd because i didnt buy the watch at the store as soon as i was home though the bracelet fell apart what a piece of junk ! i regret buying this watch and i advise against it	17
0	very disappointed in the watch and amazon the day date did not work on delivery but i was unaware of it until the end of february when i tried to manually change the date i found that it was broken at that time about a week after i received the watch the day date did change automatically each night amazon refused t orepalce it because i had the band adjusted seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3 4 weeks ! had i purchased it from a reputable local store i could have exchanged it for a new watch	17
0	seiko has produced a loser of a watch i really liked the design and seiko reputation of building a tough watch i have purchased seiko divers in the past with no problems i didn t know these watches were made in singapore maybe this is why my monster doesn t work who knows toke to authurized dealer for repair he wanted 175 dont buy seiko	17
0	i purchased this pair of earrings for my 5 year old granddaughter to wear as the flower girl in my niece 's wedding when the purchase arrived they were too small for my granddaughter therefore i had to return them	17
0	i orginally purchased this for myself when it was 10 as soon as i received it i went to put it on and it broke right away i was very disappointed so my boyfriend purchased another one for me for 10 i went to put that one on and it broke as well i was never able to wear the necklace even once i do not recommend this product to anyone ! ! ! ! !	17
0	it turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife 's ears i assume that the stems must not be white gold \? other than that they are as expected not perfect but not bad for the price	17
0	okay i may be picky but these earrings are just too thin ! i get the idea of delicate sparkly things but these do n't look so much delicate as they do insubstantial they are pretty and sparkly but the crystal looks like all i could afford was a thin slice the picture also makes the crystals appear blue ish but mine are more of a yellow ish tint not what i expected	17
0	the earrings looked so pretty in the picture in real life they look cheap they look like plastic not like crystal very disappointed	17
0	i read all these nice reviews and had a good impression of these earrings i should never have bought these ! ! they look nothing like the picture if you get these earrings you will be setting yourself up to be disappointed they look cheap and tacky like something you pay 25 cents for out of a gum ball machine	17
0	recieved my orange monster last september i have worn it every day i like the look and design of this watch but unfortunatly this watch does not keep very accurate time often losing about five minutes a week i have friends who also own the black monster and anonther orange monster and they have the same complaint if i was to buy another watch i would not buy this seiko again	17
0	the heart on the bracelet came off after the second day of wear i do not recommend the product but the delivery and service were done well	17
0	this thing is miniscule it barely fits on my \( petite \) seven year old 's neck although the size is mentioned in the description the picture is misleading the pendant itself is smaller than the image on the screen and i consider that borderline false advertising i should have been a more aware buyer so this review is n't to say the product is bad just be aware of how small it is my daughter could n't even find it in the bag when i gave it to her it was so small she thought i 'd bought her an empty bag	17
0	not what i expected the box was handmade the instructions were some other tool i have contacted seller and was not satisfied with response	17
0	you ca n't use this watch opener alone you need a vise to hold the watch the gromets that go into the opener that are supposed to fit into the watch back grooves do not stay in as soon as you turn it over they fall out i 've already lost two of them it 's a poorly made item and if it wold n't cost about as much to return it as keep it i would return it	17
0	so beware for regular size watch 's only will not open a marine star or anything bigger	17
0	it is constructed nicely however i could not open any of my watches with the pegs kept falling out of it hard to work with	17
0	loved how quiet it runs have one double the price and twice the noise ! only one problem the bottom turn table stopped within the first week ! ! yet the top turn table kept working contacted amazon and they secured a return only problem cost 11 00 to return seems the quality control needs improving	17
0	i bought this winder for my husband because of the price but it is so loud ! ! ! ! we had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom i would n't recommend this i guess sometimes you get what you pay for	17
0	i'm in the military it hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas it 's always been easy to order from amazon as always i never had any problems the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear the post broke off from the ball earring i only had them for two weeks	17
0	earrings were very lightweight hollow and the hoops were very thin not good quality i could have done better at walmart i expected a lot better from amazon com especially for 50	17

0	i saw this cute photo and bought it for my girlfriend when i got it it was the most horrible one	17
0	this pendant is on the cheap looking side but you get what you pay for i guess	17
0	i liked the watch i had to send the first one back because the date would never change i got the second one a month ago and have n't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash nice looking watch too bad i have to carry it around in my pocket now	17
0	big plus was the large digits on display i'm short sighted and run without my specs so i needed that the feel of the watch is nice however one big problem with it was that moving my wrist around kept poking the buttons and changing the display without warning \( maybe because i have big wrists \) bigger problem yet it took all of about 4 months for the plastic strap to break	17
0	this pendant looks great in the picture but when i received it it looks like yellow glass does n't look like a crystal at all i'm very dissapointed	17
0	there are n't any colors in this pendant just a ugly topaz which ruins the pendant same happened with heart i ordered from this seller normal swarovski crystals do not have a topaz covering the beauty of the crystals sorry i wasted my money should have bought from swarovski site	17
0	i bought a couple of pair of these for my wife for everyday ear rings the tiny stone fell out before she could wear one pair the earring is so small it makes it difficult to get on do not buy these	17

0	come on ! i thought they had erroneously mailed out czs ! these earrings dont have even the faintest tinge of blue in them ! what a rip ! the sterling silver was nice and well constructed but i purchased these earrings on the strength of what i thought were the dazzling blue topaz stones quite a disappointment ! i had to buy an emergency back up christmas gift for my best friend	17
0	please read mr marcus c dunn 's review because i agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings in my case i bought it as one of the many small presents for my fiancee when i first received it today i was really liked the design of the earring but after closer examination i noticed that the blue stone was very light blue good quality earring for a young teenager \( 9 to 14 years old \) but not for the woman i'm going to spend the rest of my life with returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson jewelry has to been seen and bought with your own eyes and not through fancy photoshop website with touchup enhanced photos	17
0	the display fogged up within a week i got a replacement and it 's doing the same thing would not recommend this product	17
0	this watch did not last long in the water even though it said it was waterproof for 200 meters it lasted 2 weeks if you plan to purchase it for water look somewhere else	17
0	i loved my timex at first i have had it 6 months and have put 3 batteries in it i give up ! i guess timex no longer takes a licking and keeps on ticking i am going back to fossil brand	17
0	this was a present to myself for my birthday i thought i was purchasing a quality product two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working i took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again i sent it back for a refund and not very happy i have to pay a restock fee for a defective item i will be rethinking future purchases	17
0	these earrings look like pieces of glass not diamonds no sparkle at all i feel i wasted my money caveat emptor	17
0	i got these as a college grad gift and while i love to wear them because of the thought behind them and who they came from they have very large very visible flaws i know the color and clarity were posted on the website but the other reviews made me wonder if i got an exceptionally bad pair \? people wo n't notice anything without taking a good close up look though and like i said i still love to wear them despite the quality	17
0	i do n't know who 's running the show at amazon but thier packing is atrocious they packed this watch with only a single air bubble of course when i received it it fell out of its tin and was scratched be wary of buying anything from amazon in regards to precious jewelry watch was fine though so if you really want this item purchase it somewhere else	17
0	croton makes very superficial products they look good on the shelf but are very poorly constructed once you get them home they start to fall apart they have no customer service at all nobody answers the phone or returns email before buying a croton watch call their customer service you wo n't get through	17
0	this is great looking watch at a good price but very heavy i am unable to wear this watch with activities like golf and tennis	17
0	i ordered this necklace thinking that it would be small and dainty it is actually quite large and cheap looking i was really disappointe	17
0	it tarnished on the first day and broke on the third day it is in the trash where it belong	17
0	i am very disappointed with this ring it is very pretty but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together my husband and i have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had no luck now all i have is a pile of silver rings that i cannot wear if anyone knows how to put this back together please post how ! thanks	17
0	the diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits as a result the diamonds are dark in color and do n't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid i'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago i do not recommend purchasing from this company if you 're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye	17
0	most of the items were fine they were just given as gifts with 4 damaged i have tried to return without success i am disappointed that i am not able to return damaged or not functioning items i may think twice about ever doing this agai	17
0	the chain was much thicker than i expected and it 's pretty obvious that it is n't real silver but if you want some cheap metal bling this will do it	17
0	we never did figure out how to make them work the saddest thing was we gave them as gifts to our nephews boys and they could not use them very dissatisfied with this purchase	17
0	i purchased this as a gift for my daughter and was disapointed in the quality of the blue topaz they look dirty or something i went with the all blue topaz one that amazon sells and was quite impressed that for less money i ended up with a nicer necklace	17
0	i received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch unfortunately the crown would n't pull out \( to set the date time \) so i returned it immediately fortunately amazon 's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping \( either way \) for broken items i 'll probably try again with another invicta from amazon	17
0	these are nice amethyst earrings nice purple color however i'm returning them because they 're too big for my ears the basket setting makes them stick out too much the setting is not very pretty the gems are set very low into the basket	17
0	the watches looked very cheap could not gift it to friends	17
0	i have not yet been able to fasten these things while they are in my ears they are not useful to me at all	17
0	the watch came in a great looking case the face of the watch was attractive then oops could n't fasten it because there was no fastener it came with a return address slip for sending it back which is nice but i 'd rather get what i thought i ordered	17
0	these earrings have no blue in them ! the picture is extremely deceiving	17
0	the aquamarine earrings do not look at all like aquamarine which is supposed to be light blue they had no color so i ended up returning them	17
0	i loved these earrings and at the price i thought they 'd be great however when i got them i quickly discovered that the back for one of the pair was too loose to actually stay on the earring within two days the earring had fallen out and i have yet to find it there 15 down the drain	17
0	waveceptor doesnt work properly it doesnt get in sync with new daylight savings and you dont even have a knob to manually correct it the watch i bought is just of no use to me now i would have to return it to casio for repair	17
0	i bought this to change my watch battery tools broke after using it once worthless complete waste of money on this cheap toolkit	17
0	the packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale nice black leather case much nicer than the bracelet deserved however the bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap it is not rounded as pictured but flat like a dog tag \( only much smaller \) i'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but i would never wear it by itself i understand though that it is not an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for 925 silver at that price	17
0	product is not as pictured looks like a dimestore fake i had purchased this for one of my bridesmaids and now have to spend more money to buy her something else i would not give this to a 4 year old let alone a 34 year old i am very disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	17
0	i'm very disappointed in the watch we bought as the second hand broke off is there some way i can get a new one or get my back \? please let me know	17
0	beautiful color but very small in size i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the pictur	17
0	these watches sounded like a good deal given the original price i ordered two one for myself and one for my brother they arrived today and both could not be set that is the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out they were both stuck in the case so tight i broke a nail in the attempt and i agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless they go back tomorrow	17
0	i ordered this bracelet as a christmas gift for my best friend based on the reviews it seemed to be a really nice product at a decent price however upon receipt of the bracelet i was so disappointed in its quality that i felt the need to purchase another gift to give along with the bracelet	17
0	i was very disappointed in this purchase and eventually ended up returning it the actual product did not live up to my expectation while the cross was of average quality \( not great but ok \) the chain was very cheaply made it did not even have a clasp on it you had to pull it over your head to get it on the price of this item did not match the quality of the product by any means even though i was disappointed with the item i have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back no questions asked	17
0	i have purchased eight of these units over the past year two of the eight have stopped working altogether and this morning one of the turntables on a third unit now fails to revolve the seller replaced the first unit that failed and when i requested replacement of the second unit i was told that it has been replaced by a newer model with vertical stacking and more timing features they could not offer the new model to me in exchange but they did offer a 20 discount it arrived today and seems to be working well if you are considering purchasing any unit made by this manufacturer \( garnin \) consider it as suitable for short term use rather than long term usage	17
0	i guess you get what you pay for but i thought it would be a bit nicer than it was very cheap looking not well mad	17
0	not worth the even 15 cheap and unattrctive gave it to my ki	17
0	while the style of the necklace was nice the quality of the silver is poor very poor and not marked as being silver either which makes me wonder if its silver at al	17
0	i understood the necklace and bracelet to be a matched set when the pearls arrived the necklace was a different color and grade than the bracelet it was really too bad because the bracelet was really rather nice looking the neklace however was some kind of peach color and so full of flaws yeach	17
0	says it sets atomically to time in boulder co but it does n't amzaon return policy rips you off on return read the fine print buyer beware	17
0	this bracelet is actually really nice but too bad it is so cheaply made that mine broke in about 2 weeks it 's easily fixed all i need is to get new end clasps and attach them to the leather braid but i was hoping for a better made product	17
0	i found the pendant to be too large the for delicate chain it hangs from and the pendant is flat and thin i will be returning it	17
0	the watch winder is very quiet and inexpensive however the quality is suspect one side stopped rotating after a week you probably get what you pay for too much hassle and does not make economic sense to ship back and incur international shipping charges	17
0	you get what you pay for ! i bought this item last october and it is dead in february look elsewhere	17
0	the chain was very thin and fragile the locket itself stopped closing properly within 3 days i plan to send it back for a refund pretty but piece of junk	17
0	i never bought this item i do n't know why amazon asked me to review it i bought similar items looks good and works fin	17
0	bought this for our 20 year old son for x mas i was very disappointed with the quality of this 85 pendant and returned it the very next day the chain looked and felt like plastic my initial reaction when i took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine went to a christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for 28 that was 1 000 times better than this 85 one	17
0	i really thought this necklace looked good in the picture and then i recieved it today wow ! it is so light and the quality of the chain is terrible i have bought this for my boy friend for christmas and now im wondering whether to even give it to him it should cost 20 bucks maybe	17
0	this is the most ugly thing i 've ever seen in my life feels like plastic i hate it my boyfriend bought it for his friend he will probably be returning it way too expensive for the quality of this thing	17
0	i had this heart rate monitor for 7 days the first couple of days it worked fine then it just stopped transmitting i tried everything and it just did not work the watch itself was fine i ended up sending it back and paying the little bit extra for a polar	17
0	this bracelet is a lot thinner and lighter than i thought it would be i was expecting a chunkier tiffany style tag bracelet but it is smaller and more feminine not what i expected	17
0	i only paid 39 99 and it was still a rip off it says it 's 1 inch by 1 inch but it 's about the size of a dime ! ! ! so dissappointed sending it back	17

0	the ones i received would n't lock anbd were bent i need an address to return them and get a refund i do n't have the receipt	17
0	the picture provided is very disceaving this product could very well come packaged as a free prize in a box of lucky charms i was planning on giving this to my girlfriend as a gift but was far too ashamed stay away move onto a different product i will be returning asap	17
0	the picture and description is not at all what you get it is tiny looks cheap and i was ashamed of bieng taken of advantage of one expects better quality from amazon do not buy go to a reputable jewelr amazon should stick to selling books	17
0	the picture showed is about 3x magnification the diamonds are tiny and it looks very cheap i will be returning this necklace	17
0	i 've owned it for a few months the crystal scratches easily mine has a dozen or more serious scratches which makes the face hard to read not a good buy	17
0	for the price its not bad but as a watch you get what you pay for the band felt fake and the watch itself is too think for my taste i ended up returning the watc	17
0	i bought this for my grandson for christmas and when his mother was taking it out of the box the clasp broke and it 's not repairable apparently it 's attached to the box with staples and unless you have a staple pulled it 's too fragile to just pull from the holder	17
0	this necklace is like a strong circle of silver there was almostno bend to it at all and it was not fluid	17
0	very lousy quality faceplate fell off on arrival	17
0	when i got this it said 2 5 caret weight well they came and are 2 caret weight and are so small i will give them to granddaughter not worth sending back as it's too much bother to do ! ! what a rip off i went back to see if i read it wrong and it's still listed at 2 5 caret size !	17
0	i never recieved this watch and about 30 or so days later amazon refundedmy payment i don' understand why this supplier could not come up with such a common item but i got my money back so i am not upset this is why i try not to buy from an amazon seller preffering to buy directly form the amazon site	17
0	watch is great looking but there was no battery in it now i have to get it to a jewlers to buy a battery there was no indication of this in the ad or in the instructions	17
0	i was shocked when i received these earrings they are quite small more for a child than an adult all in all they are beautiful and my husband thought they were real ! the price is right	17
0	this was a total waste of money it 's a real cheapo like something out of a cracker jack box	17
0	i am still waiting to receive my item so i couldn't possibly rate something i don't have except to say that its taken way too long to receive	17
0	this watch is a good size pretty comfortable and nice looking for a sport watch but resetting time or date or figuring out how to turn off the alarm when you set it by mistake \( when you were trying to figure out how to reset the time and date \) is super frustrating the buttons are impossible i 've had it with mine and will buy another product	17
0	the watch is quite lightweight and comes with good features however i think it is very hard to use you have to hit the buttons just right and for the certain amount of times to change anything if you lose the directions you will never remember how to change it it took me over 6 months to change it i had many people try to alter it but it was to no prevail additionally the watch is not very water resistant i went swimming a couple of times and now i hardly see the time due to the water i would recommend paying more for a lot better watch for this was a waste of money !	17
0	i find it intresting that i am being asked to rate a product that was ordered 6 weeks ago and i still have not received or have been given a notice of shippment	17
0	this product is not worth the price by itself it 's fair at buy 1 get 4 free the time function works fine the compass on the other hand is virtually useless having gotten 5 watches all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions	17
0	i recently bought this casio automic solar powered watch and was very excited by the automatic time keeping feture it is agreat watch but does not have a timer built in which i need when working out fartlek runs and in between sets it has a uselesss feture of recording time of events which i am not sure why anyone would actually need this with out the data of what actually happpened during those 30 recorded events \? wish casio would put a timer in it guess i'll go back to a timex ironman later	17
0	i 've had three of these watches but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on its ridiculus b c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore triathlons however the interval counter is a great feature but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two	17
0	this is not a rosary it is just a necklace with a crucifix and medal attached a catholic rosary has 5 decades \( 1 our father 10 hail marys \) this has no spaces to designate the our father from the hail marys it also has 17 extra beads on the rope and 3 extra beads on the beginningjust after the crucifix	17
0	i 've had this watch for about 5 months now and the threaded crown or body stripped so the crown no longer locks in place i 've tried contacting citizen for waranty and they say it 's not covered citizen claims that i over tightened it or cross threaded it while screwing down so it will cost 50 100 to repair total joke ! i 'll never purchase a citizen watch again i 've always thought they were cheap to begin with this just confirms my thoughts	17
0	i really liked the watch as it looked in the picture but when i purchased it i realized that its way too shiny if you have a thin wrist then the watch looks really bulky besides the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north so you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time i am going to return this watch	17
0	when i received these earrings i was delighted they were just what i wanted however after wearing them for a few weeks one of them had a major discoloration on the back portion it was not normal tarnish which one might expect from sterling additionally i was experiencing extreme irritation which might suggest that they are not as sterling as stated with much disappointment i ended up throwing them away	17
0	this watch is very attractive however the clasp is not stable and it has fallen off my arm several times i rarely wear it as a result and am always surprised it 's still there when i do with a more stable clasp this would be a 4 star watch but this problem is severe enough that it makes the watch worthless to me \( hence 1 star \)	17
0	i loved the watch when i first received it i wore it two or three times then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up i tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so i stopped wearing it	17
0	ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what i received was worse than expected in part because amazon sent the wrong item spoke with customer service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first however the same wrong item was again sent the problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket one even cheesier than the product listed i contacted customer service regarding the replacement they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct eventually both lockets have been returned there did n't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket i wound up ordering a completely different design from another vendor	17
0	i agree that this is a beautiful product however i returned these earrings not long ago the reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring i tried to wear them but the half arrow was too big and i could n't get them through my earlopes	17
0	some spot was off on the white paint on the guess women 's white chronograph was off when i got it i did n't like that at all	17
0	the quality is not so good i also got a smaller carat than i bought i contacted the seller for a return but they are not cooperative and did not provide information on how to return the item looks like i will dispute the charge on my credit card beware	17
0	the first day i wore this ring one of the stones fell out the day it fell out i was typing on the computer did not even know it came out till later did not find the stone would not recomend this ring	17
0	which makes the wrench completely useless i 'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits also the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made do not buy this product	17
0	the instructions that you do get are wrong the items i get and the ones listed are totally different it does n't tell you how to use each of the tools some of the tools i'm still puzzled in what to do with it the soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet does n't look too soft too me !	17
0	extremely poor quality tools complete waste of money for this price barely worth 10	17
0	the kit looks professinal it would be nice if they would include instructions i have no idea what each tool is for and how to use them it is not designed for a homeowner would not recommend it	17
0	the kit is a batch of tools that are mostly not defined with little to no instruction most pieces are of junk quality and break after one or two uses if they last that long clearly not worth the price	17
0	i recently ordered this item and was disappointed the chain is of poor cheap quality which makes the necklace look tacky i 've bought necklaces in the same price range of much better quality i will be returning this item along with the other items i ordered from nvie also of cheap quality	17
0	i 've bought a lot from amazon over the years this was the first watch though i 've bought and owned several seiko watches this is probably the worst experience that i 've ever had with amazon and seiko too ! the watch came with a box that looked water damaged the watch itself has a broken clasp it looks beautiful but i bought it as a gift when she opened it the clasp refused to lock its never gone far enough to have the time set or even being tried on amazon actually tried to sleeze out of it by telling me to follow the waranty pocedures how long does she have to wait for her birthday gift \? the warranty process could take weeks	17
0	i work in nyc and live on long island and the watch would never connect the whole point of th watch was that it did that but it never did i returned right away	17
0	i am rather picky but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage but also the name they were not what i was expecting when they arrived they are okay but not nearly what i thought they would be they are not very sea opal ish they look too glassy and transparent the silver is also okay but could be better i would not recommend	17
0	this set of earrings was only 10 and the delivery from silver insanity was fast but false advertising really pisses me off they do not look nearly as nice as the picture and in fact the glass part of the earring is plastic and it even has bubbles in it it 's ugly the other earrings that i bought from them also do not look much like their photos	17
0	battery died within a month i had already gotten rid of the packaging	17
0	not as they appear ! march 8 2007reviewer rappster \( denver co \) see all my reviewsi ordered these earrings on a 'gold box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive they were such a disappointment i returned them the next day i did not expect the diamonds to be huge based on their cttw but the earrings themselves are miniscule ! they look like they were made for children i tried on one earring and could n't even see the earring in my ear much less tell there were any diamonds it looked like i did n't even have an earring on !	17
0	i just received this locket which was intended to be a gift for my niece for x mas and had to decline on giving it to her when i received it i actually thought amazon forgot to put it in the bag it came in i shook the bag felt for the necklace and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant it 's so small i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself i was very disappointed other then the size and over priced tag i thought it was cute but i will be returning it sorry	17
0	this watch died \( battery \? \) one year after i bought it i like the watch it fits well and i'm able to swim in the pool and ocean with it but i ca n't find a place to repair it here on maui it has a 3 year warranty but i 'd have to mail it in after the battery is changed it needs to be pressure tested what a hassle	17
0	i had a watch like this from pulsar years ago and it worked well this one i am returning to amazon because it ca n't keep time and the calender keeps resetting to jan 1 it was made in china so what can i expect i am deeply disappointed in this product no more pulsars for m	17
0	i was hoping for a little bit higher quality but you get what you pay for i gues	17
0	i bought a nike triax c5 heart rate monitor watch a year ago the strap is already falling apart near the bezel the watch has a 2 yr warranty but do not cover the strap or the crystal even if the problem is poor workmanship	17
0	i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service \( communication and such \) have been very good i purchased this bracelet a few months ago and \( a few days ago \) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer i was taking it off and it snapped in the middle once you could see the insides it was obviously not pure sterling silver as the materials portion indicates i will be returning this item for a new one \( already gave my girl a matching one \) and may not even wear it at all very disappointing	17
0	although this product is pretty to look at one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands i do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe	17
0	the good news is the watch 's case is quite nice now the could be improved points it 's sized weird it 's a lot larger than you think add to that it 's bracelet is rather small so now that i removed a single link i can barely get it over my average sized wrist and once it 's on it 's still too loose weird but true frankly it 's good looking but i do n't think i 'll get another one	17
0	i really liked the way this cross and chain looked unfortunately i only got to enjoy it for about a week before the flimsy chain broke and i lost the whole thing	17
0	i ordered a swarovsky crystal pendant which i thought was clear like one i had purchased once on a visit to a swarovsky factory the one i received is clear but not like the first one it is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one i was disappointed	17
0	heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture there 's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal swarovski crystal in other words no colors shine at all same thing in on other sites for like 1 speedy delivery was the only positive	17
0	the pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design it does not go with the center design i think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either	17
0	the first watch i received did not work at all the second watch runs fast i really thought seiko made a better product maybe it really is n't a seiko	17
0	the pic online is not a true representation these are more like baby cuffs was so embarassed to give as a xmas gift	17
0	i bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off i felt like the biggest loser when i contacted amazon they said that because it was over 2 months that i had bought the earrings i could n't return them what a rip off these earrings do n't even deserve 1 star	17
0	i chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo they felt quite flimsy when i got them i do like a lightweight earring but not a flimsy one the studs on these are not attached as firmly as i would like one has already come off they are however very pretty the quality was just not what i expected	17
0	these earrings looked great and i really liked them but in less than a month the posts broke completely off and the earrings are now completely useless	17
0	band deteriorates rapidly \( 4 months \) design makes it exceptonally dificult to replace withouttedious modification see other reviewactual picture of band shows how replacemnt band fails to follow curve of watch body real dud monthly cost of ownership makes it as costly as a role	17
0	i bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price that is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch but i guess you get what you pay for	17
0	i recived the watch and it is fine however i want to complain above amazon 's way to pack purchases amazon pack a tiny watch box in a huge box then i have to pay lots of money paying a mail forwarder because to this policy i use a mail forwarder from miami to caracas \( venezuela \) and i spread 19 instead 5 because box size and i recived a huge box full of air bags this situation is not the first time to happend and i hope amazon compense me in any way	17
0	the watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice unique design unfortunately i have had terrible issues with the pins between the links there are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and i have to shimmy them back in all day long i tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it did n't last this is the kind of issue i would expect from an inferior watch perhaps one well under 100 bucks	17
0	earrings are pretty but look cheap and very flimsy i know they are supposed to be delicate but they are not what they appear to be from the picture	17
0	wife liked them so much she asked me to buy her a set of black ones she was also happy that they had 14k gold posts she loved the quality	17
0	this watch is lightweight and elegant in appearance but the clasp loosened repeatedly in ordinary wear i returned the item for credit	17
0	this is a great watch to wear casually or formally it works very well easy to read and is stunningly elegant in its design amazon was a fantastic place to get it the best price and the shipping was quick	17
0	these earings are the worst ! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color ! on was grey and one was black ! i dont recommend this	17
0	the earrings are very pretty but the posts arrived bent the material for the post is too soft	17
0	this is a beautiful watch but just a word of warning it is big ! i actually returned it for a smaller one the watch face is 30mm which is quite a bit larger than most women 's watches the face was almost the size of my husband 's watch if you like big watches then you will love this one it is beautiful but if you want a normal size watch i would reccommend that you keep on shopping	17
0	though the design is cool the quality of this earrings set is poor they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper i also bought the pendant with the same design and i'm so disappointed with both \( i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design	17
0	this locket was dime sized much smaller than i had anticipated it was also very plain and looked cheap the mother of pearl locket was much better	17
0	i liked these earrings when i got them they were smaller than i hoped but would wear them anyway i lost one earring the first time i wore it ! ! ! ! ! i am so bummed ! so if you get them put a back on the wire part of the earring	17
0	the closure for the earings was not secure as a result everytime anything brushed against your ear the closure came undone and within two weeks i lost one earing this type of closure is not practicle for anyone who is remotely active	17
0	i bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch for swimming and running unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming is unbelievably bulky and has this strange time setting system which only works in the usa and europe \( i live in australia \) in the end i gave it to a relative in the usa	17
0	i think the picture is better than the real thing the gems are actually pretty decent they are a good size and have a hint of color however the setting is so deep and so bulky that when the earrings are on you ca n't see the sparkle of the stones if the setting was daintier and the stones had more color these would look great but as they are the earrings look like blobs not tanzanite	17
0	i have had this watch for about 4 months if you do n't have a job operating a jack hammer it will probably run itself down i am very disappointed in the watch it was not cheap i paid about 200 for it and i expected better i am one of those people that never take my watch off and it still winds down and stops i made a big deal about this watch with my wife and now i get a lot of grief when i complain about it it is sturdy having hit the wall several times	17
0	the description states that it holds large watches but they hit the glass when the top is closed especially casio 's larger g shocks the lock did not work but i do n't care about that the beige material on the inside and pillows peels off ! i will not purchase another case of this brand	17
0	this watch was of such poor quality that the second hand fell off by the third day of use the cost of shipping to claim a defect under warranty was more than the initial cost of the watch a total disappointment and waste of time and money do n't buy this watch	17
0	clip is uneasy to use arrows fell off after my first run would never by anything from this manufacturer again	17
1	elegant yet tough this particular casio has a metal bracelet and is extremely comfortable to wear the display is sharp clear and very easy to read i only wish it had a thermometer the watch is big and looks very macho on your wrist	17
1	i wear this watch every day and i usually work outside i am very pleased with the features and the durability it seemed daunting to work the features at forst but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy i have only two complaints one is that the metal band has developed a slight squeak when i move my wrist sometimes the tin man needs oil the second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night the watch does not always get the time signal from ft collins i have gone as long as several days without getting it but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all i am ok with the spotty reception	17
1	i love this watch it has radio controlled time so it gives you exact time automatically easy to read numerials watch is attactive the only down side is that it is a little bit on the heavy side	17
1	this watch just absolutely filled the wish for my 4 year old grandchild ! she is unable to tell time yet but she wanted a princess watch to help her learn and she was thrilled when she received it my daughter told me it was pretty and soft looking i insisted that the watch be one with hands not digital so we all were happy and satisfied ! ina lan	17
1	comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces a quality time piece band has a felt backing for extra comfort the smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures	17
1	great deal and gift if you want something different and at a good price	17
1	comes in nice display box with cushioned spaces a quality time piece band has a felt backing for extra comfort the smaller items are buttons that are afixed with tie tack type closures	17
1	i love knowing the exact time \( even if my mom thinks i am crazy \) and it works like a clock ! i never have issues with the updates \( in illinois \) but i do have a few minor issues the watch is too thick \( 5 8 inch \) the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human the buttons are hard to press and the manual is too small and hard to read still if i had a choice between this watch or my borhter 's rolex i will take his rolex and exchange it for 40 casios thank you casio	17
1	i live in eastern pennsylvania about 1600 1700 miles away from the atomic time signal station and this watch syncs fine right on my bureau 4 feet from a window and in a watch case when i received the watch the battery indicator was on medium after about 30 minutes or less on a sunny windowsill it achieved full charge i'm quite pleased with it	17
1	i bought two of these for my twin two year old nephews who liked my watch they 're too young to tell time but love the watches and asked to put them on in the mornings while i was visiting it has great features to help kids learn how to tell time and the watch is small enough for tiny wrists but with a face big enough for learning	17
1	i returned these because they were too large for me to be fair to zina they were as described and i was n't sure they would work the only reason i'm not rating them a 5 is that having returned them i do n't know how long the clasp would work i kept gold small hoops i bought at same time very happy with them zina 's product descriptions are exceptionally good	17
1	i love the look and function of this watch but guys if you have any hair on your wrists be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band i 've had 3 other fossil watches and never had this problem i think fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one ouch !	17
1	i got this watch one week ago its very good looking watch its 85 but looks like 150 watch all of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily it upper dial \( having number 05 15 25 etc \) rotates clock wise this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving its bit heavy but now i am used to it i would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist	17
1	the earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find my daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one but that is no bash on the earrings the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment i would definitely buy them again	17
1	i got these today and was so shocked when they arrived wow these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars i am more than pleased do n't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about i am floored at the price and the quality at the same time with free shipping these are a must great gift idea and everyday earrings amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and i'm in hawaii they also came beautifully packaged i'm in love with them do n't let these sell out	17
1	these were perfect the girl liked them they 're the perfect size not very expensive great gift	17
1	i sent these for my cousin \( who has everything ! \) on her 16th birthday when i saw them later they were smaller than i expected but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated they are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold i would recommend these	17
1	i have shopped with this company before and have never been disappointed fast shipping and delivery reasonably priced and always what you expected	17
1	this invicta 2699 watch it 's a nice watch the case of stainless steel polished looks very well solid with transparent case back although there is nothing exceptional to look at dial of mother of pearl clear and clean with not too many words or other dials on it looks elegant the roman numbers are very good for that dial the hands are big enough to be seen even in poor light conditions the movement is a miyota automatic with 21 jewels works fine for the price it has poor power reserve so if you do not use it for 24 hours it will stop nothing to worry about	17
1	exactly what i wanted at a great price	17
1	these have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings they look substantial when worn but they are lightweight and comfortable they go well with either silver or white gold necklaces they are shiny and have a classic appearance plus the snap bar locks them securely in place buy them and you wo n't be sorry ! they also make a great gift item	17
1	i did n't expect the earrings to be so beautiful and they 're really easy to wea	17
1	silver insanity continues to produce gorgeous items of celtic jewellery the drop hook earrings come with nice size faceted oval synthetic amethyst stones very light weight looks like you would pay 4 5 times the price silver insanity just delivers time after time	17
1	quality of leather looks nice i can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off it 's metal squeazed to leather and that 's what i expected you just have to keep an eye on it and do n't sleep or shower in it it looks nice	17
1	these are so beautiful picture does not do them justice gorgeous celtic knot design	17
1	these earrings are very good quality sent to me quickly and in a jewelry bag a very nice gift	17
1	i was getting worried if it would arrive before my girlfriend went home for the holidays then as promised it arrived today last day in the estimated delivery window hey its christmas i understand shipping sucks this time of year but i still would have been angry if it was late ok item itself looks great i love the chain that came with it the box looks a little to cheesy on the outside to be romantic but the wrapping was high class enough to make up for the box im sure my girlfriend will love this it will go great with her tattoo	17
1	this necklace is well made very lovely i am very pleased with the quality	17
1	this is a great watch for a woman ! i ca n't see it fitting a man and the watch face is too small for a man i ordered it for my sister who has a large wrist and it is perfect for her	17
1	my watch band was wider than the tool allowed so i used a milling machine to let it accept 1 8 more ad should have stated how wide a band would work in this device otherwise worked well	17
1	tool works pretty well product slightly different than picture not quite as good of quality as pictured worked on several brands of watch bands seller was prompt	17
1	good product for a good price this is an item u ca n't do without would buy from vendor again	17
1	i got it since two month ago and it looks cool i like it	17
1	it is good and nice design but it is little bit heavy	17
1	my husband had seen this watch advertised in a magazine and fell in love with it and had to have it i searched at tommy stores large department stores and was not able to find it anywhere except amazon com the watch arrived as promised and my husband loves the watch	17
1	i need this bracelet for someone heading for the military she would love it very much	17
1	this quote became my all time favorite the first time i read it i was so delighted to find it on a piece of jewelry ! i had it on my quot wish list quot for over a year this year my husband finally took the hint and bought it for me ! it 's a beautiful piece is very comfortable and is made of quality silver i highly recommend it for anyone who finds herself needing a boost of self reliance throughout the day	17
1	i have a disabled child and i got this as a gift from my husband and children i look at it and i feel so greatful for the family i have	17
1	these were slightly smaller than i had hoped but they 're pretty and they do the job	17
1	excellent quality the post is smooth and does not abrade the ear as some inexpensive earrings do the ball is smooth and shiny with no ripples pits or other defects i am very happy with this purchase	17
1	the item has arrived in perfect timing the earrings are good quality but not the best one	17
1	i purchased these at 16 in december 2006 they are currently running for 15 which is so worth it for 14k white gold earrings at this price you should be thinking about next year 's christmas presents otherwise if you are looking for a treat for yourself you will not be disappointed the reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size the earring backs should be larger they are on the small side	17
1	gave these to my wife as part of a birthday gidt and she loves them she says they feel more comfortable than most stud type and they look great	17
1	these earrings are great they are the perfect size i would recommend these to anyone who likes a classic look	17
1	these earrings were a great value for the price ! they 're small and delicate enough to wear out but also look very polished for work i would recommend them to any and everyone	17
1	this is a great looking watch and i like that it is lightweight i took it to the jeweler to have a few links removed it 's just techie enough for a geek like me \( updates via satellite days of the week in several languages etc \) enjoy	17
1	this watch is a high quality item for low money you might think at first the color of the face is a little loud but you grow to like it and as most of you know if you have to grow to like something you like it for a longer time than something that just grabs you quickly it keeps perfect time at all times as it is updated with a signal from fort collins colorado every night i would definately reccommend this item brand for anyone looking for a watch	17
1	this is a great watch for my husband mike he has wanted a watch that he did n't have to worry about changing the time on all the time he travels often in his work i also has a nice lighted face which is easy for him to read getting older posses some vision problems so being able to read the time on your watch is a wonderful advantage he also likes that it is on atomic time and energy	17
1	product matches expectations no problems some other customers complained about how lightweight it is to me it seems like what you should expect from titanium \( after all that 's why they use it to make aircraft \) the predictions of it getting sprung \( losing its spring tension \) were more of a legitimate concern to me but i 've had it for a month or two and it seems fine it seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip which is to say maybe it eventually will or maybe it wo n't them 's the risks of life go for it	17
1	i purchased these earrings for my infant daughter since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a 3 month old 's ears this was the perfect solution as my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me these are small enough not to bother me the prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures but they are still very cute i also like the backs as they screw on to the posts and are nice and safe for baby 's head	17
1	i needed something to express how i felt in a way that few words would say exactly that and the yin yang necklace did it for me	17
1	i purchased this item as a present for my friend and i the piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone i myself have the yin half of the duo the only problem is that the black paint in the yin half is easily washed away now i do n't mean that it all washes away but it does erode the yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint however but i do worry about all of the paint eventually going away other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull i 'll definately be buying from this seller again	17
1	it 's a beautiful necklace and it was worth the cost it 's not filmsy or cheap it 's durable and great	17
1	the necklace arrived quickly especially considering that it came from thailand good quality for a good price thanks for good service will be buying jewelry from this seller again	17
1	this is a very pretty omega that goes well with many different pendants and looks great all by itself	17
1	this was an inexpensive ring for a great price it was a good buy for a hs niece who loves her celtic heritage and the color blue	17
1	it was just what i wanted i wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking	17
1	i did n't realize how picky my taste is with rings until i scoured amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me this ring is one of the few i found and i am far from a fan of having stones in my rings it has a nice low profile i 've yet to have it catch on anything i'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings but this again managed to sidestep that distaste the stone has no backing so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle tinted by my finger	17
1	i read the reviews of the other buyers while i was purchasing ing this ring the first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect i promised myself i 'd write a true review of the ring once i recieved my own the stone is neither large nor gawdy the silver pattern is slighty thick for my tastes however not noticably thick the stone is not high nor fake looking the picture gives an acurate display of the product all in all it 's a beautiful ring and a lovely buy for the price asked	17
1	i was concerned the stone would stick up too high on my finger instead it 's the perfect height i was concerned about ordering off the internet but i'm very pleased with the speed of service and the quality of the topaz is very good	17
1	i'm quite happy with these and writing to say so because other users' comments were very helpful to me especially the person who said that the earrings were substantial i e though diminutive they have bulk so are visible with nice warm glow	17
1	i bought these earrings for my 10 year old grandaughter for christmas i think she has worn them everyday since she loves them they are not large hoops if fact they are a bit small but perfect for her for an adult i think a little bit larger size would be better all in all i was very pleased with the earrings the quality is very good	17
1	when i first ordered these i wasnt expecting anything of high quality since their price was so low it was more of a side gift for my girlfriend but upon recieving i was taken back at how nice they really look you cant pass these up for the price shipping was very fast too	17
1	this cute little watch comes with a real eye patch my son loved it because he also wears an eye patch for his crossed eye	17
1	this was a stocking stuffer for christmas my grandson loved it and it is performing well	17
1	this is so cute and if you are a pig collector you need to add him to your collection the blue eyes and rhinestone ears are what make it nice pink color not too bright or too dull and so small it 's cute the little compartment can fit a few rings or earrings in it very very nice	17
1	do n't let the price of this cat necklace make you think it is tiny and almost invisible ! ! it is a very good size and the carving is great ! it was so inexpensive that i bought two of them i'm thinking i might give one to my fellow cat lover friend ! great item with a great price !	17
1	i bought this item for my grandaughter whose birthday is in august i think she will like it a lot i know i did	17
1	i was impressed with the quality and detail of the ring the person i bought it for loves it and as a jeweler herself that says alot i was afraid of the metals when i bought it but she has had no problems overall the ring is a gorgeous imitation of history and i would highly recommend it and the company i bought it from	17
1	it is what he wanted and you provided it for him thanks i made points as a good grandmother	17
1	this is a very grown up looking watch and my son who is seven loved it but it bothered him that it did n't fit very well the velcro part did n't go very far so it was too big and we ended up putting this one away for maybe next year and buying another timex that was easier to adjust which worked pretty well by the way	17
1	we bought this watch for my 8 year old who loves it we deliberately wanted him to develop his time telling skills \( i e no digital watches please ! \) and have a cool watch too the velcro strap the second hand water resistant qualities \( i can wear it in the shower mom ! \) and the indiglo face \( very cool in movie theaters \) made this a great buy	17
1	very well satisfied it 's great for a kid to learn to tell time and the design with velcro strap makes it very adjustable	17
1	i bought this as a holiday gift they 're a nice size clear stones with good purple color i'm very pleased with my purchase particularly considering the price if i were to change one thing i 'd have preferred larger backs and a sturdier post	17
1	my friend loved the watch and helped to bring her out of a bad mood	17
1	the watch is very colorful it is even safe to wear in the shower however the watch cannot be read in the dark and the hands are even hard to see in daylight it takes an extra few seconds to figure out wear the hands are but adults who ca n't get enough of harry should consider this watch	17
1	it 's a good value for money too rough on the edges	17
1	i have no problem with the watch i actually bought it for my son in law he seems happy with it it updates the time and date almost every night he says even though it keeps very good time without an up date	17
1	my husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek so this was the perfect christmas gift for him i was a little bit apprehensive when i recieved it but it works just like it should it is not apparent from the discription but this watch does have the date feature i could n't have gotten him a better gift for the price he wears it every day	17
1	works like advertised syncs well with atomic time from colorado \( i am in california \) looks nice	17
1	\( \) the watch has a nice weight beautiful face and is generously sized i need to have several links removed before i can wear it it comes nicely packaged although at first i did n't think that instructions and warranty paperwork were included they were hidden inside the top of the watch box it was difficult at first to pull out the pin in order to set the time but once i got the pin out it was a snap to adjust the date and time all in all an excellent watch for a great price !	17
1	i 've only had this watch for about a week so ca n't really comment about the long term durability however it is ultra cool watch although i 've not got a scale handy at the moment but it seems to be lighter than my ipod nano really a featherweight watch and therefore very comfortable to wear the dial color really ca n't be adaquately captured in a picture it is very attractive much more striking than the image indicates several people have asked where i purchased it i'm very happy with this choice	17
1	this skagen watch is full of class yet it 's perfect for casual wear too very thin so it 's not clunky like a lot of other watches titanium black and the band is black metal as well had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold but now it 's perfect and because it 's not an expansion braclet it 's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist i hope to have this for years to come because i 've not seen anything like it and the price is right too	17
1	this watch is so light and thin but so good looking that even my husband who does n't like watches weighing him down wears it every day after three months i do n't see any wearing away of the band and the face seems to really resist scratching because it still looks perfect	17
1	the watch is everything i hoped for except i wish the blue dial was a little brighter blue handsome as is just not impressive or eye catching other than that minor complaint it is very slim and very comfortable to wear you do n't even feel it on your arm	17
1	do n't buy this watch unless you want it \( and your good taste \) to be admired it 's just beautiful sort of like man jewelry for guys that do n't wear jewelry but i plan to wear it only when i wear certain clothing to certain events i have other watches for other situations	17
1	i loved this watch the moment i put it on at macy 's i get home to see if i could maybe get a better deal than 135 as always amazon comes through yet again with a price of 69 plus i do n't pay sales tax on it sold ! if you 've not seen this watch in person the pictures definitely do not do it justice	17
1	this watch is for occasions only you wear this one to weddings dance parties and or formal occassions 1 you do n't bring this to a fishing camp or use it climbing a rock face 2 it 's not a chonographic face so not for military so its not roughed enough to take out into the wilderness to go romping through with your m2a1 rifles its sole perpuse is to get stares and look pretty on occasions like birthday events let your girlfriends buy it for you guys i bought it because it was titanium mesh not because of it 's latching method again its almost 18th century it 's 21 century material used in place of a 18th century design	17
1	great looking watch looks just like the photo if not better very pleased with the quality and for a very affordable price	17
1	i had been looking at the skagen watches for six months and could not find any sales they are priced around 110 when i saw this particular model for 69 i was excited i read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions this watch arrived three days after i ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like i had bought at the store it was brand new and i love it i especially love it when i get something new on sale and a great deal amazon is a great place to order i get merchandise very quickly and at a great price	17
1	this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift she wears it everyday with every outfit it looks great with jeans and a t shirt and with an extravagent dress	17
1	this is a perfect anytime gift i bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it we have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top perfect for any occasion she 'll love it this will wow her but not worry her to think you are rushing anythingplus it 's under 100 ca n't beat the price thanks amazon	17
1	i wore the phoenix necklace at my first trip to the magic castle where i got compliments from the waiter and some of the magician	17
1	i came across this looking for angel pendants i bought this one and the matching earrings i absolutely love this pendant ! wear it all the time and always get compliments on it you can wear it year round ! one of the earrings fell out of my ear the first time i wore it ! would n't recommend those ! but this winged pendants is beautiful	17
1	i was pleased with this item my only criticism is that it is smaller than it appears in the pictures so i was decieved i was hoping for a larger pendant however my wife really likes it and it came with a nice little velvetine bag in which to store it	17
1	i love this pendant every time i wear it people want to know where i got it back in the 70 's we bought items that reminded us of the eagles and lynn skynn 's free bird so when i wear it it reminds me of the good old days yeah i know it 's a pheonix but whn i bought it was called an eagle \( ebay	17
1	i had the pendant in 3 days insted of 3 weeks ! and that from the us to the netherlands many thanks for that the pendant itself is perfect very detaild and it looks great	17
1	my girls love them the face of the watch is clear and easy to see they also like that it lights up	17
1	these watches are just as cute as they look in the ad this is 1 of 3 i bought for christmas all 3 girls really like them no one has had any trouble with them	17
1	i had an issue with my ring not being delivered in a timely matter i got in touch with the company and they had a new one delivered to me the next day the person i dealt with was very professional and i would definitely buy from this company again	17
1	i bought this for my wife for valentines day and she was elated she said they were the perfect size and weight when she 's happy i'm happy	17
1	these earrings are perfect ! perfect in size color and weight they 're not much bigger then a quater and very light in a beautiful white gold shine yes the post are thicker then most but after a few days you get use to them i had a pair like these that were given to me as a gift and i lost one when i found these on amazon i was n't sure how much they would be like my other they are a perfect match and my old pair was at least 7 8 years old if you want a perfect hoop that is good for day or night these are the ones	17
1	i was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick however i think it 's a decent buy for only 30 00 i bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend it comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch very clean presentation when you open it up the white gold really shines the free shipping was fast and i do mean quick i ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day i 've never had a quicker shipment for free before if your looking for a great deal on white gold earings i think you 've found it	17
1	the picture for this pendant is deceiving it is a lot smaller than it appears i know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is nevertheless my wife likes it very much and that 's good enough for me the price was right at 18 00 so overall i think it was a good buy	17
1	being part irish and born 3 days after st patricks day hence my name i was lucky enough to find this item at amazon com and it is a top class item with a good finish the ring seems to keep it 's shine with no maintanence required as usual the service and delivery at amazon com is second to none as an american living in australia there are so many things i ca n't get in this country which is why i get things like jewelry from them could n't be happier with this ring	17
1	my cousin is pleased with this gift and began wearing as soon as she got it	17
1	i bought these for my sister for christmas and she absolutlely loved them	17
1	i was pleased when i received my earrings however they 're smaller in reality than what 's pictured on the website but they 're still pretty	17
1	very lovely for a good price and came less then a week after i ordered it with standard mail was very impresse	17
1	jewelry watcheslive well you 'll be always in a high spirit if you purchase this bracelet it 's a really good gift for your friends	17
1	the bracelet looks more expensive than it is i like wearing it	17
1	although i 've only had it a few weeks i have had many compliments and questions on where i got it it is detailed and solid with a great message would recommend it	17
1	loving the look of the rolex daytona i spotted this watch on amazon and just had to have one \( at the price \) arrived in a well padded display box with all parts of the watch and strap covered in a protective plastic so no scratches taking out a few links for that custom fit just took a couple of minutes the watch looks great better than the images on the web and it works as described other posters that have had issues should read the manual ! it does all of the chrono functions and has full adjustments for hand alignment etc fantastic	17
1	the watch looks and feels great i did a lot of looking around before i decided on this watch and i'm very happy with my choice ! i would recommend this watch to anyone who is in the market for a very good watch at an even better price well done invicta and amazon on a great product	17
1	i sent this watch to my five year old grandson as his birthday gift he was very proud wearing it because the second hand had a soccer ball on it and the strap did not need adjusting besides he started playing soccer at that time	17
1	i am not much for this watch but it is exactly what i paid for i knew it was n't going to excite me becasue it 's a kids watch it 's ok for a kids watch	17
1	i am the type of person who has to have a watch on i feel lost without it therefore my watch has to be something that i can wear every day but i also wanted something that can go with a dressier outfit and this watch is wonderful i 've heard that skagen is a good brand and it 's true it 's very lightweight beautiful \( i love the little crystals at each number \) and durable great buy	17
1	price point was excellent product quality is really good shipped on time was priced 50 compared to dillard 's locally and no taxes no shipping fees	17
1	i bought this for almost 50 less than it sells in the local department store and am happy with my purchase the only trouble i have had is with the clasp it is a little tricky and you have to make sure that is catches correctly i found my watch on the floor recently because the clasp came open	17
1	it 's not the most expensive watch but it does n't have to be it 's a looker of a watch classy clean and sharp looking mesh band on the wrist \( any i have a skagen also \) is most comfortable and easy to use and sure locking terrific buy price	17
1	this watch is great looks great and feels great the hands clicking sound is almost none ! overall nice watch very happy with it	17
1	i 've purchased this watch from mid watch company as you can see it 's a fab casual watch and is worth the price the service was great and on time and i am very pleased with this purchase thank you	17
1	my son loves his new timex watch it has an elastic band that is easy for him to slip on and off he wears it every day and he is getting so much better at telling time ! if you push a button the face lights up my son enjoys using this to tell time in the dark	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend he absolutely loves this product it holds his money in the clipper and his credit cards on the opposite side it 's beautiful silver and looks very professional	17
1	i bought this watch for my bf on v day i ordered it on 2 10 and the order was here online fast shipping and item was in good shape will do business again in the future	17
1	the fossil watch bentley gunmetal it is an excellent purchase because it is a watch of high quality and to a good price if they want to have a quality watch and that it likes the people who know they do not doubt in buying it	17
1	apart of great look and seem durability it is strange feature in such kind of dial you have chronograph but you do not have idea where it stops 23 or 26 seconds \? difficult to find out with such a dial	17
1	i really like this watch looks nice and has all the features i wanted	17
1	i received this watch from santa and boy did he do a good job i love it ! it is a very nice watch and it has handle the russle and tussle of a single mom 's life without much marks ca n't beat the price	17
1	even if you are not buy this watch i am a nurse much like many of the other reviewers in fact i bought it due to their reviews it is a fantastic watch easy to read has an illumination option and a handy date feature the only trouble i have is the size of the band \( too long \) i will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out however the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy \( it 's not \) do n't even bother looking for another watch this one is a steal	17
1	the wife has a hard time with watches and this one has made her very happy	17
1	i was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch its almost 0 5in thick and the bezel is a full 1 5in across so the case is a bit bigger than that the mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable but the clarity is just average in addition to having glow in the dark markings \( which do n't work too well \) on the hands and dial markers it also has an indiglo style back light \( which does work well \) the bezel only rotates counter clockwise and it seems very tight at first overall it 's a decent everyday watch	17
1	the styling on this watch is very nice the silver and the grey colors look really good the lightweight titanium is great and the size is just right now for what i do n't like about it first after purchasing online i took it to a jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out i'm out 15 for that the the clasp pin has broken twice another 20 for repair and the watch is loud when i'm driving to work or am sitting in the office and everything is quiet i can hear the ticking i do n't guess that should bother me but it does	17
1	the watch is very lightwieght and is scratch resistant so far ! i wear it at work everyday and its holding up great ! enjoy the watch and always buy from amazon	17
1	i bought this watch because i wanted something inexpensive but still professional looking i like the lightness of the watch the thin size and the simple design it does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than i would like but still not very noticeable if you have n't seen other comments about getting the watch sized pay attention i took it to a professional jewelry repair shop and they still could n't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches i would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while the jeweler i went to has a good reputation but does not sell skagen	17
1	exceptional value in a classy and understated design keeps time in a superior fashion highly recommended	17
1	as other people have pointed out this is a very solid watch i really am not afraid of it breaking if it falls or anything like that however this is partly due to its enormous thickness it 's not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large it 's how thick it is if you have a small wrist this watch is probably not for you as it will be very noticeable it 's also not especially light obviously but it feels comfortable enough it keeps excellent time and i 've had no problems with the automatic signal searching	17
1	this is a very nice affordable watch i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will always be accurate people who own 1000 watches ask me about it a lot when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night and that i only paid 60 for it while on sale from amazon they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches	17
1	it 's a very stylish watch and i get compliments on it all the time but the display for the functions like stopwatch alarm and date display are small and hard to see also the date is off and i have n't been able to properly set it	17
1	i bought this watch as a gift for a friend who requested this exact one he loves it personally the lights that come on and off far too frequently for no reason would be a little too much for me it is certainly the largest wrist watch i have come across but if this is what you 're looking for and knowing that it is a g shock which makes it a great watch this is the one for you	17
1	this watch does a lot in a large light case i was impressed when it set itself during the recent time change very nice	17
1	bought this beautiful necklace for my daughters b day she loves it and now other family members want me to get one for them	17
1	this is a lovely necklace but the pendant part is smaller than it looks in the picture very pretty overall	17
1	i 've seen very inconsistant reviews for silver insanity items i received this necklace for christmas last year and it 's pretty nice generally i always receive a compliment when i wear it for the price it 's worth it if you 're looking for something nicer you 're simply going to have to pay more	17
1	i own many watches including some very expensive ones such quality looks for 1 10 of the price ! this watch is classy and the quality is second to none awesome !	17
1	i bought this watch for my husband and he absolutely loves it he has received many compliments it is high quality and arrived in perfect condition it is great as an everyday watch and still nice enough to wear for dressier occasions as well almost bought the watch at a dept store but saved 25 using amazon great product !	17
1	i recieved this watch for christmas and i'm still blown away looking at it had to take it to a jewelry shop to remove a link \( my wrists are small \) because the links are difficult to do themselves but that 's probably just for emphasis on quality it came in a fossil christmas tin very well packaged i'm very satisfied and recommend it for someone looking for a nice dress watch for their collection	17
1	baeutiful watch offered at a great price delivered very quickly a	17
1	im 14 and i go to school i bought this watch because i got a nice allowence and wow the people at school thinks im rich and cool ! ! ! ! !	17
1	it 's a great watch for the price i think i paid 130 for it it runs great keeps good time and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money high quality work very close in look feel weight to a r lex we 'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time but other than that it 's a great watch	17
1	has the effect of thousends watch i love it one of the best deals i`ve had from amazon this last years	17
1	believe it this is a stunningly beautiful watch and no one will guess the price unless you tell them it gets more attention than my gold rolex ! as for the weight it is normal for stainless which means a solid feel and you know it 's there if someone wants a flyweight watch why would they buy stainless steel \? it reliably functions exactly as described you 'll love this watch buy the 5 year extended warranty for 25 and enjoy it p s if you need to remove links just put a smoothed paperclip in a vice to push the pins out no big deal	17
1	the watch was even more attractive than it appeared i had none of the noise problems that were described in other reviews the mesh bracelet is not as comfortable as the leather bands i am used to in low light it is sometimes difficult to see \( my eyesight is good \) but basically i am very satisfied	17
1	received this watch in timely manner very pleasantlysurprised at feeling of weight solid constructionand ruggedness had about given up at getting a watchwith digital dial that was not a casio plastic watch have recently bought the soloman stainless version anda gold vestal model will let my relatives choose whichwatch suits them as a gift gene setchell	17
1	it broke the first time i tried to put it on i 's very beautiful and the others did just fine thank you sincerely gai	17
1	i read the reviews on this diamond just before christmas when it was on sale for 99 00 the diamonds are better then expected and i consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks no visible flaws i am sure if i used a loop i could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair their great for 99 00 diamonds	17
1	this one is excellent for the price good build and accurate i wish it had alert function	17
1	very handsome easy to read face and date window especially like the day date display most watches in this price range feature date only excellent value	17
1	i got this set as a party gift for a sleep over for my kids they loved it and the price was really hard to beat	17
1	the dial is big for some people but being it 's a diving watch i would expect nothing less this is a beautiful piece of machinery and i wear it everyday	17
1	i'm a pretty big guy so it does n't look out of place but this is really an extra large watch that is also quite heavy it runs well keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability if you 're an extra large person and do n't mind a heavy watch you may be interested in this if you 're average size or smaller i would n't recommend it personally this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet proof in normal use	17
1	i like this watch it 's good price and also cool look \) hey guys you will not lose anythings if you have one like it	17
1	i presented it to my sister 's daughter and she loved it very much she loved cell phone watch and even box i felt very happy and i would suggest any one to buy this item	17
1	the ring is better in real life than the picture but you still get what you pay for	17
1	this pendant is really nice i bought it as a gift it is just the pendant so you do have to get a chain	17
1	they are comfy and i am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals i can not the thing is i have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears i think but other than that they are just fine	17
1	i just recently had my ears pierced and needed something small that i could wear continually on a daily casual basis without the earrings looking too dressy these earrings are just perfect for that purpose they are simple elegance with genuine pearls and sterling silver findings they are even confortable enough to wear while sleeping i am wearing the white pearl set right now love them !	17
1	i love these ! they are such a good deal for the price and come in a nice box they are much better than what i was expecting \) colours are a nice pastel and would go with lots of different things pearls are large but not too large just right	17
1	we happened across these as a gold box item and decided they were the perfect size and color for our daughter as an easter present they came nicely packaged and are some of her favorites my wife now wants the same in different colors	17
1	all right so these earrings are absolutely adorable ! they are fun and go with anything ! good size good quality i would buy for someone as a gift	17
1	these earrings are really pretty there are not real great variations in the color between each set \( they are all pastel after all ! \) but each has a beautiful sheen and color they are also set very firmly on the backs i was worried that for the price they would n't hold up but they are very nicely made the packaging was okay but not deluxe what i appreciated was that there was a little flyer enclosed telling how to take care of pearls which i found informative all in all a good purchase and well worth the money	17
1	i am very pleased with the pretty shades of the pearls and the size was even bigger than i expected the only thing that would have them even better was bigger flat backings i have very small ear lobes so they flopped forward i remedied that by changing the backings i am wearing them with so many things and really enjoying them	17
1	as with all natural pearls the shapes are not perfect only cultured pearls are perfect because man controls them the dye is uniform and the size is perfect big enough that they can be seen easily the colors pink white gold and lavender are clear even the green is a clear green just not my favorite green	17
1	i was skeptical about this watch because of the very low price but i was very pleasantly surprised it has a quality finish and band is comfortable and works great here on the east coast it reliably synchs with the colorado time signal so it 's always accurate great watch for the money i highly recommend this yellow dial watch and its black and blue dial siblings	17
1	i purchased one of the casio men 's atomic waveceptor yellow dial watch vq200hda 9bvcf from amazon this watch is great it updates the time automatically \( just switched to daylight savings and i did n't have to touch a thing \) instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates my watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine i saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back this is a must to allow the auto updates again cool looking great watch ! ! ! !	17
1	it is a nice watch for the dollar spent on this item the catch is that it will work with the concept of wave ceptor and it adjusts time according to the place you are in so good watch !	17
1	i gave this necklace to my daughter who was becoming a new big sister and she just loved it the necklace was very symbolic because the big heart represented big sister and the little heart represented little sister holding on i just loved it	17
1	the quality of this piece is really surprising ! i purchased this as a gift for a 16 year old when i received it i immediately loved the styling and the chain i was very pleased to have found such an appropriate lovely gift at such a great price	17
1	i used this necklace as a matching piece to my fiance 's marquise heavy engagment ring it is a beautiful contemporary piece of jewelry it 's symmetry and simplicity are hard to find in sea of gawdy overly embellished jewelry pieces it 's a great buy and my fiance loves it	17
1	the photo of the necklace looked pretty but i did n't realize it would be so nice ! my daughter loved it and i will probably purchase one for myself	17
1	this is my first silver necklace i have had it on since i purchased it and i have received a lot of complements it is also comfortable to wear	17
1	this pendant is much prettier in person it 's got a nice polished finish not satin matte like in the image it hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain i 've already received several compliments on it	17
1	my wife has a problem with earrings because she needs a small prong i ordered her other earrings but i had to return them because they hurt her ears these were a nice change because she can wear them without the pain plus she loves them	17
1	the watch was in perfect condition and arrived much earlier than anticipated we were very pleased with this purchase plus i could n't have asked for a better price	17
1	this is an excelllent watch and it does what it promises to be	17
1	i love this watch i 've had it for almost a year its absolutely beautiful but simple it keeps time very well for the work i do i do n't wear this watch to work so i can go sometimes a full week without wearing it the hands stop after sitting still for 24 hours but as soon as i pick it back up and give it a shake the hands spin around and sets itself its not to dressy for casual wear but it also fits perfectly with a suit and tie i highly recommend it !	17
1	i bought this watch as a gift for my boyfriend and he was pleasantly surprised to say the least the human powered kinetic movement of the watch really appeals to the gadget lover in any guy and the sapphire crystal face of the watch will not scratch although i bought the black faced kinetic coutoura seiko the gold silver version of this watch is lovely also great quality gorgeous appearance reasonable price definitely consider this watch	17
1	i just bought this pin to put in my hair for my upcoming wedding i love it ! it 's really sparkly and gorgeous i also accidentally dropped it on tile flooring and it did n't break very nice pin	17
1	i purchased this watch for my father as a gift the blue face is beautiful the numbers are easy to read it 's light weight and keeps perfect time he loves this watch and has had many compliments since he started wearing it	17
1	i bought two of these one each for dh ds and both have found it perfect apart from having to remove a few links \( if you 've got thick wrists it is perfect indeed	17
1	i brought this for a good friend for the xmas 2006 season he just loved it and claimed that it is quite beautifu	17
1	i received a lovely pendant necklace several years ago and wear it everywhere but my long hair always tangles in the chain and trying to get the hair out usually breaks the chain i average buying about 4 new chains a year since purchasing this chain my hair is not tangled nor ripped out by the links clothing fiber does n't catch on it my pendant does not get stuck on the clasp in short this is the worlds most perfect chain ! i cannot tell you how happy i am with this purchase	17
1	this thing is a rock ! ! its heavy indeed i like that it definetelly feels when i have it on its been taking hits since last year with no scratches what soever everyone that see it loves it the picture dont do any good you have to see it and feel it in your han	17
1	the watch was shipped in a timely manner actually i receive the watch a few days sooner than the expected delivery date i purchased this product as a gift for my son when i opened the package it was everything the site said it would be and more my son and i am very pleased with the watch i do agree with a previous review stating that this watch is not for a small frame man although this is not a problem for me because my son likes the larger watches i took it to have it resized for him and it fits perfect	17
1	this is a great and stylish watch i always get compliments it is heavy sturdy and looks much more expensive than what the actual price was it looks great with any suit and looks really good with a nice blue shirt highly recommended the stainless steel is much shinnier than what the picture shows ignore the comment below you will be happy with this watch !	17
1	this is a great watch ! ! ! ! it feels heavy it 's big it looks awesome with a blue shirt and it will distinguish you in any crowd ! you can wear it as a dress watch or with a sports shirt it just looks great ! the best fossil i 've ever bough	17
1	nice bracelet for the price good for gifts for friends \( which is what i purchased them for \) everyone was very happy with them	17
1	bought several of these bracelets for christmas gifts ! they were a big hit ! perfect for someone who need a little pick me up	17
1	service was prompt and the earings are beautiful i get compliments on them all the time and my sister asked for them on her birthday	17
1	had these on my wish list and received them as a gift they are even more lovely in person they are one of my favorite pairs i wear them all the time they 're very simple yet elegant and very well made especially for the price i will definitely buy more from this company	17
1	i first came across the silver insanity line of celtic jewelry last year when i was looking for christmas presents jackpot ! i confess i spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items both on amazon and on the silver insanity website the teardrop earrings i picked out were quite a success so much so that i recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver celtic knot earrings for myself i 've been very happy with my selection and i just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend i highly recommend the items from silver insanity and plan to order from them again	17
1	i really like my earrings that i bought and they came in time	17
1	having only owned fossil watches prior to this one i must say that i was a little jaded my latest fossil bit the dust after many long good years of use i happened to find this just browsing one day and was hooked by the color and overall design i have to say i was highly impressed with what i received it is an absolutely beautiful watch	17
1	great product for the price espeacially for a starter set fear not you cant go wrong here	17
1	i bought this set for part of my fiancee 's christmas and she loves it ! the pearls are a very nice size they really are heavy and shine beautifully they are definitely worth the price	17
1	very nice size almost perfect shape beautiful luster and color great to wear with almost anything they are very chic and classy i'm very happy i bought them ! !	17
1	lovely jewelry great price but the clasp is pretty tough to work this is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers i'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert key type clasp it 's probably a great choice for very occassional use though with the quality and price it really is a regular use type of necklace i think it 's best suited for the nimble fingered traditional fashion person	17
1	i had always assumed that freshwater pearls were oddly shaped and not as attractive as their saltwater cousins this set put my assumptions to rest it is a beautiful set of pearls at a very competetive price	17
1	if you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and do n't really have a good frame of referance these are for you my wife was a jewler and she likes pearls i bought these and got positive feedback i was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great you will be ok if you go with these	17
1	cute earrings exactly what i expected to be and the shipping was super fast as well	17
1	beautiful detailed and very high quality for the price am very very pleased with the prompt shipping as well highly recomended	17
1	this watch comes in a cute box which shows what 's inside the contents are nicely spread out and the presentation is certainly appealling to the eyes of a little girl excellent product	17
1	these are beautiful earrings they are a bit small but the stones are vibrant and rich looking my only complaint is that the post part of the earring is not very substantial and i feel as though i need to handle them very carefully they are extremely comfortable and have just the right amount of movement to them	17
1	i received these earrings today and am delighted with them i read the reviews carefully so i knew the actual size of this item and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are the presentation \( bag and box \) is beautiful looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store i 've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in	17
1	paid 45 for these and worth every penny they are delicate the color is brilliant the stones are very clear i wore them to work as soon as i got them and received more than a few compliments on them they would make a wonderful gift for someone and even better for yourself	17
1	they are beautiful and delicate i just love the way they sparkle thanks amazon	17
1	i ordered a pair for myself and liked them stones are pretty clear n cute but earrings are smaller than shown in the picture	17
1	i got these earrings for my wedding in june they are beautiful and look better than pictured they arrived well ahead of the scheduled ship date and i am very happy with them	17
1	another nice inexpensive tool that makes tedious work go much faster and easier	17
1	the bracelet did n't look as i expected from looking at the picture but is very pretty i did n't realize it would be so delicate looking because there is nothing to compare it to in the image it is very nice though it is small thin the kind of thing you might wear with a dress yet seems strong the metalwork seems done well and i think it 's a bracelet that would be right for wearing someplace special	17
1	the watch is just as discribed it is heavy and large the person i bought it for had to get several links removed it would be great for a larger man	17
1	it 's a fantastic watch a little heavy and bit of work is required to adjust the band overall the nice blue background stands out quite nicely it 's on the money with keeping time too	17
1	she loves the cross i thought it was a little bigger than it was but she loved it as it was	17
1	i ordered this as a gift for my niece 's birthday and after receiving it wanted to keep it for myself ! it 's very delicate and dainty however the chain and the cross actually looked like they were very sturdy	17
1	my daughter loved it the chain needs to be 2 inches longer	17
1	i bought this for my sister for christmas i have a similar one that is bigger that i bought while in charleston sc she fell in love with mine and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question i decided on this one at first when it arrived i thought it would be too small but my sister does not wear large neclaces earrings etc turns out she loved it it was just perfect for her especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive	17
1	the 18 description is for the necklace on it 's longest extended setting without using the extended part of the chain it is really closer to being child sized it is pretty and will end up being a gift for my daughter rather than the friend i had intended to give it to	17
1	i bought this for a 2006 christmas gift and i am very pleased i know my daughter will be too it comes in a pretty purple velvet bag a nice box with cotton and includes instructions on how to keep it nice i got it at a great discount at one of the friday sales	17
1	i am 89 years old and i love this necklace ! whoever said old ladies can not wear fashion things are nuts ! i wear this with everything from my fridayy night bingo nights to clubing in l a with lindsey and pari	17
1	i received this pair of hoop earrings as a christmas gift from my boyfriend when i first open the box i thought they were earrings for an infant the earrings are very very small however they are cute as i started wearing the earrings i began to really like them they are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession if you really like dainty jewelry i highly recommend this item	17
1	nice watch that keeps super accurate time however it is very basic showing only the time and date it would be nice if it had backlighting but the hands do glow in the dark for some period of time it is a little tricky to pick up the time signal so i would recommend finding a place in your home where the signal is strong and leave it there every night	17
1	this is so very handy you can adjust your own instead of dropping it off at a jeweler and waiting for it	17
1	i ordered these earrings a little over two months ago and i am very happy with them they are very light weight and they do not pull on your ears the size is perfect very in right now you do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight however so far so good they have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything i even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine they were completely fine afterward i do wish the earrings had been about 20 less expensive but overall i love my earrings	17
1	the first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed to amazons credit they sent me a new one right away this watch is fine i needed a rubber band because i am in water a great deal of the time at workand i live near the ocean i am always in the water with my children so far the watch is great and has held up to expectations no problems except when the first one was shipped broken i would buy it again	17
1	i wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son and came upon this ring when it arrived i really was in awe of just how beautiful it is ! it is a larger more bold ring definitely more masculine this is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love it 's too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only 12 hopefully i can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice	17
1	i love these earrings ! they are simple yet elegant what 's really great about them is that for a change i can wear long earrings without feeling that my ear is being pulled to the ground ! !	17

1	great value quality and craftsmanship back up with excellent service ! the stones are clear and brilliant thanks ! r caspers5 out of 5 stars jewelry	17
1	i actually bought these two years ago then again for my mother this past christmas we both love the sets they 're great for someone looking to start or expand their collection the colors of the stones were very nice and equally matched nice size not too small not too big	17
1	this is not the first tool i'ld add to my work bench but it has some pieces i'm glad to have i re sized my watch band in just a few minutes and only had one little incident with doing something the wrong way did i mention that the instructions are somewhat lacking \? in hind sight i should have figured it out before i made the mistake but that 's hind sight for you if your good with working with tools and you have a need to adjust a watchband at least every christmas then this is a good deal	17
1	i do n't know for whom watchebands are sized perhaps the incredible hulk in his green phase \? all i know is i'm constantly resizing my watchband based on the band the climate my activities this procedure can be somewhat difficult with some bands this complete kit does the trick a couple of minutes and a clear spot on my desk and i'm done could n't get much simpler i finally got this kit after wrestling with a new fossil band that would not cooperate used this kit and the bugger was vanquished in a trice wish i had it years ago	17
1	this is a great tool set the first day i had it we used it to take out a link from my new watch it worked great i'm glad i bought it it will be a very handytool kit	17
1	great kit for working with watches the tools were quite good quality and not flimsy and cheap the case was also good and thankfully was n't just the typical throw away plastic crap the inside of the case is firm foam that keeps the tools nicely in place the case itself is firm black leather like material and snaps closed the kit contains a hammer band holding base and several different sized pin drivers for removing band pins also includes the clamp type pin remover \( the blue thing \) a set of screwdrivers and a thin but sturdy wedge for removing watch backs all in all i'm quite pleased with the product it was just what i wanted and was n't very expensive	17
1	atomic watches are highly accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive u s atomic clock in ft collins colorado thus all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches casio makes and amazon sells a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes but all are equally accurate the casio g shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models such as this never require battery replacement atomic accurary solar power and g shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price	17
1	keeps time very well \( obviously \) no problems getting signal to sync with atomic clock chrono second time zone all other functions work well love the light function better than any indiglo i have owned only quibble is that the alarm needs to be louder	17
1	this is the best g shock i have owned it looks sleek as well as casual i had no trouble receiving the nightly signal \( i live in northern new jersey \) the solar power is an added bonus a really good deal for the money	17
1	i just received this watch and i have to say it 's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it this is not a flimsy watch by any means it 's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest i have ever had to negotiate of all the watches i have gone through over the years it 's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp i would recommend this watch to anyone also it 's dressy and casual all purpose watch	17

1	an absolutely beautiful medallion and for the price a no brainer ! my wife loved it	17
1	this item arrived in a timely manner extremely well packaged and exactly as advertised a	17
1	i ordered this watch for my husband he absolutely loved it ! thewatch band is designed narrower at the point where it connects with the watch my husband especially like that design because he says he can wear it for extended periods without the band pinching or rubbing his wrist i was unsure what the quality would be because of the low price however the watch was an excellent quality product tmccann f	17
1	silver insanity does it again bringing high quality unique jewellery to the masses at affordable prices this necklace is so gorgeous one has to see it up close to fully appreciate it it is so detailed even the tiny thorns are so delicate and perfectly placed this is such a beautiful piece of jewellery that no woman should be without this valentine 's day \( or anniversary or birthday \) instead of buying your woman chocolates that she does n't need or flowers that will die after a few days buy her a gorgeous unique rose that will last forever	17
1	i think the necklace is beautiful it 's exactly what i expected i really love it !	17
1	the charm is gorgeous any mother would love it from their husband or children but okay if you are buying this necklace for a mother under the age of 30 they will be okay with the length of the chain if you are buying the chain especially for a woman who is over the age of 40 they might be bothered by the short chain or if they have a large neck not saying my mother has a large neck she just has three surgery scars that the short rubbing chain bothers	17
1	i was pleasantly surprised with the high 0quality of the merchandise my mother in law loved it	17
1	its a nice necklace for your mom no matter the age im sure she 'll appreciate it i was not quite sure what to expect but i was unexpectedly surprised that it is really pretty and lustrous i guarantee that you will be pleased and your mom will love it	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and had it engraved at things remembered it looks really nice and very chic with the engraving he loves it and it has come in a lot of use the only bad things are 1 the rectangular hole on one side \( the side not shown \) and 2 the shiny side will obviously get some scratches on i	17
1	these watches are just what my little boy was looking for since his identical watch broke he was so happy i not only found 1 but 6 for the price of one these are nice for a child who is just learning to tell time	17
1	they 're cool some break to easily but others dont it does not feel like you are wearing a watch and they are very small its just like i said they break easily but i would give it 4	17
1	the earrings are lovely especially given the bargain price they came in a nice box too so if you want to give them as a gift they make a nice presentation overall could n't beat this deal	17
1	great quality well made and best results with amazon thanks and five stars brav	17
1	these earrings are beautiful they are big so they look best if worn by themselves very light so they are very comfortable	17
1	my 3 year old son loves this watch you can change all of the pieces of the band to different colors and different sizes it clicks on easily and does n't come off even on a child 's arm i am very happy with this watch	17
1	if your little guy or gal is struggling with telling time and is a lego fan this is the best deal money can buy under 20 and is expandable etc probably not the most durable diver type watch you 'll ever buy but it is really good looking easy to assemble \( it 's a lego \) and all the kids think it 's neat to boot	17
1	original concept it generates imagination through the different colors and designs the child can create and is a reliable watch too ! all that for an afordable price	17
1	his wrist was too small for mens too masculine for a womans watch but way too grown up for those babyish kiddie watches this is the perfect accessory for all of your lego maniacs ! fun to re design as well	17
1	i purchased this watch for my 7 year old son it is a eye catching and because it 's lego it was an instant hit it has numbers on the face \( not roman numerals or lines \) which is important when they are beginning to tell time the price is fair the only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic it gets a bit sweaty all in all it 's a fun cool ! watch	17
1	the keyring is very nice i had no idea just how light titanium is the caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight it 's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed making the ring kinda useless definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it additinally the metal is quite plyable and i 've had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys	17
1	i must say i was hesitant to buy after reading the reviews but they are for my two year old so i figured they really could n't be too small and they are not i also purchased other earring from some other vender for a lot more and guess what the quality of theese is soooo much better all in all yes they are tiny but very cute and do n't lack detail ! will buy again	17
1	the shape of this pendant is very flattering \( elongated draws the eye downward \) it looks great with the windows hoops i purchased at the same time the chain is nice and as with all zina sterling the silver is very polished and beautiful	17
1	i wear it almost everyday and it 's a lot of fun to change out the wrist band	17
1	i bought this watch for my 5 yr old and though it works just fine the watchband is way too big for him fortunately i am handy with a sewing machine and was able to take a pinch in the band but it makes it bulky and uncomfortable therefore he only wears it in bed so that he can play with the indiglo feature in the dark as soon as he gets up in the morning though he takes it off	17
1	i just bought this ring it is really beautiful it is a litttle bigger than i thought it would be but it fits good and was shipped quickly it was a really good buy	17
1	pretty pendant for the price the chain is very light but the pendant itself is nice and hangs well	17
1	this is the second item i have ordered from this company and i am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money i would recommend them to anyone	17
1	these earrings are quite nice yes they do look brown up to the light but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow they can be worn to accent an elegant look or add style to a friday casual look they may not be heirloom quality but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category	17
1	fast and easy ordering received frequent order status updates received order as expected \( fast \) i love these earrings i have worn at least one day a week since i receive	17
1	i love puzzle rings in england it 's real difficult to find themi love the jewellery on amazo	17
1	i bought this as a present for my daughter i was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring \( if anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together check wikipedia i believe there is even a video \) i highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver symbolism and something just a little bit different	17
1	nice ring fast delivery i still need to check it out because my daughter says it does n't completely break down the way my old puzzle ring did	17
1	this watch is a delightful present amazon did a great job in delivering it on time and in excellent condition and as stated in the previous review it does look better than even on the picture ! keep up the fantastic work amazon you guys are a great realiable trustworthy source to send out gifts to loved ones in the us ordered from outside the us	17
1	this is a very nice watch the pink mother of pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft the date is a little small but the watch is so nice that i did n't even care the only complaint i have is that amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside i had to get a new battery on my own but as soon as i told amazon they credited me the 10 that was great but they should have sent me a watch in working condition otherwise the watch is highly recommended even nicer than in the photo	17
1	i like the stop watch functions that this watch has i also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions unfortunately this watch is hard to read in bright light such as sunlight and well lit spaces overall though i like this watch because it looks good well it looks good on me anyway	17
1	it 's great looking the crystal positively gleams folks comment on it all the time i love this watch so much that i 've bought it twice \( lost it and simply had to replace it \)	17
1	great value looks and performes great ! ! ! ! ! ! has a lot of class and goes great with any type of apparel only down fall occurs when placing the alarm it 's kind off complex	17
1	i ordered 2 watches one for each grandaughter one arrived with dead battery had it replaced and both are working well they where well received by the granddaughter	17
1	got this today and ca n't stop looking at it it 's beautiful all who have seen it want one i cant wait to try more of their jewelry	17
1	i actually bought 2 different pair of diamond ear rings the 14k gold ones were the keepers ! they are pretty and big enough to use as a second pair in my ears ! thanks to amazon for this offering	17
1	i bought these for my wife and she really likes them they 're small enough that she can wear them day to day but they 're nice enough for formal occasions as well this is a very versatile set of earrings at a great price	17
1	i could n't belive my eyes when i saw diamond earrings with such an affordable price ! i definitely think that selecting white gold is the way to go because it wo n't distract from the mesmerizing glamour of the diamonds all my friends were wowed and shared that they will also consdier buying a pair i am so happy	17
1	these earrings are very small maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each they do appear white \( i do n't see any yellow tinting \) with a slight slight bit of grey which i prefer over a super white look \( as you might sometimes find in a cz \) these earrings catch the light nicely showing a bit of rainbow effect they are n't super super sparkly or faceted but they do possess shine and detail i am very happy with these earrings as they are just what i wanted something petite and real set in yellow gold and with a nice clean and believably sparkly look ! i also like the fit of the earrings backs very tight and secure	17
1	i really like it it 's an excellent watch and also a very elegant one	17
1	i bought these for my wife and she liked them very much 7mm is not as small as you may think i certainly would n't buy anything larger in this style i got them on sale for 15 00 ca n't go wrong with that price for 14k gold	17
1	i bought these earrings as a christmas gift for my wife and they look great my wife has long dark hair and the 7mm size really stands out they came in a dark blue velvet jewel ring box which comes in another dark blue box my wife really loves them so that 's a bonus for me they are a nice little something for yourself or as a gift	17
1	bellisimos los zarcillos los uso muy a menudo y el tiempo en que hice la orden fue bien rapida su entrega su tama o real concuerda con las medidas que ofrecen	17
1	these earrings just arrived and for 10 \( friday sale \) you cannot beat this value luckily i bought two pair one as a gift and one for me on the off chance i liked them otherwise i thought i could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters no way the second pair is mine	17
1	the box is soft and very durable but it is a bit big	17
1	this heart box is great for your skagen or other brand watches or you can use it as a jewlery box for your bracelets the box makes a v day or anniversary gift even more special your loved ones will appreciate the box as a sentimental reminder of the special gift the watch pillow is plush padded box top and outside inside box is lined with velvet	17
1	i am not the type of person that wears jewelry but when i went shoping for a watch because i needed one one brand caught my eye fossil everyone knows fossil so everyone knows that they make good watches i like this watch because of the color and because it has the day on the face it is like your everyday watch but with that bling look very cool and very james bond if you know what i mean i plan to wear this watch everywhere i go you should get this one not only because it looks cool but because of the price you know that makes up your mind for you	17
1	i bought this along with the butterfly pendant and 18 chain for a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter and she loves them both i loved the price ! the earrings are a perfect fit with the necklace she says she only wears them to church and special occasions a great gift for teenage girls	17
1	i'm very pleased with these earrings they are a good weight they are n't so heavy that they drag at the ear but they are substantial and a perfect size i 'd recommend these to earring lovers	17
1	these earrings are beautifully made look great when put on and come at a great price all these ingredients make a stunning value i am a very pleased customer	17
1	i had these on my wish list and decided to order them for myself after christmas after looking in stores and not finding anything that looked quite the same ! they just arrived and all i can say is wow ! nice look substantial size and plenty of statement picture does not do them justice all i can say is do n't hesitate you will be dissappointed if they sell out	17
1	how can you go wrong with these two tone hoops \? they are stylish and substantial and perfect for both white and yellow gold lovers highly recommended for yourself or as a gift	17
1	my 26 yr old son got this for his birthday he loved it and wears at always	17
1	i bought this as a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter michelle she absolutely adored it she told me she only wears it to church and special occasions i loved the price	17
1	this is a great choice for a business casual style watch with it 's crystal clear face and smooth shape it complements most business attire nicely the adjustment button does n't get pulled easily so there is less chance of accidental time loss after several weeks of wear still no scratches on the watchface and the metal remains untarnished i still get questions about it definitely an eye catcher	17
1	this watch was a very good buy for 45 looks like a nice 85 90 fossil watch the dial looks very elegant with those numbers overall i am very happy with this buy	17
1	great watch looks very similar to a movado but worth the price sharp look and perfect for any occasion	17
1	the watch i purchased was great and a lifesaver because i could n't find it in any stores and needed it as a gift for the best man at my wedding it got to me quickly and was perfect thanks	17
1	the watch itself looks preety elegant however the bracelet is a bit too rigid and it cand be very unconfortable until you get used to it i do n't regret buying it it 's worth the money	17
1	is a nice clock some people tall to me about the clock the people say is nice the clock	17
1	got this watch for my one son for christmas but ended up going to the other son since his arm is on the small size and this is a pretty good size watch it is beautiful and well described arrived in perfect condition and had no problem requesting extra links using the fossil toll free and then the local store that sells fossils put the links in for me i went with a small dress watch for the other son everyone was happy	17
1	greetings exelente product and magnifies attention from the store thanks kindly domenico pascarell	17

1	i am very impressed with the detail work on this ring it is really eye catching and quite lovely the shipment arrived very quickly the stone is a true emerald shade of green and the cut is nice but the clarity of the stone could be a little better however for the price it is an excellent ring and i would gladly give it as a gift	17
1	this was a gift and i was very pleased with both the quality and extremely fast shipping i will definitely purchased from this seller again	17
1	this ring is beauriful and eye catching i unfortunatey wore it in a hot tub that had too much clorine in it so the shinyness of the metal faded and despite that the ring remains beautiful	17
1	i was searching the web for weeks i saw thousands of watches and i did n't like them when i saw this watch that was it one of the most beautiful watches in the world i think design of this watch is superb very simple but astonishingly beautiful and original but there is one problem with this watch it can be purchased only in north america being from europe i had difficulties to get it	17
1	i have thoroughly enjoyed these earrings very nice size and great quality they are light weight and have a great hinge i have a baby who sometimes grabs them but they have yet to be bent out of shape i sometimes keep them in for days at a time and my sensitive ears do n't ever develope a reaction	17
1	this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift she wears it everyday with every outfit it looks great with jeans and a t shirt and with an extravagent dress	17

1	i really love these earrings and wear them quite a bit to spice up work clothes	17
1	i really like them they look elegent on me one of the most favorite parts besides the looks that i especially like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place this reduces the risk of losing them but they are also light enough that i don t feel bogged down with them on my ears	17
1	not much else o say they look and wear awesome the price is very good as well recommend these for anyone with pierced ears	17
1	excellent quality beautifully packaged they were exactly as described and just what i was looking for	17

1	wonderful watch easy transaction given as a birthday present recipient loved that it came in a can	17
1	i have owned both the black monster with bracelet \( my daily work watch \) and the orange with the rubber strap \( which i sold to an envious friend \) besides all of the compliments that i have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job i have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that i would be most confident to wear at depth as usual seiko does not disappoint	17
1	purchased this for my niece and she loved it it 's a great price and bright and colorful	17
1	great value for the price better than expected in person quality watch for the price love this undersea face better than the other models out there was happy to find out that even though the band is kid sized it also fits adult women 's wrist highly recommend will probably buy one or 2 more	17
1	this was a gift for my 17 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it and wears all the time ! ! ! ! i am seriously thinking of getting myself one	17
1	very cute price efficiant only problem is if the band gets wet and you have sunscreen on your arm will get tinted blue	17
1	our granddaughter loves her horse necklace ! she wears it all the time and is so proud of it ! this necklace made her very happy	17
1	this is the most beautiful bracelet the piece is awesome the sentiment is so true i love this bracelet and decided to keep it even though i 'd bought it as a gift the workmanship is superb the bracelet arrived 2 days after i placed my order in a well packaged box the bracelet was in a white box with a gold ribbon around it	17
1	i bought two of these faux amber necklaces and they are quite well made the pendant is almost 2 inches in length it does look larger in the photograph but by being smaller it looks more realistic it is actually a good weight not to heavy not to light it looks as if some effort has been put into the making of it i think it is a good purchase for the price because it does not look cheap or tacky	17
1	i like the unique style of this necklace and received compliments on it when i wore it to work the price is reasonable for the type of necklace having such unique beads	17
1	these lovely little gems are perfect for those women who like me have a second or third ear piercing small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious these would make a great gift for a little girl as well i particularly liked the price point where they were being offered as i suffer from a nickel allergy and always wear gold posts in my ear having recently transitioned from yellow to white gold these were lovely additions to my collection at the price of under 10 dollars i was able to give them to a few others as a little hi there how are you	17
1	simple and elegant earrings my wife loves them however the backs are a trifle small to work with ba	17
1	i got these for 9 on the friday sale they are well made and the perfect size you absolutely will not find a better pair for the price wait for the friday sale if you can	17
1	this is a gift that has yet to be given i am confident that she will love them though	17
1	these are basic simple earrings of exceptional quality given the price you would likely pay far more for comparable items elsewhere	17
1	i am really happy with this purchase ! the earrings came together in an attractive box \( perfect as a gift but i do n't want to give them away \) they are nice and large on my earlobe and look great they are really soft to the touch and i like the colors too	17

1	i love this piece ! ! it is a beautiful quality and design it is lightweight and will look good with anything you wear	17
1	just received the necklace today and i am more than happy with it it arrived quickly and the packaging is fantastic ! it came in a little blue box and in a blue velvet bag very nicethe necklace is good quaility and has a great shine to it i might just have to order one for myself after xmas this one is a present	17
1	equal to my swiss watches fit and finish is very nice only two seconds off per day the luminessence is incredable reason not giving five starsbecause of not having saphire crystal	17
1	an excellent watch stylish accurate and takes a beating ! seiko has always had a success with this one and at 150 i paid half the retail price	17
1	the watch looks great prominent yet not overly large the orange really sets off the look the large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark i also like having both day and date complications and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than 300 \( way less on amazon \) is really a find you will need a pro to adjust the bracelet though as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler 's tools another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day overall i really like it it 's become my daily wear watch	17
1	the bracelet is a very bright and shiny quite nice it 's alot lighter than i was expecting i almost mistook it for plastic at first it would make a nice gift for a young teen girl	17
1	i bought three of these for friends for christmas and i have to say that i loved them and most of all they loved them they are gorgeous ! just enough sparkle without being too much i highly recommend this if you are looking for something classy and slightly understated	17
1	my granddaughter loves this bracelet i sent it as a surprise and she wore it to school the next day	17
1	i was a little worried that the bracelet would be too large for a 5 year old but i got this for my daughter 's birthday and it fits her perfectly i was also a little concerned that it might be cheap looking like other things i 've bought from amazon lately but it 's actually a very cute well made cheap bracelet	17
1	made a little girl very happy order processed shipped and delivered in a timely manner just as expected	17
1	good looking stylish smart and clean design handsome once i was specifically looking for animated watches this was one of the results although given amazon description is really lacking details i bought it and did n't really know what are the features in general and also specifically concerning the animation so now i know it has a button aside that is switching between two animation schemes one seconds numeric value rotates clockwise on the display two seconds drop down in two halfs on the display thats all for animation and features in general no light no more animations no stoppers timers nothing else just plain watch for me the good looks somewhat compensates the thing i was originally looking for	17
1	good tool it does what is it meant to do open the back of watches with ease man this is so much better than scratching watchbacks with pliers so far its been able to open all my watches with no issue	17
1	this garinin autowinder does exactly what it is supposed to do keeps both my autos running and ready for use it is quiet smooth and looks pretty good sitting atop my computer desk it has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market it is well built and works as described	17
1	i have had this winder for about a month now and i am very happy with it the major convenience is the well engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality the inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding all previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out \( with watches ! \) and eventually were rendered useless highly recommended unit	17
1	i have seen many other winders in the market with the same features but with much higher prices this winder is so quiet that i have no problem sleeping even with it on i highly recommend it	17
1	it exceeded my expectation it looks great and seems quite sturdy i bought for casual days when i am either skiing or just hanging out on a weekend i like it	17
1	i purchased these watches for my daughters birthday party and they were a big hit all the kids just loved them ! !	17
1	once i got the hang of it it worked like a charm i needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so i could see for perfect alignment if not perfectly aligned you break pins now that i got the hang of it i have one pin left i keep e maling seller to buy more pins but seller wo n't answer does anyone know where to get more pins \? i would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges	17
1	i have several fossil watches and every time i needed to adjust the band it cost me around 10 15 i found this tool and figured it was worth a try i was able to remove links from 2 of my fossil watches though my newest fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool i even used it to adjust watches for 2 of my friends it worked well made the adjustments and they were very happy with it ! they plan to buy it for themselves ! you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin but beyond that it works like a dream	17
1	wind the pin in ever so slowly and watch if you are n't going into the hole the smallest inaccuracy can cause the pin to bend i straighted mine out and go the pin hole next try and it worked a dream also good lighting is a must	17
1	use care when you use it as it can be easy to break pins but it works just like it should and it 's easier and cheaper than going to a watch store	17
1	small illustrated manual makes it easy to figure out how to use with a steady hand and some patience i was able to re size a couple of my watches it was really handy	17
1	i got this yesterday from my boyfriend and i love it it 's very pretty and i was extremely happy to unwrap it	17
1	i was expecting this watch to be a little more chunky than it is it is a little smaller than i pictured but it is a nice non flashy watch i have n't received any compliments on it after wearing it for a few weeks so if you are looking for a subtle but cute watch this is for you but if you want a watch that makes a statment and that people will notice i 'd look elsewhere	17
1	i love the jewel jet because it is exactly what my jeweler uses except now i can clean my diamond at home when i want it is easy to use just follow the directions	17
1	this is a great product if you have lots of jewelry this cleans everything perfectly no more harsh chemicals very fast and sufficient certainly worth the money	17
1	the steamer works very very well sure beats paying for or even just the hassle of taking your stuff to the jeweler and wondering if you got back what you took in great gadget	17
1	these are very comfortable earrings i even sleep in them the hoops go with everything and i very seldom wear other earrings now	17
1	these earrings are a good size but still very light it is a little tricky to learn how to fasten them but once hooked they stay safely closed all day the clasp sytem does not show once the earrings are on so this is a very clean and classic look i have long hair and the clasp does not tangle in my hair	17
1	i loved the earrings but unfortunatly one of them was faulty and had to send it back the package was lost in the transition but amazon gave me a full refund and was very helpful the earrings were beautiful and of good quality	17
1	a quality earring good size and very bright the are also very secure	17
1	i got this as agift in she likesd it very much	17
1	i had no trouble with and delay and the pendant looks great which was a gift for my sister and she loved it	17
1	this is a very nice piece i 've been looking for a key pendant for a while now but all the ones i 've seen have been very feminine and this one while slightly satanic fits nicely to the meaning i wanted without making me feel like a fairy princess shipping even got here early ! my only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller 4 5	17
1	i came in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected the person that received it loved it	17
1	i bought this to save for a christmas gift it is a very nice looking piece of jewelry	17
1	as other reviewers have stated this watch is large and it 's heavy i think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms the night light is cool and effective	17
1	perfect watch just as i expected lokks great both casual and semi formal	17
1	happy with the purchase the watch was what i expected casual enough to wear to work or for a night ou on the town	17
1	i wanted a basic watch that would be for everyday use and liked this timex design i was very pleased that it looked even nicer in person clear face leather band with slightly heavier stitching than some good weight \( not too heavy \) i have received a few compliments at work co workers were surprised at the value for the cost overall a solid timex offering that you will enjoy if you 're drawn to the style image that appears here in the product details	17
1	i really love this watch it looks so nice and elegant shipping is supper fast only 2 days ! great deal many thanks	17
1	i 've had this watch for about nine months now i wear it every day it keeps great time and looks great as well many people have complimented me on the design of this watch and asked me who made it the mesh band is the most comfortable and lightest band you will ever wear	17
1	love the earrings i have small earlobes and use these earrings in my second holes they are just perfect	17
1	the pliers do the job seem to be well made my only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link i guess if you remove the band from the watch it would make it easier in that case i recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface but this did do the job \( even leaving the band on the watch \) it comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out	17
1	this item far exceeds what i thought it would be i am very please	17
1	i first purchased this watch in 1994 when i entered the selection coarse to be an air force cct i lost the watch years later but i would occasionally try to find a replacement with no luck i now work for us doj and will be deployed to baghdad for a while and i need a watch i will be able to absolutely depend on in extreme conditions this is the only watch i will ever own i cannot say enough about it maybe i'm sentimental but i love this watch	17
1	i was so happy in receiving the watch so fast they do good business	17
1	my husband bought this for the 2nd time after losing the first it is nice for dressy or casual highly recommended	17
1	overall the watch is awesome i do actually use it when diving though it is only rated as water resistant and not waterproof i can say it holds up to at least 90 feet the dial is very readable at depth the digital display however is not the multifunction display has no backlight and at times can be hard to make out even on land the display does have luminescent hands and numbers that can be make out with no problem very comfortable and functional	17
1	after nearly two months my two automatic watches are ticking happily away the mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy the only critisism i have is lack of instructions to mount the watches maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band once i sorted that out no problem	17
1	the product as i recalled cost about 36 for a double winder the product works quite well and is reasonably quiet if one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money in the hundreds to thousands of dollars this product is in the tens of dollars and works very well i am very happy with the product as well as amazon \( dot \) com	17
1	owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months it is still running like clock work would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one	17
1	i recently received the item and i love it it is whisper quiet works in both directions and is automatic i have seen other winders at 5x this price that do n't do the same any of the winder would be a waste of money unless they sell a single winde	17
1	could not have gotten a better deal it has been working for the last 2 months very quite i leave it in the bedroom ca n't beat the price recommended for those automatic watch lovers you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model	17
1	the pendant was a little smaller than i expected but lovely nonetheless	17
1	although glass they do look like opals and have a lovely irridescent qualit	17
1	this is the second pair of earrings i got from silver insanity and i can tell you you wo n't be dissapointed they may be synthetic but no one will ever guess while you 're wearing them ! they catch the light beautifully and the delicate silver design compliments the gems perfectly i always get compliments when i wear these and you ca n't beat the price	17
1	fossil watches are beautiful and have a lot of style many people have pointed out at how different and nice my watch is it looks great with almost all of my casual clothes this is a beautiful high quality not so expensive watch	17
1	i bought this for my wife as christmas present she loves it	17
1	i bought one for my girl friend and she is very satisfied with it it is really beautiful	17
1	this is a must have watch for serious runners i have had mine for over a month and i love mine i am a professional track and field athlete and i train very hard to win races this watch helps me train better than any other watch i 've ever had it gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track not only that but it has 5 interval timers which you can set your appropriate rest time on if you are a serious runner like myself i highly suggest you get this watch it is definately something that you will need	17
1	i bought these earrings for my stepmother in seattle so i never actually saw them now she is a refined person with classy taste so you ca n't just get her any piece of junk she said they were perfect and she loved them that 's a great recommendation !	17
1	i have longed for gold hoop earrings for years these seemed liked they were the ones ! but i waited a while still debating finally 'went for it' and got a pair i have n't regretted it at all i find these earrings comfortable and i like the way they look on me i am very happy with these and recommend these beauties ! now if they would make them in white gold	17
1	nice watch for the price case is a little bigger than some but a nice watch with easy to read face	17
1	zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why i am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant the pendant itself is beautiful and the silver shines but the garnet is very small it is a nice red color though i purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three	17
1	i like guess watches spicily gold candy rock and white gold one is look like really gold	17
1	if you want a subtle piece of jewelry that will get attention this is it ! i have gotten more compliments and questions from strangers when i wear these \( earrings and pendant \) than i have from all the swarovski jewelry i have created and worn this is a very different color than i have ever worked with it appears as if two sides only are 2x ab and the other two are n't quite unusual which makes it fun	17
1	it was even more beautiful than what was shown in the display picture my friend absolutely loved it	17
1	absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry i bought it for a young man as a birthday gift and he has worn it every day since ! unique and eye catching	17
1	i bought two of these \( one for each daughter 3 6 \) it is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children thank you	17
1	this necklace is just as advertised i like it a lot i was looking for an almost choker necklace i would really like a wider one but this one will do	17
1	its beautiful but the heart look large in the picture but in realty it 's small but i think it 's better	17
1	i got this watch to help me with running walking and yoga it was a little difficult to figure out all of the set up but i am thrilled with the end result i recommend this product to any woman looking for a watch to use for multiple workout programs	17
1	thanks for the prompt delivery great packaging a beautiful watch sleek and chic perfect size for everyday wear and more active wear great features easy to use	17
1	great features on this watch i especially like the linked timers and the three alarms my wrist is tiny and the selection of holes is great \( i use the tightest \) this does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist and the extra band wraps all the way around but it does n't slip and it feels very comfortable the alarm sound is pleasant the color is great too	17
1	this pair of earrings is a great deal for the money you ca n't go wrong with a price like this	17
1	its tough to beat the price of these 1 2 ct diamonds for 199 they looked really good and the wife loved them the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they only have non screw backs and they did n't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got but for the price a minor quibble you wo n't be disappointed with your purchase	17
1	these are beautiful at a total 50 carat for the pair each 25 carat stud is well matched for color and clarity if you like white gold and diamonds you wo n't be disappointed	17
1	the watch is super thin you barely know you are wearing it in two weeks i have had over 10 compliments	17
1	this is my third skagen watch the design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light the design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear they have proven to be reliable timekeepers and i liked this one so much i bought two more for my sons at less than 80 00 each they are a real bargin	17
1	i 've had two skagen watches and have to say they are my favorite i love the large face and the titanium bracelet \( you do n't have to remove the watch in order to shower ! \) a lot of people have complimented me on the watch too given the price and quality you ca n't go wrong if you ever need a part replaced you just send it to skagen the work is completed in a couple of weeks ! in summary an elegant watch at a reasonable price	17
1	everyone loves this watch i wear it for work and it 's sleek enough to look sharp women constantly compliment me on how it looks	17
1	my roommate got this for his girlfriend and after examining his girlfriend 's ears i have decided that these earrings are great for the price not something you want to give your wife but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young \( or old \) girlfriend with an entry level nice gift they are a decent size and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance recommended	17
1	the stones are a beautiful color and they 're very pretty earrings packaged in a nice box i recommend these	17
1	i bought this pair to wear in my second ear piercing with a larger set of peridots in my first but i would also wear these alone the pair i received are a lovely color very recommended	17
1	i bought one as a gift it looks great on him but it ran out of battery after half a year and my friend need get it fixed this should not happend for a new watch as the watch was already started when i received it there was a possibility that it was n't brand new when i bought them other than that it is a good buy	17
1	because i teach i wear a man 's watch so i can keep my eye on the clock without seeming to look at my watch all the time this beauty has a very easy to read dial and it looks very cool and retro i 've gotten many compliments i should probably have the bracelet made smaller it 's one of the bigger sized men 's watches i 've ever worn so i think it would be a great choice for big guys i am quite pleased with my purchase the price was nice too	17
1	i 've found that i receive quite a few compliments whenever i wear this necklace great color combo not too heavy the price is right	17
1	this watch is generally a good watch but there are some flaws in ours not a surprise considering the price one there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning two my son has had the band come apart twice in one month the later probably a design issue relative to all the spring loaded retainers and such and the general range of movement of the clasp	17
1	this watch looks great although i was afraid that it was going to be bulky it has worked great for my husband the only problem we have had with it is setting the date on it no matter what time of day we set the date it is always the wrong date by the next day	17
1	this watch looks like business the movement is what i really like you get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping \( though i would n't call it sweeping \) i give it a 5 based on looks and cost i have n't had it long and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly \( it was losing a few hours at night \) i guess it just needed to get charged up it 's no rolex but it 's no casio either	17
1	the watch arrived in great condition it is a very stylish and affordable watch the only thing is that it is a tad too big and my boyfriends had to take some links out he has a big wrist so it was a little unusual nice watch though ! no regrets	17
1	pleased with this purchase surprised how nice the watch actually looks	17
1	this ring is just about what i expected it 's fun and puzzling and it looks nice i figured it out after about 20 minutes of messing with it \( i 've always been good with puzzles so it might take someone else longer \)	17
1	this ring is absolutely gorgeous and i havent taken it off since recieving it but when buying this ring be careful not to take the string off of the bands this string protects you from well insanity i unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands luckily i found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it my dad put it back together and it was fine but i have to admit i'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off if this does happen to you google puzzle ring solutions and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal	17
1	i love this ring ! it 's interesting to look at and i like the design i have n't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle maybe one day i might try it but i like it so much i do n't want to chance it now shipped fast	17
1	this is a fun item to own i spent 2 days trying to get it solid again and had to look up the solutionon the internet i think a solution should be included with the item	17
1	i loved the wiccan protection knot pendant i purchased it for my daughter for christmas and she has n't taked it off since she had wanted a celtic tricetta necklace but absolutely adored this one just as much thank you	17
1	i was very pleased when i recieved this i love that it does n't look like every single other pendant on the market and although it looks like it in the picture it 's not enormously huge just the right size and very pretty	17
1	i have been looking for a bracelet for what seems to be years never found the right style size design combination to fit until now this bracelet looks great on the wrist it is well constructed and very comfortable to wear with no pinching i'm giving it the full 5 stars without any hesitation	17
1	this bracelet looks better than the picture it looks beautiful on my wrist the fifty bucks that i paid for it was a real bargain i love it there 's only one drawback it 's 8 inches long and that 's too long for my wrist if it fit perfectly i 'd give it ten stars i 'll pay to make it smaller it 's made of titanium and maybe it 's too tough to alter i want it to fit over that knot on my wrist if i can get it altered i 'll wear it until the day i die which i hope will be 100 years from now	17
1	i got this bracelet for my boyfriend initially i was looking at two different designs but i'm really interested with this one i made up my mind to buy this bracelet when i received it i'm vary satisfied with it it 's really nice and the good thing is my boyfriend really like it it 's a worth buy	17
1	as a gift this bracelet will not disappoint it appears just \( or better \) as it does in the picture the only downside is that for a gentlemen with a thicker bone structure there will not be any give nor do they provide extra links to make it a bit more comfortable otherwise one cannot go wrong with selecting it	17
1	i always wanted a titanium braclet and i found this on of all places amazon com i thought why not \? i was very surprised when i got it this bracelet looks better in person ! very high quality the pic dont do it justice its a elegant design very contemporary and classy it does not look gawdy or bling bling tacky treat yourself and pick this one up	17
1	it is like a rolex daytona a very nice watch but with some difficulty to read because of it dial color	17
1	beautiful watch ! ! i was already familiar with invicta and know that they 're worth three times the price and that in the future they will be had it in just a few days do n't let the picture fool you it does not do this piece justice and you would be better off going to another site to view what this watch actually looks like looks like it cost a whole lot more i 've been watching invicta 's for about a year now and if you find a better price than this it 's stolen ! ! !	17
1	this color was on a price special and i liked the look in the picture so i chose this model i found that the silver on silver makes it a bit more difficult to read than i would have liked but it 's adequate good accurate movement as the other invicta timepieces i 've owned or known of have also been this one is quite heavy and has a feel of a more pricey timepiece mine is running about 3 seconds slow per week which does n't seem bad but former invictas i 've had were a bit better than this update to prior review now that the watch has limbered up the accuracy has improved and i 've hardly needed to touch it	17
1	i had one exactly like this one for over 20 years but finally the crown fell off i am keeping it for a backup as it is still running just fine i expect the same quality of my new seiko i highly recommend this model easy to read dial \( especially the white face \) and also a fine looking piece of jewelry	17
1	extremely reliable easy to read looks like the rolex style only it is very lightweight good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch i would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery	17
1	this item was very nice the chain was longer than i expected and hangs really low on my neck but it only looks like the real one you can tell that it is a knock off but you get what you pay for for 5 i think that it was worth it but it does look different than the real one good service and delivery	17
1	this was a gift for my brother and he really enjoyed it it was shipped quickly which is always a plus	17
1	this invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems all metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly and the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion \( hard to read in direct light \) also who needs a 24h dial on a chronograph \( instead of a 1 10s dial \) \? but overall for this price a good deal and good looking	17
1	this watch is very attractive and keeps great time it seems to be very high quality and i like all the engraving	17
1	this watch is attractive fairly heavy and well made \( esp for the price \) one small complaint is that the glow in the dark hands barely show up 4 1 2 stars	17
1	seller was delivering immediately the watch itself is sporty but elegant suited for active men	17
1	this is a beautiful piece of solid silver jewelry well constructed and spins without burrs or sticking points it is very pretty and a wonderful addition to my wardrobe a lovely pendant that i will treasure always	17
1	it was a gift and i was pleased with the good quality and workmanship	17
1	great color and very well made while small for a primary pierce in the lobe they are the perfect size for my second pierce this company also makes beautiful 1 2 hoop earrings set with amethyst that i'm very happy with	17
1	the earrings arrived in a jewelery box so they would make a nice gift the earrings seem to be well made the post has a notch to prevent loss of the back the ameythyst stone is so pretty i 've gotten a number of compliments on these earrings	17
1	the watch arrived promptly and was exactly what i expected a very nice everyday watch for a good price	17
1	i have been wearing this watch for last 6 months no complaints loved the adjust o matic bracelet great buy	17
1	i bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for christmas the girls wear them all the time they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them	17
1	the bracelets were as advertised shipping was reasonably prompt the only thing that i am slightly worried about is whether the elastic band which holds the pearls is strong enough to last for some time these were not intended for me i bought them as a gift for my mother and i can only comment on its longevity only after she 's used them for some time	17
1	obviously the pearls are flawed but because of their size you ca n't tell even from a short distance away they 're super cute but i suggest getting them 2 or 3 at a time as they look a bit awkward on their own	17
1	i ordered one each for my 5 year old daughter and her 2 friends for valentine 's day nice pearl color and oval like shapes slightly too big for a 5 year old but would be good for older children or a small wristed adult very dainty a great buy for the price	17
1	i will buy more items from you guys i got them quikl	17
1	i bought these pearls for my granddaughter when she was born in june i bought my 2 year old granddaughter pearls and wanted my 2nd one to have pearls too the pearls i purchased were exactly what i wanted	17
1	i have n't worn pierced earrings in years i thought they were sealed when i discovered that they were indeed open i sought some simple gold post types to wear when i saw my march birthstone set in a simple gold setting i could n't resist it the actual earring is so elegant ! 'tis exactly as described and more ! wearing such graceful simplicity in my beauty starved lobes makes me feel like royalty ! and for such a small price with the security of amazon ! what a joy ! sincerely miss agnes crosb	17
1	inexpensive aquamarine is usually a washed out blue color not these babies ! you 'll fool your friends into thinking you 've spent double	17
1	this watch is definitely something that i will keep with me for a while it is simple elegant and came to me for relatively cheap the free shipping is always a bonus and i also came across it in the gold box deals and when i saw it i knew i had to have it it is pink and is lighter pink in the center the bracelet was large with the extra links so i removed them and took it to the store to make it smaller i think its a great watch for both casual and more formal settings	17
1	great watch bought through amzon usa 10 days from order to receipt with shipping tracking along the way if you get nervous aussie price au 890 amazon price au 510 do yourself a deal buy wht you ca n't afford in aussie through amazon	17
1	watch is the best on the market i've had it a month now and love it the compliments keep coming in and amazon's price was the lowest i could find anywhere both on the net and at the discount stores if you want to cath the ladies eyes this is the watch for you	17
1	my husband loves this watch he was so excited that it looks even better in person than the picture as soon as he shook it the watch did exactly what it was suppose to and set itself to the right time date and month he 's absolutely thrilled with it and i was thrilled with the price from this company thanks all around	17
1	this watch is beautiful the picture do n't make any justice the quality from amazon is flawless highly recommended	17
1	i have enjoyed the oregon series watch it is good looking the band is comfortable and is holding up nicely the display is easy to read and the light is quite good my one complaint is that the chronograph is often difficult to clear i run a good bit and i was doing a workout the other day i had to keep holding down the clear button to get the old time off other than that i have enjoyed the watch immensely i thought the price was extremely reasonable as well	17
1	everything was ok i actually recommend	17
1	it 's got an alarm stop watch timer lap timer 5 alarms actually a water break alarm water resistant although do n't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine and when it gets hot outside water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time but other than that it 's a great watch finest i 've owned in terms of digital watch i highly recommend it	17
1	i bought this watch for my son a marine serving in iraq because he requested a sturdy digital with an alarm this one had a large face which he says is extremely easy to read in any light especially at night it is comfortable and sits close to the wrist with very little profile he loves it and asked me to order a second one because he wants a back up !	17
1	if you are looking for an inexpensive yet reliable accurate stylish analog \( rather than digital \) timepiece this is the watch for you easy to set up comfortable to wear no backlight so hard to read in low light a good buy	17
1	i like this watch as it was pretty cheap and it keeps good time right with wwv time clock for the last couple of months since i got it i am extremely hard on watches the crystal is not hard so it is scratched already the time is very accurate with the colorado wwv time station for 30 bucks or so except for the scratched face is the only issue worth the mone	17
1	this was a pleasant surprise for the money and the craftsmanship is quite good only criticism is the adjustment of the band is a bit tedious it is certainly worth while and a durable product i would certainly buy this product again	17
1	i am completely satisfied with this product correct time is kept and it has been a great watch i have had many atomic wrist watches and this is the best one ever	17
1	this watch is totally accurate and with glow in the dark hands and numerals and an oversized date window it is the perfect watch it makes it a pleasure to look at my wrist	17
1	my last ironman lasted 12 years of very hard usage in the restaurant business lots of heat grease and water ! my new timex combo dual tech watch has all the same features especially the timers which i can set at different intervals you ca n't beat the price for this rugged but sleak looking watch a plus it has both digital time and good old watch hands	17
1	this watch met all my requirements and it well suited for my hand i liked the feature of turning the digital display on off the strap is also smooth doest hurt ur skin the only negative remark i found with this watch is the indiglo night light is not that bright as i expected or was not equivalent to my previous watch	17
1	i 've had the watch for about 3 weeks and i really like it better than i expected	17
1	this watch is great it has full iron man functionality and actually looks nicer than a geeky casio unlike prior iron man watches i probably should have gone with the steel band as it could be worn out as well it has solid construction and easy functionality the indiglo could be a little brighter but i am sure that would cost battery life	17
1	the quality of the product is great and was just as advertised the delivery time was excellent as it was promised for a week delivery but arrived the next day ! great company to do business with	17
1	my daughter loves this earring 'tree' it looks great and is very practical as it holds multiple earrings	17
1	this is a big watch for the price ! \( 44mm i believe \) you have to buy a vintage dive watch to find one this large i agree with the other reviewer about the strap i lost a casio just like this before the beach i now have a waterborne dive strap on my new one a one directional bezel a screw down crown would be nice on future models also be ready to be asked what time is it \? a lot when you wear it to the beach \)	17
1	this model has been out for a long time i like the look of the black more then the white or gold the reason the watch loses one star is because the band it looks great but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year the replacement band that casio offers looks close the orginal but not exactly the same i lost one of these and another was stolen so the fact that i am on my third is a statement to how much i love this watch i have been wearing it since about 1993	17
1	when i received this item i could not believe how beautiful it was the price was insane for the quality and workmanship i will order more for my sisters	17
1	i bought this necklace for my 5 year old granddaughter the piece is beautiful and has some weight to it its very well made and no one would guess the price i paid more than worth the price	17
1	these are so pretty i 'd like to have a whole box of them just to look at originally coolstyles mis shipped my order but acted quickly to make sure that i got my shipment by christmas i was very pleased with that	17
1	these earrings are very pretty not too big not too small just right for the price you ca n't go wrong the gift box they arrived in was sort of cheesy but they were for me so i did n't mind if i were giving them as a gift i 'd put them in a prettier box before giving them to the recipient overall very pretty earrings good value no complaints	17
1	i bought these and made a set with a necklace for my girl they look gorgeous on her really really worth the effort and unique i highly recommend this seller the reward i got for the gift well let 's just say i'm buying stuff from them in the future for sure !	17
1	the earrings are gorgeous kind of a hematite color but they look darker nearly black against fair skin beautiful ! and this company ! the earrings went on sale after i ordered \( and paid for \) them and they automatically credited my card account for the difference wow ! i am very happy with this purchase and will definitely buy from securehoop again	17
1	i got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much my only complaint is that my wrists are super small and i had to get links removed but that was no big deal i only wear it when i need to dress up so it 's still in good shape	17
1	these small earrings are great ! i can sleep in them and because they are platinum i do not have any allergic reaction to the metal ! i'm so glad i found them	17
1	i received these earrings as a christmas gift from my sister they are perfect their size is about the circumference of a dime platinum adds elegance and yet they are perfect for simple everyday wear you know they will never tarnish nor will they irritate your ears they are also perfect for young lady 's first introduction to platinum jewelry	17
1	this is a really nice little pendant necklace the stones are not too small not too big the pendant is about 1 long the bail is large enough to accommodate a nice chain \( it comes with an 18 fine chain but you might want to replace it with something a bit more substantial \) for the price i was expecting something a lot cheaper looking i was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this	17
1	i had a previous expedition watch that lasted many years and served me well i purchased this new version and so far have n't been disappointed if you 're looking for a basic watch that tells time and has a backlight i do n't think you can go wrong for the money	17
1	i purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers i found that it is effective to show many of my pieces and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional very professional looking and easy to carry around if you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled but i do n't believe it is intended for that purpose	17
1	i gave this watch to my fiance as a gift and she loved it ca n't lose with this one	17
1	love my new watch ! it is very thin and comfortable i get compliments every time i wear it	17
1	beautiful clean simple lightweight lovely watch great price and look perfect size and really durable got it for christmas and have n't taken it off since	17
1	i love this watch ! it matches everything ! ! and i love the little diamonds that mark the numbers that circle the watch ! ! so nice	17
1	the item ordered was shipped promptly and was exactly as described no problems whatsoever	17
1	this is a beautiful classic piece my husband got mucho brownie points for this one a good choice for anyone you want to show your love to	17
1	the pendant is gorgeous and feels substantial quick delivery and the product was delivered as promised the chain is a little long \( for me \) so the pendant hangs at about breastbone level but it 's so lovely i have n't bothered to find a new chain	17
1	i love this watch it was my christmas present to myself the ribbons are easy to interchange and i wear them with the silver bracelet as well it comes in a cute and durable box that i now use to store all of my watches a perfect gift and good quality i especially like the little heart on the minute sweep	17
1	this is the first time i settled for byzantine style of jewelry but i like it it is a big and shining bracelet that perfectly matches with dark or black clothes it would make an excellent gift for a man especially if the guy is not skinny	17
1	i went onto ebay and found the same product for slightly less but the shipping was outrageous ! great product clockwise or counter clockwise rotation i have it in my office on the back of my desk and i can barely hear it working if i pay attention to it nice design and looks good	17
1	i purchased this watch winder as part of my husband 's christmas gifts this year to pair with his new tag heuer carrera i compared this winder to many others out there in all price ranges and this one is actually the same winder many luxury stores \( ie neiman marcus \) carry sans branding it 's very quiet and the interval winding keeps his watches running without risking over winding you can save a lot of money by forgoing the leather wrapping or wood veneer packaging on the more expensive winders and just get this one	17
1	this dual watch winder is awesome not only is it ultra stylish but it works great although i have expensive tastes when it comes to watches i cannot justify paying more than 100 for a watch winder that no one will ever see this dual watch winder works great with my tag heuer link and my movado it 's truly a great buy no reason to spend more money	17
1	i purchased this with a gift certificate for myself for the price you can not complain too much this necklace is a nice addition to my jewlery box i suppose the more expensive ones may sparkle a bit more but this is a nice piece	17
1	i purchased this necklace as a christmas gift for my sister the pendant is very nice indeed but the chain is poor quality and seems like it will break easily with a replacement chain the necklace turned out very beautiful though	17
1	i love the watch expecially with the black white color looks the casio of the old with a modern twist the watch is very basic in design a dual digital fully funtional chronograpgh watch one other thing it is very easy to set the only problem is it is not back lit so the digital part of the watch is useless at night \( if incase you happen to be doing something in the dark at night \) this is the only disappointing fact about the wrist watch you might think a watch that cost 60 will have a self supplied light but it does not sad shame on casio apart from that i love the watch	17
1	i have bought this watch for him every 6 years he has owned three so far after replacing the battery it is not as water resistant also the band has broken on two out of the three of the watches i gave it 4 stars because of the degradable band no other watch has movable bezel analog and digital time with an alarm for under 100 00	17
1	my wife brought me this watch as a christmas gift i could not be more pleased nice big face and rugged decent quality i may just get the gold or black version next	17
1	this is a nice watch and give accurate time i gave only 4 stars because it took me a hard time to pull the crown to adjust the time	17
1	lightweight great price self adjustable this was the perfect gold toned watch for me ! i shopped around and amazon had the best price for this watch	17
1	it 's a beautiful simple elegant watch been eyeing it for a year never have seen it at such a fantastic price job well done	17
1	your service products and suppliers are the best ! ! excellent service excellent products and peace of mind when ordering thank you amazon you 're the best !	17
1	this is a great looking watch it is handsome and elegant the face is large and easily viewed the style is easily those you see in 1000 watches but obviously does not have the engineering of the more upscale models a real bargain for such a handsome watch	17
1	i am very pleased with this product and have had numerous positive comments about how sharp the timepiece looks the dial is much larger than most watches but i have big wrists so it was perfect the size also gives an updated look the only negative comment i have is that the watch is pretty thick and binds on shirt cuffs but that is a minimal problem great reproduction watch	17
1	this pendant is small about the size of a dime and very light it is one sided the opposite side is hollow it appears exactly as shown the chain it comes with is 18 which is pretty standard and has a circular clasp with the knob you have to pull on	17
1	shpping items like these to an african country will always be scary but it arrived in very good condition nothing was damaged and the chain and little black pouch was well picked it was a surprise pendant for my girlfriend she expected just one item but this moon was well priced so i bought it with another pendant you are lucky to get such beautifully crafted art at this price it is strong so no need to worry about breakage during shiping i like it and wish i could keep it but it was a gift	17
1	i was surprised at the quality the bracelet and necklace matched perfectly it was a great gift for my 23 year old daughter she loved them	17
1	my wife was surely surprised when she rec 'd this gift now that she is in a retail lsdies shop to dress up and add pearls looks fantastic thanks well worth the price	17
1	very beautiful pearls there are visible blemishes which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed the uniformity is very good all pearls are more or less same size beautiful clasps too however i have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help especially the bracelet took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist the color is slightly yellowish the shape is good kinda semiround rather than potato they 'll make great gifts	17
1	the set is absolutely gorgeous in person and i'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster the clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design and it 's incredibly secure when fastened however it 's difficult to maneuver and i ca n't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on or get it off without assistance that 's the only reason i would n't give this five stars the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great	17
1	my husband loved it great watch for a great price does everything he wanted	17
1	i needed a basic watch for time and running and this fits both well	17
1	i purchased this watch expecting an inexpesive one which i got but i recieved more than that it was cheap in price but definately not cheap in quality my watch has held up to drenching rains and with stood the water resistant up to 50 00 meters label with ease very comfortable easy to reset and has all the bells and whistles i love it ! !	17
1	i love this item ! i bought one for each of my bridesmaids as their gift from me these jewelry rolls are beautiful and appear to be very useful in holding jewelry there 's even a place to hold your rings \)	17
1	i ordered for my grand daughters xmas present and she loves them mission accomplished ! ! !	17
1	i have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son 's care giver when it arrived my sisters and i were tempted to keep them for ourselves they were lovely i particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet they are what i would term fun pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only i am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces it was a good buy at the sale price oddly enough i also liked the packaging the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little gift boxes on the inside	17
1	i was very pleased with the service of this seller the earrings came within a few days and i love them i have been asked more than once where i got them thanks	17
1	i like everything about this watch except the hands are hard to read in dim light because of the yellow background	17
1	my husband is very picky he loves this watch he has gone through a lot of them and loves that it 's dressy yet casual and can wear it anywhere he loves that it 's a substantial weight and the bracelet came extra long he 's 6'2 and large boned had a watch repair shop take a couple links out for only 5 great investment	17
1	i was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic considering the price i was so very wrong ! the necklace is gorgeous ! the clasp is sturdy and not easy broke package it was mailed in was also very good i am able to christmas wrap it in the package provided excellent service thank you ! !	17
1	this is my second one of these winders so obviously i'm a fan winds my rolexes and a few other eta autos perfectly but it does n't seem to keep my seiko kinetic diver or panerais wound sufficiently still as far as i'm concerned it spreads the lubrication enough to keep the watches in good health for the price point this winder cannot be beat and i will purchase more in the future the auto timer keeps the winder running cool fairly silent rotation depending on the watch while the gear rotations themselves are completely silent sometimes there 's a slight shift of the watch as it goes around which makes a repetitive sound nothing i ca n't live with highly recommended	17
1	i bought this watch and it is cute but the face is smaller than the picture makes it look luckily it was for my teenage daughter and not for me cute though	17
1	this watch is a great looking watch and the indigo light gives it all it needs to meet your everyday use because of its gold tone and silver tone band you do n't have to worry about what color jewelry you wear with it because it matches it all well worth the price	17
1	hasta este momento ha sido una experiencia muy favorable pues el reloj ha funcionado perfectamente y el tiempo de entrega estuvo dentro de mis expectativas	17
1	i wanted a watch with a metal band and a large analog dial i was n't quite sure that i would like this watch when it arrived it was a women 's style but it was larger than i thought it would be i had to first take it to have some of the links removed but i was amazed at how light it was when i had it on i love the easy to read face and the indigo feature is a must for any watch you own i wear it everyday and i love it it arrived with a brand new battery and the stem was pulled out so you knew the battery was new i recommend this watch	17
1	i am delighted to get my new timex watch it is even prettier than its picture ! it is easy to set too i bought this watch for its looks and the larger dial so i am very satisfied it will need links removed but one size just does n't ever fit all	17
1	i really like my new timex it is very classy looking and the face is very easy to read i like the date feature and the lighted face in the dark the only drawback was i had to take it to my jeweler to have some links removed but the charge was minimal all in all good value for the price	17
1	i work in construction and am constantly having to replace my watches because of damage this watch is great because it is sturdy and can be clipped out of the way to prevent breakage	17
1	this is a really nice looking watch keeps accurate time would recommend to anyone considering did a lot of research and amazon had the best price with free shipping	17
1	my trusty seiko of 21 years gave out recently \( i should really remember to take it off when doing strenuous labor \) and i went in search of a similar style i received this replacement about a week ago and i love it already it 's light weight and easy to read in the light or dark	17
1	thanks ! i don't have any problem ! i ll continue make deal with you	17
1	great price super nice watch	17
1	the diamonds are real sparklers they are simple for daytime wear and sophisticated enough for a night on the town a good value !	17
1	these earrings are a gift for the upcoming holidays i think the person receiving them will really like them they are a great color and are a nice size i would totally recommend these	17
1	this is a very good looking watch it goes with dressy or casual and it makes you feel well dressed	17
1	this watch was purchased as a gift and i was pleasantly surprised when i received it the quality is excellent i had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky but i found it to be in line with watches of the same type this watch works well with casual and work attire and i was tempted to keep the watch for myself in fact i regret not purchasing one for me to keep buy with confidence	17
1	i got a really good deal for this watch and it looks great too very classy	17
1	no complaints it 's a nice change from a more feminine type of watch i usually prefer very nicely priced at amazon	17
1	i received this off my wish list from a dear friend and i must say it 's stunning it 's both delicate and sturdy the craftsman 's shift is beautiful in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount the stone is beautiful and large without being gaudy it 's a stunning piece of work all you lads out there should buy this for you lass and make her very happy ! wonderful piece i highly recommend for quality and price	17
1	there isnt much i can say about this item just that the picuture doesnt do the item justice and the seller was great to deal with easy transaction and no problems	17
1	this is a very nice ring i bought one for a gift and decided to keep it myself and ordered anothe	17
1	very nice quality and reasonable pricing this is a great place to see a variety of jewelry my college age daughter fell in love with the bracelets instantly	17
1	just recieved mine today ! its very beautiful it is a weighty ring though and the moonstone is a but smaller than i thought it would be but all in all it is a great buy	17
1	i bought these earrings as a birthday present they are very pretty i am pleased with the quality and the price	17
1	it 's hard to tell the size of these earrings from the pictures however they were about 2x the size that i expected i could n't have found a better gift than these	17
1	i bought these earrings for my niece and after they arrived i immediately ordered another pair for myself i find them actually nicer in reality than in the picture the size is perfect and the amethysts although very small add just a little color accent i bought them on sale for 15 instead of the usual 50 and i am very very pleased with what i got for the price	17
1	nice watch very simple hands are very luminous like the magnified date window	17
1	there 's nothing bad i can say about this item it is by far the lowest price i 've seen for something of this quality and hey she loved it	17
1	they are small but sparkly and look very cute my 15 year old loves it and wear it every day	17
1	prompt delivery good quality well worth the price actually just the right size for all occasions many complements on them thank you kathi abbot	17
1	she 's out of state taking care of her cranky parents \( mom damaged a hip dad is helpless when these things happen \) and needed something to boost her spirits she loved it she prefers small jewelry so it was perfect for her	17
1	i use this watch both as a daily timepiece and for timing my runs the ability to turn off the digital display gives it a refined look even for an ironman series i like the catch incorporated into the watch band so it does n't pull out of the guide \( something that used to drive me crazy with my other watches \) if you 're looking for a sports watch that you can wear out on the town this fits the bill	17
1	timex ironman has been my kind of watch for long time now great watch to wear anytime	17
1	i found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear they look much better than the ones found in macy 's fine jewelry and they cost less personally i would not go over 1 3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious i am very satisfied with my purchase	17
1	i love it very nice watch ! a little bit heavy but this is the way i like watches and the price is not that bad	17
1	this is one of the best watches available and i have no regrets whatsoever with my purchase at a real bargain price from amazon	17
1	tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis the times change and we change with them this is a perfect watch and probably you wo n't change your time machine for a long time simple and beautifu	17
1	it is a good watch under 200 price range if you buy it you will love it forever one thing i hate is little bit heavy but not a big deal \)	17
1	my husband has really liked this watch so far the price was great for such a elegant looking watch he wears it when he dresses up he really likes that it is kinetic we do n't have to worry about replacing the battery the last watch i bought him was a fossil and we had to send it to their servicing center when the battery died and had to wait 4 6 weeks the kinetic seems to be working out great	17
1	this is a sleek sharp quality watch and the lowest priced model that i 've seen in the arctura series if you can catch it on sale i think its a great buy however be prepared for the weight this is the heaviest watch i 've ever worn and probably the largest if you 're used to wearing stainless watches it will probably be fine for you i'm used to leather bands and the weight difference is quite noticeable wish i could find this watch in titanium that would be perfect overall if you 're not bothered by the large size or weight it looks great and i'm sure the quality is also	17
1	i really like the watch it looks good feels good on my wrist and keeps extremely accurate time \( gains about 4 sec per month \) the price of at amazon com was very good compared to others i found in local stores or on the web	17
1	the picture does not do this watch justice it is a very sturdy watch with a nice looking all silver body and band it does not look cheap at all !	17
1	my husband just loves this watch and ca n't get over the great quality for the price	17
1	item came to me fast it is very confortable and very reliable i do n't have to worry a regular chain sticking in my neck or pulling my hair when the necklace moves i highly recommend this necklace for sensitive skins or active people	17
1	i like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it and it looks good the only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it	17
1	i love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective i contacted sabrina and they were great about sending me a new one asap with a label for returning the other one that was impressive and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued still the clasp is a product defect and i'm sure one of these days i will probably loose the bracelet b c it comes undone unknowingly	17
1	great set of earrings at a very nice price thanks	17
1	these earrings are so cute ! they are a great size for a toddler but probably a little large for a small infant it is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute these are a beautiful rose pink color very sweet	17
1	my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable	17
1	i rounded up from a 4 5 the shipping was on time it was within the specification advertised but one of the diamonds is much more yellow than the others even without a hand lense it is visible other than that i am very happy with the service and product thank you jason bett	17
1	great value and excellent quality better than anything that i 've seen locally highly recommend	17
1	we love the watch it 's totally adjustable press the button for glow in the dark feature the two lizards chase each other around the watch too cute	17
1	i bought this watch for my husband for his bday it was a great bargain very stylish and he loves it the only problem we encountered was w the so called smart link band it was supposedly designed for the customer to resize the band at home but after numerous failed attempts we gave up we googled it and found several people who encountered similar problems solving the smart link mystery but no one offered a solution even the fossil website was no help we ended up paying a jeweler who sells fossil watches 10 to resize the band other than that my husband is very satisfied with this watch	17
1	i bought this for my husband he likes the large easy to read numbers and says the expandable band is comfortable a very nice watch at a reasonable price	17
1	bought this watch as a gift i was not disapointed another great vaule from amazo	17
1	i am pleased with this watch it is inexpensive yet has a lot of features the only negative is that the band is a cloth material and not as easy to keep clean as it would with a leather band	17
1	i read the reviews for these earrings and i am very pleased with the results i purchased my own pair and get plenty of compliments too	17
1	really great quality for the price the hinges are well made so i do n't worry about them falling apart when i wear them they are not white gold and diamonds they are what they claim to be silver and cz i like them !	17
1	as i said in my review of the bracelet \( which i bought together \) i thought from the pictures that they might be bigger however my wife was pleasantly surprised they look much more expensive than they are this is my first experience with cz but not my last \( we 're remodling a house \) i recommend this seller for their shipping quality of merchandise	17
1	i bought this pair of earrings for myself over a year ago when they were new to amazon \( no reviews \) i wanted something that looked pretty but did n't cost me a lot i loved them loved them so much that when i lost one down my sink drain i wanted to buy another pair i am currently waiting to receive my second pair for the price and the beauty why not ! no one will know they are n't real diamonds	17
1	i got this as a present after putting it on my wish list i love it it is really delicate and pretty it 's a little smaller than i thought it would be but still one of my favorite pieces of jewelry	17
1	saw the exact same watch in several jewelry case around town for 125 more very satisfied with my purchase	17
1	i purchased this watch on amazon after looking at the same watch in jc penny and dillards for almost 200 00 more it 's a nice casual watch i wear mine to work as a nurse and its very durable and attractive the mother of pearl face is a pale pink so it does n't clash when wearing other colors for the price seiko watches are great mine usually last about 10 years of frequent wear getting wet regularly	17
1	after a good deal of shopping both online and in retail stores we are delighted with the product price and service through amazon com i recomend this watch highly	17
1	received the watch on saturday dec 23 which was ordered thursday dec 21 in the late evening the watch is beautiful thank you for the great service	17
1	i love this watch it keeps wonderful time i have a bigger wrist so i am glad it has a latch so it wo n't fall off	17
1	for the price it is well made and solid perfect for my kids	17
1	i m very happy to buy in amazon shipping was perfect and on time	17
1	this watch is exactly what i was looking for it is a small pretty functional watch that is quite durable it has plenty of features but is not extremely complicated the color is slightly lighter and more purpley then it is in the pictures	17
1	the watch arrived in timely fashion and was already set up this watch is super however it lacks a timer i left the timex ironman for this watch timex 's quality is horrid \( a watch per year \) and i changed to the casion g shock based on a recommendation of a friend i am glad i did if they ever get a timer in this watch i 'd buy another	17
1	this watch arrived very quickly and it is a very fine watch i had an earlier casio ceptor watch and the battery died i could n't find anyone to replace it so i needed a new watch by the time i had ordered this watch i actually replaced the battery myself in the old one so now i have two atomic watches but the g shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge a great deal	17
1	i purchased this watch as a christmas gift for my husband he was quite surprised and pleased by the atomic solar features and replaceable watch band the watch is a little bulky and fits a bit tight under his sleeves on his dress work shirts overall very pleased and a great value	17
1	i bought this as a gift for a friend and it was the perfect combination of brown leather for casual dress as well as the beautiful simplicity of silver to match classier wear whether you 're looking for something casual or more formal this bracelet wraps it all into one	17
1	i never had a problem with mine i'm a marine and the fact that i went trough combat with mine and held up made it worth the few bucks i paid for it i go trough watches like they are made of paper had this one for 2 5 yrs and other than a lot of scratches it works fine	17
1	i'm logged in on my wife 's accont i never had problems with the band i liked the first one so much that after i ran over it with my car i ordered another if you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years you 'll love it it has a very intuitive design is lightweight and just works	17
1	i bought this watch to replace an older similar model it is simple and functional perfect for being both a timepiece and a running watch the functions are easy to use and the indiglo feature is crucial for nighttime training	17
1	this is my second sleek 50 the first was fine until the battery died then i tried to put in a new battery \( bad idea \) and managed to mess up some of the inner workings highly recommended \( the watch not changing the battery !	17
1	i have three holes in each ear and i really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes these are wonderful ! they are small but exactly what i wanted such a great buy for this price	17
1	i went out on a limb and decided to surprise my wife with these for valentine 's day i purchased the white gold version for her and to my great astonishment my wife was pleased by my jewelry choice a first ! they come in a smallish box with a smaller felt bag that holds the tiny earings \( the picture in amazon must be under a micron microscope ! \) they are tasteful and understated	17
1	i love love these earrings i bought them because i wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time unless there is something special then i will change for a special occasion but these earrings i wear in the shower they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold i received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date	17
1	the earrings delivered were as described and will certainly work for me i was a bit disappointed in the strength and flexibility of the gold wire these earrings were much more flexible that the 25 year old pair i was replacing i doubt that the new ones are as strong and will hold up as well however they do what i need them to do and can be worn around the clock without irritation	17
1	excellent watch \( eco drive \) i would spend the extra hundred and purchase the titanium	17
1	this is my fourth \( a fifth limited edition is on order \) eco drive i collect a lot of watches but these are some of my favs to actually wear and use they are the most accurate watches i 've ever owned bar none the nighthawk is solid well made and a delight to wear there are few watches on which i 'd change nothing but this is one i also got an excellent price and great service many thanks	17
1	threaders are in and these are about the most elegant looking threaders i 've seen the stones are a nice size and it is obvious that it is a butterfly it is nice to have such a refined option for such a hip style	17
1	i bought these for a friend for christmas as she is a butterfly lover they ar beautiful dainty yet elegant she loved them it was hard for me to give them up	17
1	the earings look much better than pictured online i received this as a gift and love them	17
1	it is small and beautifull be sure you want a small one	17
1	this watch is gorgeus it 's a very big watch \( it does n't look so big on the picture \) the screen can be set to black or red looks good either way very confortable	17
1	this watch changes the background color from red to black is great and the leather belt is soft but resisitance	17
1	this is a gorgeous and delicate looking watch i can read it without my glasses and so far it works i 've had trouble with timex in the past so i hope this holds up well it is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening	17
1	classic style and leather too ! the perfect little black watch at the perfect price	17
1	i always wear timex and never have a problem	17
1	this watch looks so sleek it wears well with day evening wear in addition it makes a great travel watch i love the feel of the nice soft leather band	17
1	i chose this watch because of the stunning and currently very fashionable 'rolex green' colour and because the price was right so how does it stack up \? nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces the quality and finish are excellent and the watch is easy to set for day and date it has a clear back so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work pretty cool clasp and strap are well finished and work well rotating bezel lines up perfectly at 12 o'clock nice sweeping hand movement great look and great value	17
1	i love this watch and i love the price it looks good both casual and dressy it goes with just about anything the people at invicta are really right in that you should try to match your watch with your belt and such the material is high quality i have large wrists so it 's tricky to get on and off initially because the leather is quite stiff but it 's been loosening and so it 's much easier now	17
1	i very much like these earrings my only reason for not giving them a 5 star rating is that the topaz is quite small you really have to look closely to see it but they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful i recommend them just be aware that the stones are tiny	17
1	my boyfriend got me this watch for valentine 's day and it is gorgeous ! the face is very small as other reviewers have indicated so if the recipient likes smaller face watches \( as i do \) this is a great gift it looks more like a bracelet than a watch good for small wrists elegant looking classy i love it !	17
1	this is a tiny compact watch with elegant design it is fit for the women attending the formal parties plus it works great this price deserves its value	17
1	this is a very nice watch it is smaller than it looks in the picture but i actually like it better that way it is delicate and lady like the pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished it makes a nice dressy or everyday watch i have seen similar seikos in the stores for much more money	17
1	bought these as a christmas gift and think think they are adorable ! great for a second or third hole to add a splash of color possibly perfect for a young daughter 's first hole the stones have a very nice sparkle was n't sure if 3mm would be too small but i think these will do just fine this set came individually boxed but in a clear plastic holder so that you can easily give as a set or break them up for individual wrapping for 49 i'm very satisfied	17
1	i am very pleased with the locket it is a nice size but not too big definitely large enough to be engraved the chain is pretty and appears to be strong it arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box my daughter was delighted with it	17
1	someone near and dear to me loved it and the price was right ! valentine 's day is coming it makes a great gift	17
1	i bought this necklace after reading reviews about different types breaking easily this one is very good so far and my wife loves it for the price i paid it is a great product	17
1	this necklace is beautiful the chain is not skimpy and the heart locket itself is really pretty a great alternative to an expensive locket at a fine jeweler a true steal at a sale price of under 30 00	17
1	i thought this was a very pretty lil keepsake i think simple is very nice and it 's simple in design and what not plus it 's not too expensive and as a thoughtful gift it will win lots of points	17
1	i bought this locket and got it engraved with my sons name on it \( caden \) it looked great you could fit 5 or 6 letters on it it was a good locket	17
1	i believe the heart shaped locket is a one of a kind thing it is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large the silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures due to the size of the locket a dainty smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket therefore while i was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews i took a risk and am happy with this purchase the pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection good gift sincerely the guy who usually blows it on the valentine 's day gift	17
1	a really beautiful watch with very very nice casing adjustable strap which fix easily on my 4 and 8 year old children they love it	17
1	the facets make the chain quite sparkly i found it perfect for all my pendants not flimsy but not too heavy and not twisty like some other type chains	17
1	this is a nice chain with a durable lobster claw clasp the diameter is somewhat small but i will probably order another chain with a larger diameter	17
1	i am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase the earrings were more beautiful than i expected i will definitely purchase jewelry from amazon in the future ! !	17
1	these came in great condition and with a nice box to store them in ! they are very pretty but if you do n't like heavy earrings these wo n't be for you	17
1	the product arrived quickly and without a hitch i really liked the earrings when i saw them they were better than expected i'm very pleased thank you	17
1	i had seen the gold orange face version of this casio watch for years but did n't know it came in black \( and white \) until i found it on amazon i really like the classic good looks of this watch nice rugged case smooth clicking rotating bezel sturdy band etc for lt 60 this watch truly delivers awesome quality and value the digital features are great too i 've received a few compliments from co workers on this watch already overall an awesome watch for the money and i could n't be happier with it	17
1	i 've owned this model for about seven years and i think i 'll buy another to keep on standby in case i break the original \( i'm not gentle with my watches while working playing \) tough pretty easy to set good features and classic diver style at a great price what 's not to like \? would n't mind having a light on the lcd otherwise it is proven a great investment battery lasts 2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same \( cracks develop after a while \) no corrosion \( duh stainless steel \) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far	17
1	a great item i received the watch box storage chest very quickly and was very happy overall with the purchase it was as described in perfect condtion and a great buy too	17
1	this is a beautiful watch storage box great value my husband is a watch collector plenty of room for the large invicta and croton watches nice design and color a must have for anyone with a extensive watch collection	17
1	my husband has become an avid watch collector so i gave him this box for christmas the design of the box is as attractive as its contents my husband says that it is easy to use too from the looks of things i will have to get another box for his ever increasing collection	17
1	beautiful box to hold most of my watches have two other watch boxes that hold 11 watches ea and some rings this box holds those watches in less space ! having no place for the rings is not a minus in my opinion nice being able to see 10 of my most worn watches at a glance ! another 10 in the drawer below if you have several watches that you want to put in a nice looking good quality box you will not go wrong buying this item	17
1	this is a real nice looking box i'm expecting great leaps in organization for all my wrist wear tech swiss also receives an a for getting this out to me so swiftly	17
1	this is an outstanding purchase at a great price and quick service and deliverythanks amazo	17
1	i love all of the bracelets that i 've purchased from this vendor they are cute and inexpensive also i 've recieved so many compliments on this bracelet i'm very pleased with this jewelry vendor	17
1	i have bought several of their bracelets but this one has a special quality to it it looks so expensive and is so pretty matches everything what can i say i guesss the lord was good to me finding this at a price i can afford the first time i wore it i got a compliment everyone wants to know where i got it i love this bracelet	17
1	i love this watch i thought by looking at the pictures and reading other comments that it was going to be big and bulky i was immediately surprised at how light it was it is easy to read and keeps good time it is also a very handsome watch the rotating bezel is a quick and easy way to time anything \( lasting less than a hour \) highly recommended !	17
1	i received the product early and was just what i expected nice packaging and great product i would buy again thanks amazon	17
1	this watch is a classic i have no issues with it losing minutes i am very tough on watches i never take them off and this watch has been a real tank i was needlessly worried that the red and blue dial would chip or be scratched off i am amazed that it has not b c i have accidentally scraped smashed it into doors walls etc same for the dial tough as diamonds it is a big watch so it may not be for everyone but if you like the styling it is a steal and the seals will never weaken b c it will never be opened to change a battery i am very impressed	17
1	i love the look of my seiko it 's the best for the money i will buy more seikos in the future it 's a great product	17
1	i had my order within 48 hours ! product was great as well ! ! ! !	17
1	i will purchase again from pugster the only negative is it took a while to get here once i ordered but the quality is great	17
1	this necklace came exactly as pictured with a nice big blue box to store it in i feel it was a great value for the money i would recommend purchasing if you like topaz jewelry	17
1	these are very well crafted little earrings i love how they look and the price just ca n't be beat ! these have made me want to buy many more things from silver insanity ! the only problem i did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long and it pokes the side of my head when i sleep otherwise i could n't love them more !	17
1	as a tarantula keeper \( i have 5 at home \) i always try to look for unique items such as these caution they are really tiny ! i 've already lost one of them \( guess it scurried away \) it 's nice to see that they actually look like tarantulas and not true spiders	17
1	pros the blue topaz stone is beautiful with great quality and great cut the white gold is a perfect choice to combine with the blue of the stone and the diamonds cons the chain is kind small and thin the diamonds are tiny with less than good quality overall i am a pleased customer i bought it as a gift for the topaz stone not for the diamonds or the chain by the way she looks stunning with this necklace	17
1	i was kind of worried when i read some of the other reviews for this but i'm so glad i ordered it ! it is sooooo much more beautiful in person than in the picture it 's wonderfully sparkly and just the right size it did take a bit long to ship but it was worth the wait	17
1	this is such a gorgeous bracelet ! i'm glad i ordered it for myself	17
1	very pleased with this bracelet the crystals are gorgeous it is a wow bracelet	17
1	when i received this bracelet i was absolutely knocked off my feet ! ! it is larger than it looks in the picture and is absolutely stunning	17
1	needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything including great taste she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it it arrived promptly in time for christmas and it is very stunning not gaudy at all just classic style beauty could probably be worn to her office each day \( upscale casual \) or if she is dressed up the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself and i am not a huge jewelry fan	17
1	service was great ring is beautiful and of good quality it was set promptly	17
1	this product has helprd me to easily open the back of my watch and replace the battery i am sure it will satisfy me when i want to change the battery on my more expensive watch that has the back that screws on but also since i have n scale model trains the tweezers and small tools have been most helpful i e pliers hammer etc	17
1	this is a good collection of tools that you should have if you want to do minor watch repairs at home i had 5 6 watches lying around and i could not use them coz they ran out of battery was able to open all of them with tools in this kit it doesnt have any user guide but if you have used tools then you will be able to figure out where to use what and how the quality of products is pretty good too at least nothing broke during fixing 5 6 watches yet i am very happy with the purchase the hammer was missing from the kit and when i called the customer service they immediately sent me the hammer	17
1	this is an excellent tool set for beginners the quality of the tools is not professional grade but more than adequate for the hobbyists for the price you pay this is an excellent deal a little more money than some of the other kits being sold on amazon com but well worth it as you get a complete set	17
1	i love the workmanship in this piece nicely done and silver insanity has awesome customer service	17
1	i bought this necklace because it was very on sale and i was surprised by how much i loved it when it arrived the beads are actually somewhat darker than they appear in the picture which looks nicer and is easier to match to an outfit it 's a bold necklace but it can dress down quite a bit with the right blouse	17
1	i was browsing through amazon when i came upon nvie jewelry and i absolutely love it ! i bought this necklace for my mom for her birthday but had a hard time not keeping it for myself the necklace was really nice well constructed and it was shipped quickly it looked just like the picture but i have a feeling that each piece of jewelry is truly one of a kind i would recommend nvie designs to anyone for buying really lovely affordably priced jewelry	17
1	i have had many compliments on this watch i have the satisifcation that it cost much less than a jewelery store ps it 's also my dive watch	17
1	what a great buy ! beautiful and high quality watch for a great price it is probably an older version of the seiko coutura watch but it really does not matter	17
1	this watch is very rich looking the price was phenomenal ! i saw this for sale at other retailers for 300 00 plus ! i have received numerous compliments	17
1	the watch is very pretty sturdy enough for everyday wear and elegant enough for dressy occasions excellent price and fast delivery i like the dual tone watch band because i wear both white and yellow gold the gold is n't as brassy as what shows in the picture excellent value	17
1	i purchased this as a gift for mu niece and she thought it was so pretty she liked to weight and she says it is staying nice	17
1	very nice piece just beware of the size it 's much bigger than it appears in this picture it does hang nice on the silver cord however the clasp is backwards and with the cord it does not flex to the correct position	17
1	i bought this gift for my sister in law and it was beautiful it is high quality and looks great	17
1	i just received this today somehow i completely missed that the pendant is on a silver wrapped wire and not a chain had i noticed that i probably would not have ordered this piece and i would have missed out it is very nice it has a nice weight to it not too heavy but substantial the wire lays on my neckline just right and the pendant looks beautiful i'm very pleased with it	17
1	this is a beautiful piece very substantial and unusual ! the only thing that would have made it better is if it had been made with a bigger bail so it could accommodate larger chains than the neckwire it comes on regardless it was well worth the price	17
1	i was impressed with the quality of this pendant including the packaging ! i 've received several complements on the quality and unique design for me it signifies john 15 5 i am the vine and you are the branches i am very pleased with this fine piece of jewelry thank you	17
1	this is an excelent machine pricsie timing and wondeful design i will recommend it to any lover of good watche	17
1	this invicta is a great watch if you are looking for a giant size timepiece with a touch of elegance it is well designed and the fit and finish is good the citizen automatic movement is a workhorse and very reliable when you open the box this watch will impress you and everytime you wear it it will be noticed it is not for the timid comments and more information can be obtained through the www invictawatchforum com see what others think and general watch information	17
1	my sister loved her necklace she was very pleased with it and so am i	17
1	it 's a beautiful pendant the stone is genuine and very beautiful i love it	17
1	it 's pretty but functional my daughter wears it constantly and can roughhouse around in it and it 's safe	17
1	am very pleased with my purchase speedy shipping will use agai	17
1	great ring for the price it is very pretty on the finger and comfortable not too heavy	17
1	i love this ring ! nice and simple goes with my skin tone great i use my hands a lot at work and this thing has n't scuffed yet ! great buy great price will definitly buy from them again !	17
1	never off time never wind never re set the true lazy person 's watch	17
1	exceptional value for the money ! the watch is beautiful and the recipient was particularly impressed that it had the correct time and date upon his opening the present no more watches that say the 31st on the 1st of the month	17
1	watch is a very sturdy and water resistant time piece however the resin band is very uncomfortable at times	17
1	the charm itself was slightly smaller then expected but for the price it was fine shipping time was good	17
1	i received these earrings as a gift and i do n't know what they are made of but i get an awful lot of compliments on them they seem to change color in response to what i am wearing i would definitely order other silver insanity items	17
1	the earrings were a gift and were most warmly received ! they were a real hit !	17
1	i have two pairs of earrings from this company and they look amazing i ca n't tell if they 're plastic or glass but they really do look as beautiful as in the picture and i always get compliments when i wear them sometimes people ask me what stone they are they ca n't even tell it 's synthetic ! ! no bubbles or anything like the bad review here says	17
1	these are dainty and somewhat small but lovely to wear to work diamonds are a nice clear quality	17
1	these are so danty and comfortable to wear was an excellent price as well thanks for the offer	17
1	arrived timely a bit smaller than i had envisioned but beautiful and comfortable to wear	17
1	these earrings are perfect to wear every day they are comfortable to sleep in no need to take them off in the evening they are small and classy will look great with any outfitthey are exactly what i was looking for and i'm really happy with them to help you see the size of these earrings and how they look on someone 's ear i 've uploaded an image of this earring in my ear see it in customer images	17
1	this is my second casio watch of this type the watch is maintenance free adjusts itself every night and takes care of daylight savings time	17
1	i am pleased with the watch it is flashy and keeps good time however i am still trying to figure out why it stops from time to time i think i inadvertantly push a button that stops it it is a small annoyance but has happened 4 5 times in the last month	17
1	i 've been through generations of digital watches with plastic bands my wife thinks they look nerdy but i like the alarm and other gadgets i'm tired of wearing these things out though and wanted something that looked nicer this is a very nice looking sturdy watch which was what i wanted it also has the window with the digital time date alarm etc my only complaint is that that window is tiny and not easy to see also the light for night viewing is wimpy the watch works fine and is very nice looking but i wish the window were a bit larger one year later the digital window keeps setting it self back to jan 1 and 12 00 noon poor quality look elsewher	17
1	i totally love this necklace it goes with many things i own and really enhances a low neckline i get compliments each time i wear it	17
1	it 's a good value for anyone with no time and a small budget ! five stars for value	17
1	i purchased this as a gift for my secret santa and she wore it a week strait	17
1	i bought this watch on amazon for my husband who is an avid runner and he loves it ! ! he sometimes has difficulty with the heart rate while running because of sweat \( so he says \) but otherwise no complaints \( and he can be a tough critic \)	17
1	my husband loves the big face on the watch that 's tilted for easy viewing while running he never takes it off even in the shower the heart rate monitor reads clearly and easily	17
1	but no calories count i love this watch despite that it 's well designed the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym \( most that say polar ready \) so that was a great surprisethe chest strap has a battery that is user serviceable as well as the watch so you do n't have to send it to the manufacturer \( like the polar hr \) overall i think is a good buy but the is missing the calories count that would be my only upgrade	17
1	i purchased this for my wife on christmas she loves it looks wonderful though it is smaller than it appears in the picture	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend as his valentine 's day gift he loved it ! it 's a great price for this watch as well	17
1	are you tired of replacing watch batteries \? do you bump into things with your watch \? if so buy this one it 's a beautiful practical watch that 's available at a very good price it winds itself mechanically as you move your wrist about no batteries it 's shock and water resistant bang it around swim with it wash dishes with it shower with it no problem it 's gold plated stainless steel with a gold plated stainless steel band it 's beautiful it 's big so if you have small wrists buy the ladies version if not buy the men 's version	17
1	this dainty heart looks absolutely beautiful on it picks up the colors of your clothing it is an amazing price for such a beautiful pendant	17
1	for the price this is a great buy ! colors are good has a nice weightto it ! would buy more from this merchant	17
1	i purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for christmas they are very pretty and they loved them the quality is good for price	17
1	great item do n't go looking for huge diamonds but it looked good over all and my girlfriend loved it so i guess that 's the most important thing	17
1	lovely little apple charm just what i wanted picture a little deceptive though i thought the charm would be larger than it actually was otherwise great item i'm happy	17
1	the 30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description about the watch i 'll just say it fits very well on my relatively small wrist if you like the watch but think it wo n't fit well because you have small wrist do n't worry it fits just fine enjoy after wearing this watch for few weeks i realized i am just like many others wearing the calibre 2100 exclusively now	17
1	great looking watch and i shopped around for the best price for about three weeks before i ordered from amazon shipped lightning quick also	17
1	overall the product is great i have had the watch for nearly three months now and have had no problems with it the quartz movement is very accurate the chronograph works very well and i use the alarm every day the only drawback is that you have to reset the date on months that are less than 31 days otherwise this watch is fantastic and with the eco drive you never have to worry about repacing the battery and the titanium version is so lightweight that you hardly notice that you are wearing a watch	17
1	very high quality watch i recommend these to all luxury fans works without any problems my old citizen chronograph are working for over than 12 years by now daily used	17
1	i have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough everytime i 've accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall i worry that i might 've scratched it but everytime \( knock on wood \) it 's come out clean another good thing about this watch is that it 's light for a big watch it does n't weigh me down like a stainless steel model i 've gotten many compliments on it i love it	17
1	this watch is beautiful i cannot say enough good things about this watchs design its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy it keeps perfect time and is very light weight i bought the calibre 8700 before this one and i love both of them but i would give this one a slight edge my two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the calibre 8700 does have and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not saphire i am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as saphire crystal would be	17
1	this item is exactly as advertised well designed well made and heavy my only complaint \( and the reason for the 4 stars \) is that the chain is way to short i knew this when i ordered it so i had other arrangements made but a 26 or 28 chain would be much better in my opinion than a 20 great value for the money however	17
1	this was a gift and was lovely and beautiful not too big not to small delivery time was great strongly advice to buy this	17
1	i am very pleased with my purchase the item came to me in 3 days via dhl in a new condition well packed and safe recomended for reasonable prices	17
1	i absolutely love these earrings very well made beautiful design and a lot of silver	17
1	bought 14 fossil watches for christmas gifts all arrived in fine shape from watch zone of the group this was one of the nicest perhaps a little heavier than one would expect recommended	17
1	this was my first fossil watch i usually buy burberry or d g but i was so hard for me to tell time on the watches so my friend told me to buy a fossil so i did and i love it is so stylish and cute i love the way it changes color from different angles	17
1	this is a really fun and fashionable watch it has a bangle style band and can be worn slightly loose or snug i like the pink dial that changes color depending on the angle and lighting the dial looks pink yellow or purple i also like how fossil made the band adjustable remove or add as many links as necessary there is no need to have the watch adjusted at the jewelry counter	17
1	this watch is automatic has a sapphire crystal and is invicta what more can u ask \? and all this for just 200 the piece is heavy u can taste the quality by holding it the movement can be seen in the front and back one of the better looking movs iv ever seen i own 7 automatic watches 3 of them are invictas but this have the coolest movement inside it holds the charge up to 3 days and mine only losses 3 minutes in a week buy this watch is very very reliable	17
1	light intricate and very cute ! they came very quickly and the price was very fair ! i have a second piercing in my left ear and i like to wear one there so along with my other jewelry i always have a fairy whispering in my ear	17
1	this chain was exactly what i was looking for ! it is so cheap but really good quality ! i am really happy with this product	17
1	a nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty it is fine delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it the are reflective areas that shimmer every 1 4 inch or so i am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning the chain feels strong and less likely to tangle great purchase for the price	17
1	i was looking for a cheap but nice chain this is perfect arrived in two days beautiful chain nice strong and polished great buy for five dollars or a little more	17
1	very delicate very pretty chain it does n't kink up when i wear it and it 's the perfect length i have worn this every day since i received it	17
1	beautiful detailed and accurate time piece i have a few watches and this is one i place ahead of all the others i have large face and can be read at a glance	17
1	as a field engineer i have to work with tools inside machinery more often than not i keep my watch and i have had several scratched watches in the past so i was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try after 9 months of using it daily this watch has still not a single scratch the quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture	17
1	the watch is actually better than it appeared from the photo one of the few times when i can actually state that something is an even better value than it appeared	17
1	i am studying pilot for now i order this watch and i think it is useful to me as the flight computer with me all the time and i do n't just use it when i am in flight but also in the normal life because it look too luxury watch and i like it too much	17
1	i 've had the watch for a week now and i'm very happy with it both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week \( checked against apple network time server \) the watch looks good and i ca n't say i 've had a problem with the digital display if it was brighter i think it would tend to be distracting the slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1 of buyers will actually use it one small negative point i have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers are n't which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness a silly oversight hence 4 stars overall though well worth the money	17
1	you can pay hundreds more for the same product but why \? this watch has everything th emore expensive brands do but it costs much less it is not a cheapy either it still has the pulsar durability and usefulness great buy	17
1	first of all i recieved the item in a very timely fashion approx 3 days second the packaging was very nice the chain was a good quality snake chain and the pendent was a very good quality heavy and prettier in person	17
1	my grand son calls my wife nana so i had to get it for her for mothers day great product	17
1	we do n't call our nana grandmother so this necklace is perfect	17
1	i purchased this watch for three reasons 2 time zones backlighting constant display of day of week month day did not disappoint looks cool i bought this watch on the basis of the other earlier reviews very accurate account of the features and performance i wear it for everyday use	17
1	this is probably one of the lightest smallest watches with an interval timer feature which is why i got it it 's also pretty cheap it has a decent number of other options as well this particular seller had the cheapest price with the most recent model very quality	17
1	this watch has a large display and easy to use functions i get a lot of compliments on the unique band it 's small enough to look feminine yet still sporty i ca n't think of anything i would like to change about it	17
1	this pin is n't as pretty in person as it is in the picture online it is nice but not spectacular	17
1	i ordered these earrings knowing they would be small if my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit these earrings are really tiny and do not fit me i need the next higher up size these are like 3 8 inch way small for me and also way difficult to even bend manipulate to open the hoop	17
1	the earrings were exactly what i wanted the delivery date was as promised	17
1	these are very nice light weight earrings the look silver and black even though they are not so keep that in mind when you purchase them as to what the will go with i wear lots of black so it was a pleasant surprise for me very antique look to them	17
1	these earrings are a substantial weight even though they are hollow and the filigree detailing is superb ! i fell in love with these when i saw them on the site while shopping for xmas presents for friends and just had to order a pair for myself	17
1	these are my favorite earrings i wear them constantly they are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit they are a bit larger than you might anticipate and it is a size i really like but which might overpower some the picture at least on my monitor is about life sized	17
1	these are gorgeous earrings that just happened to match a pendant i already had i 've had many compliments on them	17
1	for the price this watch ca n't be beat very thin very light and it gets quite a few comments i am anxious to see how the crystal holds up as apparently skagen is notorious for fragile crystals at 75 however i wo n't be that upset if it has to be replaced overall an excellent buy for the price and no pulling of the arm hair	17
1	very slick easy to read watch with the contrast of silver hands on a dark blue face appreciate the smooth comfortable mesh watchband which easily adjusts to your wrist size	17
1	this is a nice looking watch overall if you like this style in black look for the t233xltmn it is a very very nice watch and popular in europe	17
1	the band and face are both so much darker than they look in the picture also amazon neglected to send the owners manual and warranty information \( i had to contact skagen for this \) the watch is very attractive though	17
1	i really like the face and style of the watch i like the mesh band but the wire may snag clothing or fabric	17
1	i have skin allergies and was not able to find a watch that i could have on my skin until i found this watch the price of the watch could not be beat for the chance that i could not have it on thank you for suppling a great watch	17
1	i'm a picky person when it comes to watches and i'm very rough with them this watch has far exceeded my expectations on all accounts its so light i often forget i'm even wearing a watch i 've gotten several comments on it as well the only negative thing i can say about this watch is that the mesh material of the band is difficult to get water out of i useally take mine off to wash my hands overall its a good looking well made tough time piece	17
1	my girlfriend bought me this watch its design is great and what 's better it 's super light \( titanium hooray ! ! \) i think no country other than japan can produce this kind of watch citizen you rock	17
1	very nice watch ! keeps good time and it 's extremely light weight looks great	17
1	very light weight appropriately sized not too gaudy or flashy accurate so far reasonably priced pretty much everything i was after in a watch	17
1	these earrings are of very nice quality and were what i expected i am pleased with these	17
1	well this is the watch band that i originally had on my seiko watch i searched the internet to find a replacement amazon had it for a good price i ordered it and got it in the mail three days later	17
1	we got these earrings for our daughter on her 6th birthday she loves jewelry and especially earrings the color is a little pale the actual earrings are n't quite as pink as they look in the picture but they are good quality and look great my daughter wears them all the time this was a good buy these earrings are great for anyday wearing or with evening wear they look very stylish	17
1	big numbers easy to use all the functions i use it for flying and timing my instrument approache	17
1	we finally have a stopwatch that fufills our every need the display was so large all i had to do was merely glance down i 've gone through several stopwatches but this one is the most durable	17
1	it look very nice will be an excellente gift for any friend i just have a complaint they just carry this item in zise 7 but still looking very fanc	17
1	i was more than pleased when i received this pendant ! it has a nice feel and you actually know it 's there instead of it feeling like a good wind would carry it away you have to look extremely close to see the peridot in the setting but that is all i have to complain about ! definitely worth your money	17
1	i ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone and when i received it i loved the look and feel of it so much that i quickly ordered another just for myself it 's a very sleek looking watch very lightweight on your wrist and the price on amazon here is at lear 40 below what i have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls i intend to use this watch for special occasions as i believe it will complement dressier attire	17
1	i really liked this watch before i bought it and then i liked it some more for another 2 3 weeks but after that it started to seem plain to me i want something more fanc	17
1	this watch looks incredible the case is solid titanium and the mesh band is tiny stainless steel links infused with titanium it really can go with anything you could wear it with khakis jeans a suit pretty much anything because the color is so versatile if you 're looking for a quality watch that looks good and for a really good price well look no further	17
1	they were quite a bit larger than i expected i do n't recall if they listed a size on the page but i am 100 pleased with the many other purchases i 've made with silver insanity	17
1	i'm wearing it at the moment it 's lasted this long i do n't know why people complaining about if people wanted a nightvision face for a peice of 18th century tech they should just buy a seiko its great for it 's sole funtionality which is to look pretty in dance halls you buy it to get stares guys or dare i let you do this but let your girlfriends buy it for you	17
1	this watch was a gift for my husband he loves it ! he wanted a slim watch he could wear around and this is it	17
1	this watch looks classy wears comfortably and is very light my only complaint so far is that it seems to scratch rather easily	17
1	this is a great watch the clasp is easy to adjust and takes only 10 minutes to adjust it was shipped well before the estimated time and is in perfect condition well made and light it 's extremely slim so if you really like heavy watches this may not be your choice otherwise it is perfect for everyone	17
1	this is the best watch if you consider following things 1 looks the color of dial and the feeling of dial on hands is really beautiful 2 size and thickness if you search for slim watches skagen will be your first and final choice 3 mesh band this type of band is the speciality of skagen its un comparable 4 price considering the price for overall quality this watch is really affordable bottom line everyone will notice and appreciate about it	17
1	another quality item and very pleased looks superb with the matching bracelet will buy more and more from this company as the prices are so reasonable and the quality is awesome ! o	17
1	the watch is very nice and it came in an excellent condition ! it is very beautiful and it has many operations	17
1	i bought this watch a month bak an i am really happy wit it ita sightly complicated to learn but overall its absolutely amazing its a steal at that price only pwoblem is that the temperature indicator takes time to adjust	17
1	i was searching for a watch for weeks saw a picture of this watch and paused intrigued i began to read the specs alarm chronograph thermometer light stopwatch world time zones and more what 's the catch \? 55usd c'mon seriously with all those features is that all \? i was still skeptical but when i got the watch put it on my wrist i was sold solid well crafted unique sporty elegant combination my only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature we ca n't have the world but casio has come close with this price i can honestly say go for it	17
1	this watch has it all at a nice price the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand hair if u have and i doubt that u do n't have else is a masterpiece all stainless steel even base thermomener and a smart cronograph plus 3 yrs battery this is my favourite no other watch has this price quality proportion try it and u will be satisfied sporty but looks elegant too	17
1	the craftsmanship on this watch it absolutely top rate very nice band not flimsy or cheap the world time is very cool	17
1	i love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch they are very milky and personally i think the watch would look better without them at all if that 's the only quality they had great looking and i'm glad i finally bought it for myself	17
1	just got my watch today it is the perfect watch i have been shopping around and i was thrilled to find it on amazon for more than 100 less than retail stores ! ilove it	17
1	i had been looking at this particular watch for over a year and simply did not want to spend the money on it i found it at amazon com for half the price i had seen in department stores so i decided to buy it it is a fabulous watch i look forward to wearing it each day it looks great with really dressy suits or jeans and a top it is a great piece	17
1	these earrings are very pretty i'm very pleased ! nice faceting and sparkle the stones are a medium bright green with a little yellow and brown mixed in which only seem to make the stones more intriguing and beautiful the peridot stones in these earrings are the prettiest i 've owned so far highly recommend	17
1	i am very please with this purchase the earrings are a very good quality !	17
1	they sparkle well and look as good as anything else i have seen at the mall stores i like the non cup style studs as i think they allow more light to flow through the stone save your cash and get these she will be very happy and you can spend the extra money on fishing lures or something \) do not go to jared 's jewelers if they are near you they are evil people	17
1	i am very pleased with these earrings they are a great quality at this price i would also recommend the matching pendant great set !	17
1	the earrings were such a hit that another daughter wants to buy a pair	17
1	let me just say my girlfriend loved them and then loved m	17
1	as soon as i saw this watch i had to get it i loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful it 's a really nice looking and good quality watch the only problem i do have with it is that the face is quite big if you have a small wrist it is very large i still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller	17
1	i just got this watch as a christmas present it is gorgeous the only thing is it 's a little bigger than i would like it to be the face is so femanine but the size makes it a little masculine the face is about an inch and a half in diameter and the band is a little over a half inch wide because it is so pretty i am keeping it however if you prefer a small dainty watch maybe this one is n't for you my friends are telling me bigger watches are in now so maybe they 're right \? \?	17
1	beautiful wear them all the time sincerely gai	17
1	i was very pleased with this purchase these earrings are very simple yet elegant they could be worn with jeans or to a more dressed up occasion a good choice for the price	17
1	the pendant is striking shiny and great to look at the diameter of the pendant is the size that i expected and the necklace itself is adjustable so you can choose how high or low you want to wear it great purchase would buy it again	17
1	this is my second skagen watch my first one which was almost identical to my new one lasted ten years of daily use i love the two tone combination of gold and stainless steel my only disappointment is that at a glance it is difficult to tell the minute hand from the second hand i think the hour and minute hands should be slightly more heavier than the second hand otherwise i love the profile design of this watch including where the comfortable mesh band meets the watch face	17
1	a very nice watch for the price very low profile and nice flexible band would like smaller face but otherwise a great watch	17
1	i'm delighted with my skagen watch as i was with the previous one i lost i find the clean modern design makes me feel elegantly turned out the analog dial is easy to read the mesh band is easy to adjust to my wrist size the silver color coordinates with my silver jewelry	17
1	i love this bracelet it 's very pretty looks just like it was shown looks expensive tasteful i have bigger wrists so i 'd like it better if it came in larger sizes but it goes great with my watch	17
1	i ordered three pair of these earrings for christmas gifts for the preteen set and am absolutely delighted very nice quality and beautifully presented boxed in a small velvet pouch absolute perfection	17
1	we sent this necklace to our daughter it arrived actually earlier than anticipated and she just loves it what a great company to deal wit	17
1	actually i ordered this necklace for my best friend 's birthday and she loved she is a very stylish woman so i am so thankful for this product it is worth every cent i paid and i am thinking to buy one for myself too	17
1	i ordered it and it came very quickly \( earlier than expected \) i love this pearl necklace	17
1	works great fits well and has a nice design definitely recommend i	17
1	finally a phoenix that does n't look like a dragon ! just the right size and beautiful detail i love it	17
1	the order arrived on time packaged very nicely they are quality earrings which was one of my concerns buying on line and not able to handle them the price was fair i would recommend and would myself purchase again	17
1	i received the necklace and realized that the color was a little more orange than red i bought it for a friend and i think she will like it regardless the pendant is very large	17
1	i bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace i had seen at the smithsonian institute i love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi strands of this design this combination truly illuminates my evening wear by far the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court with so much class it is still affordable this necklace is an exceptional gem	17
1	the th watch was a dream watch to the person it was gifted to it was bought for a friend and he just loved it	17
1	an awesome watch i absolutely love it incredible value at this price	17
1	i am pleased with the watch it syncs with the big clock in colorado every morning at midnight we also have a wall clock at home which does the same thing and the difference between the 2 is no more the 1 second at worst for 40 you ca n't go wrong only complaint is my wrist is in between removing 1 or 2 links from the watch band so i chose 1 it rides a tad lose on my wrist but 2 links would make it too tight guess i need to lose a couple more pounds so i can take another link out !	17
1	this is probably one of casio 's least expensive wave ceptors it synchs every day indoors in a watch case that 's not by a window the digital display shows the day date and other info such as which time zone what time it synched i'm just concerned that the analog digital display and receiving every day will make it a battery eater it 's available in different dials but the blue seems to be the most common i give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright and the crystal is acrylic scratches easily but that 's not really an issue because i have about 15 watches and this one gets very little wrist time	17
1	i was pleased with this item it was just like i expected	17
1	these earrings looked better than i expected they sparkle on my daughter 's ears very pretty	17
1	in real earrings look much better than on the picture substantial presence of a nice quality jewellery	17
1	nice quality it is a shame that they do not have the same in longer cords as well	17
1	good watch for a firts one ! ! ! ! ! ! simple to handled and very easy to use thanks a lot ! !	17
1	overall this watch is good large numbersfairly standard set of basic features \( date alarm stop watch \) crown seems fairly resistant to scratchingindiglo lighting is greatcontrary to the description however the chronograph does not have a lap capability it only has a split function \( 2 way \) as a reminder it does not have a countdown timer which seems to be a common theme for many timex watches	17
1	great errings i got these for my 12 y o neice but decided they were too long for her but loved them for myself very cute	17
1	swarovski has been making crystal jewelry since 1892 and their consistent quality has kept the company going through wars and the rise and fall of empires these excellent earrings are made of sterling silver and swarovski crystals and are quite attractive if you are looking for some nice crystal and silver earrings then these are the ones to get by the way they look great when combined with the heart star and starburst crystal tattoos which i also highly recommend !	17
1	and my wife liked it it 's shiny what more can be said \) i wish the smaller heart was a little larger you can barely tell what it is	17
1	let 's face it it 's hard to find a watch that has it all a nice band a decent color scheme an elegant but not overbearing look this has it i'm sure some will say that the animation is too much but it 's very subtle and it can be stopped at the tough of a button the crystal is not too large and not too small and the band is tough	17
1	bought this to use at work since i had to send in the one i usually wear for repairs lumi is extremely bright when charged the monster has gained 1 minute in 2 days which is not bad for an inexpensive seiko swapped the band with a nato fits a little bit better on my wrist overall a good purchase	17
1	see all over for double the price works great get lots of compliments more the my more expensive watches	17
1	bought this as a gift for my brother he was impressed by the quality and feel of the watch he wears it so i think i did pretty good considering he 's a tough person to buy something for	17
1	this is a rugged no frills watch that uses old school technology to do the job so they wo n't be around for long	17
1	these earrings are the beautiful deep blue of genuine sapphires and the 1 0 carat size is just the right size \( anything larger might tend to look fake i 've purchased from this merchant many many times and always find myself typing in sabrina silver whenever i need or want a new and inexpensive piece of jewelry they 're the best and i 've never been disappointed	17
1	beautiful deep blue round crystal post earrings i love them	17
1	these earrings arrived in time for the holidays beautiful earrings excellent price fast shipping	17
1	this is the only watch my husband has worn to work for years we were happy to find it online and the price was good so we bought 2 of them	17
1	this is a great ring for the price it is smooth low profile perfect size ring	17
1	got this at amazon for a great price the design is by edwatd mirell whose collection of mens 's jewelry is unrivaled \( sp \? \) this bracelet sells at michaels jewelers at the mall for 100 00 i'm getting some of his other designs here at amazon you wo n't regret it it 's an elegant but masculine bracelet happy holiday 's	17
1	este es un lindo producto hermoso y elegante pero se raya muy facil igual me gusta y lo uso todos los dias pero no creo que sea algo de muy larga duracion	17
1	you know how usual it is to see people wearing the tiffany love charmbracelet \? this looks exactly like one of those with a twist it look more like tiffany bracelet with follie follie charms and its a watch at a price like that it 's a steal ! however the bracelet is a little too long for my wrist what 's more interesting is that the box of the watch works as a clock itself how practical can that be if you are looking for a chrambracelet this it is	17
1	best item i bought for a great price i would like to see more like thi	17
1	when i recevied my watch i was so excited ! it looked so cool in the picture and ever so when i got it the harry face on it was neat and the case that comes wit it was so detailed ! ca n't wait 2 sport it when the movie and the last final book arrives ! ! !	17
1	love the watch it looks even better than it did in the picture it was supposed to be a gift for my nephew but i kept it \( i know i'm terrible \) but i ordered him another one	17
1	these earrings are very pretty they are a nice size and they are n't heavy at all very lightweight i have had them for a week or so now and have gotten nothing but compliments on them they are great and so is the price ! the vendor sent them very promptly and there were no problems	17
0	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	18
0	i tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that i put it down in frustration it reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat the theme is interesting the execution poor cannot recommend	18
0	i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little	18
0	i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction if thoughts are that powerful they need to be resrained earlier i do n't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive logic can be quite painful when left alone but sometimes it has to be	18
0	i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times	18
0	let me see how many books can i write to preach to the choir about the same thing she must of got dumped by a handful of liberal boyfriends \( what intellegent person would want her \) and now she 's trying to get back at 'em ca n't wait for the next i hate liberals so much and here are my reasons why book she should join fox she would fit right in	18
0	all throughtout this book alex delaware and his police friend milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover they have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture the reader longs for the pair to actually do something in the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings that is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking i read and enjoyed several of the early alex delaware books and then quit looking for new ones now i know why	18
0	this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up	18
0	why in the world would anyone publish a writer 's bread and butter notes to his agent \? besides the money i mean there are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor whom heinlein feels did him dirty but in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master just enjoy the stories and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published	18
0	i thought it was me until i read several other reviews of predator ms cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess if she 's going to continue the scarpetta series she needs to get back on track creating characters that we care about i finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me what a disappointment	18
0	i did not finish the book \( i got about 70 of the way through before i realized i could not bear to read one more page \) maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better but i doubt it this is the first time i can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book the characters were flat and plot went nowhere please there are million of books out there spare yourself and find something else to read anything	18
0	this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature it is timely but it is not timeless not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly not one scene is memorable the true nature of the book soap opera is cloaked under its many pages messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story and she seems to have believed her publicity machine i ca n't believe that her husband who a great literary critic would not talk her out of publishing this oh i forgot money and fame trumps quality every time	18
0	i thought the title was interesting so i bought this book wow what a disappointment this is sappy and poorly written how does mitch albom keep getting on the best sellers list	18

0	you all like misogynist comics	18
0	despite early promise marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self reflection this effort fails to deliver on the author 's experience and acumen the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of united states rhetoric and policies on africa i had hoped for more given the fine record in newsprint of this well traveled journalist	18
0	i read some raving reviews about this book but i admit i was quite disappointed factual i'm sure but it lacks details and tries to touch on too much without going into any depth many other pregnancy books go into further detail	18
0	the characters are uninteresting and 2 dimensional the dialog hackneyed i have no idea why it 's on the new york times bestseller list it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else do n't waste your money	18
0	if you are looking for a book that does a cover to cover job of bashing western civilization with complete and obvious bias this is it	18
0	one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm no way ! those two books were edge of your seat reading experiences this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring the action does n't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then the cliched writing and deification of balf 's subjects make this book very hard to get through unless you are a serious kayaking fan i would not recommend this book	18
0	i had somewhat forgotten how greg bear wrote his descriptions of the jart are so obscure and long winded the reader may as well just turn the page i found it annoying that greg bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than eon my largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos duplicated words letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive it really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated while i 'd admit that an author is more concerned with flow plot and technical accuracy the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals	18
0	i was very disapointed in the book basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others twisted their words and put his own spin on it it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down there are good books out there written by people who were there i suggest you take a look at those i read many good one 's but this book wasnt in that catagory	18
0	this story is very dark full of menace and dark thoughts not great for kids ok for adults if that 's what you like a hard story not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments	18
0	this simply is n't history in real life people do things for reasons historians explain what happened and \( to some extent \) why that is how they are able to infer as yet unknown details and even predict future attitudes and acts pappe gets plenty of facts wrong but his biggest failing is to ascribe incorrect or even impossible motives to many of the people of the region this book is propaganda masquerading as history	18
0	though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology it 's the dryest most aesthetically difficult to read textbook especially if you happen to be studying the material online through independent study the publisher needs to redesign the book and or you need to have a better online course professor it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material \( which is interesting in itself \) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction	18
0	nothing in this book was usable for me okay very little if i was trying to write the next ethan frome then this book would be perfect instead i write sci fi and fantasy i was looking for tips to improve my description of things this book recommends describing different things too much emphasis on metaphor \( which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious \) if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate this book might be a waste of your time however poets and pure literary writers might find it more useful than i did	18
0	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18
0	if you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer this book will provide lots of information it also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog but for my taste i found the photographic results to be uninspiring too much posing too much portraiture lighting not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is	18
0	the worst book i 've read \( actually i was listening to the audiobook \) the characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that i found myself yelling at the tape player i know i know already i could n't stand the torture anymore i did n't even finish it i have enjoyed some of ds 's earlier work but will not buy another	18

0	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18
0	no longer intended to be a comprehensive reference the guinness book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that are n't even actual records \( most overrated celebrity \) if you 're going to do this why not offer one edition that plays it by the book \? so dies a noble institution	18

0	i am not a right winger whatsoever am against our involvement in the mid east but did read this book i ca n't say it better than alan dershowitz who commented about chomsky 's writing in general many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16	18
0	i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is non existent we 're supposed to believe that the haunted passive timid character dave was an all star shortstop in high school \? the book had a great premise and good beginning but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave 's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book 's most intriguing character	18
0	i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction apparently oprah 's as well	18

0	another parasite feeding off the leavings of much more substantial species or perhaps a more apt ocean related metaphor would be comparing malkin 's work to that of the brainless bivalves that cluster around sewer outflows or the mindless jellyfish who flow with the ocean currents but like the ocean neo cons' writings should be taken with more than a grain of salt by the way the reviewer below who wants someone named mccracken reported to amazon i'm sure you can take it instead why do n't you campaign for a zero star feature for reviews or perhaps a fact checking service for publishers of political vitriol like this work of fiction i sure hope no public money has been spent on stuff like this	18
0	i had great expectations of this book but the more i read the worse it got for a person who is supposed to be an 'orientalist' he sure does hate his subject under cover of being a scholar lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning this ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the middle east today powerful people listen to lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the muslim world unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of	18
0	i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title i read this book because it was the subject of an on line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group	18

0	when i realized early on the time i would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept i resolved that i would alert other readers generally i enjoy this author 's works and anticipated this latest tome i was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it 's clues or probable developments everything was telegraphed and nothing was original the conclusion was so lame that i was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue my advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next	18
0	i was at the airport getting ready to fly out to cali and i found this book in the airport gift shop i thought what a stroke of luck i had getting a stephen king title at such a juncture i'm a huge fan despite the fact that i started and finished the book exactly as the plane took off and landed i was sorely disappointed much ado about nothing would be an overstatement	18

0	less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition this book more aptly excerpts the author 's personal conflicts with human relationships a one on one wrestling match with the self with no spectators and no judges the book is a good read for academic analysis but not so fun for venturist philosophy	18
0	i have loved many of jodi picoult 's other books but this one seemed too far fetched i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in fact detracted from it many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release	18

0	american buffalo was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic it is indeed raw but not at all fantastic the dialogue is very choppy and i felt out of the loop with it as if i missed some great detail perhaps this is a play that needs to be enjoyed when seen performed rather than just read i do not recommend	18

0	though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs at one point the author actually defends episiotomies she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth it was both infuriating and saddening if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little this is cute if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth this is not for you !	18
0	while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book it reminds me of the story the emperor has no clothes yes choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying the flipping back and forth was not accomplished in a smooth flowing manner in addition the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone	18

0	obviously from all the reviews this book appeals to many people i am not one of them perhaps it 's because i do n't care for science fiction i found the writing stilted the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them the story boring and the ending \( covered in the introduction \) to be a twilight zone cliche if like me you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed	18

0	mcmurry 's text is a very friendly gentle intro to organic it 's a thoroughly enjoyable read but it does n't teach you what you need to know explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief and the problems included are usually very basic and general \( the spectroscopy and synthesis problems in particular \) if you 're looking to become a chemist this is not the book to learn from i 'd recommend vollhardt and schore 's textbook or any number of sophomore level texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully \( i e on exams or out in the industry \)	18
0	i was hoping that miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a classical epic what we get is a blood splattered 300 lacedaimons in the hood the spartans are presented to be a buch of homo erotic rastafarians the persians rather than the noble middle eastern autocrats presented in their art are drawn by miller to resemble african american gangstas with piercings and skin art everywhere i was looking for xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot if you were into sin city you will love this mishmashed version of the classical tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds	18
0	this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is \( there is n't a single clue at any point in time \) the heroine keeps loosing her memory so you do n't even have the usual good characterizations of hero heroine \( since she ca n't even remember much about herself much less him \) if you like kay go ahead and read it but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard	18
0	the content is excellent the digital format is largely useless i bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition but the digital rights management restrictions mean that i ca n't print selected pages to stick in a folder read on the train or scribble notes on i ca n't even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic 'notes' file the onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one	18

0	i bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me however the information provided is too extensive and confusing listing far too many points in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them the body map listing them is in the first part of the book so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to i also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous the way this system originated is also a little murky this is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public	18

0	i found stale recounting of very well known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics with no insights since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface i was n't expecting historical depth but i was expecting at least one fresh idea i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg \( about technology in the economy of the 19th century \) i was disappointed i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower college freshmen born in the 1980s i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy	18
0	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18
0	surely i'm not the only one who found this book totally bad the only thing it made me wonder about is how it 's possible to write such a thorougly boring book about such fascinating women the writing is just dull and full of the author 's biases and prejudices which just are n't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves it 's written in that old school feminism \( negative no fun \) tone that thank god feminism has since moved beyond my advice find another book about women mystics not filtered through flinder 's lens	18

0	there 's a ton of paper in this book overboard in my opinion wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious i 've taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information has n't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california	18
0	at least this author mentions the mockery strategy martha mdiddy tried to use to fog the public the real issue of whether martha mdiddy committed the crimes and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question did martha stewart lie demonstrates some complacency is it this complacency martha mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote \? is it the greyness of white collar crime that martha mdiddy was trying to play on \? is society the ultimate judge about a person 's guilt or innocence \? if so what has martha mdiddy been judged \? be thoughtful shaw	18

0	i love heinlein i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction i find that his plots and ideas are inventive even this story was inventive in many ways like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters however i found this book as a whole to be very boring much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters the quot main quot characters of each section of the book are n't fully realized at all i would n't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really really bored	18
0	i tried reading it and made it about 3 4 pages i'm pretty sure that 's a bad sign i seem to recall mr sedaris writing about his mother 's bedpan or something the impression i instantly got was beep beep ! pretentious young writer peddling so called bad childhood experiences for fame money and sympathy guess what mr sedaris \? i do n't give a \( expletive deleted \) about your so called bad childhood millions of people have bad childhoods and do n't play the sympathy card check out augusten burrough 's books they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style	18

0	i did not find this book very helpful there is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to quot invest quot in \( it seems the pricier the better and i mean several hundred dollars i actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands \) and what kind of fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals i am not a professional chef just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple good tasting meals for my family the recipes here seem to be time consuming and complicated not much money to be saved here	18

0	will somebody please tell me what the appeal is \? yes i know it 's a classic but it 's a really really boring classic the prequel to charlotte bronte 's jane eyre is the story of bertha mason 's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why bertha went nuts it 's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they did n't like little french girls in jamaica racism sexism and classism drove bertha `round the bend there i 've saved you the trouble of reading it now re read jane eyre instead	18

0	this book is pure fiction nothing more the problem is that is presented as fact albeit little known fact i wo n't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers except to say that i also concur with the criticisms of the book it makes for difficult reading it really is not worth the effort as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end in fact if you are a historian or scholar stay away from it	18
0	flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn 's politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i'm still looking	18
0	a good friend of mine insisted i 'd read this book because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life in the end i was very disappointed not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book but michael crichton 's whole attitude he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences only to revert back to his arrogant narrow minded attitude once again for the next chapter how can anyone claim they 've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in \? sadly this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth i have no desire to read any more of his books	18

0	i know that no book can cover every topic but this book left a lot out it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness which is much more common and some of the information was just plain wrong i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because i could n't feel the baby move it advised that i should call the doctor when i did i found out most women do n't feel it move until 21 weeks unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong i would not suggest this book to anyone	18
0	the only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle the rest is just quotations from other books there is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half the author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said i read it to the end though probably because the author has a very nice writing style he is probably a good playwrite though i have never read any of his plays he just did n't have enough material for a book here i'm surpised it got published	18

0	i could n't read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter your wives are your fields so go to your fields as you like is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i'm not going to finish this book because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic oppressed other type of woman thanks	18

0	should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a business decision \? i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this criminal spectacle designed to make the question of martha mdiddy 's innocence a moot point are honest business practices being pushed to the side \? by normalizing generalizing and minimalizing martha mdiddy 's crimes are we loosing our morality \? how important is integrity to a leader former ceo of a company \? be thoughtful	18

0	i must say i enjoyed the book but the ending was so sudden with so many things left hanging that i was disappointed i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up how did manderly catch fire what did they do when they got to the burning house and how did they pick up their lives all we had at the ending was ashes also the narrator who never gives her name was sometimes very odd hiding behind doors in her own home sneaking food hiding behind chairs the book is worth reading but i wish that instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea du maurier had written a better ending	18
0	i agree with a number of previous reviewers grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between quot wicca quot and quot witchcraft quot wicca is not an old religion indeed it is not much of a religion at all it has always lacked definite theology \( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you 'll get four answers \) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non scholarly lights in fact the book is poor on all accounts from confused terminology to quot chopping quot of source materials this is a waste of money	18
0	the writing was very disjointed in my opinion i had to read and re read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say it was a struggle to read no likeable characters i made it to the part where it was introduced that madeline slept with the ex husband and current wife give me a break ! i moved on immediately too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale	18
0	the book is fine except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer she 's such a boring character she 's young but not motivated to work in fact she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men and get support the point is that she does n't enjoy the job thus a detailed description of her dog training job \( which she does n't seem to enjoy \) was just a boring digression	18
0	a serious snooze fest of course if you are a huge kim newman fan you 'll be pleased literally every other story in the book is one if you must read this book check it out from the library at least that way you wo n't be wasting your money	18
0	i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did	18

0	as a fervent admirer of peter bart 's previous books the gross and who killed hollywood i was extremely disappointed with this one i feel he sold out by flacking for peter guber whose exploits were richly detailed in the book hit and run there 's really nothing new in here and you 'd be well advised to avoid it	18

0	as a certified information systems security professional i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here and i'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it the most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle an integrated approach to security in the organization the book not only lacks effective security integration techniques it does n't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half hearted integration	18

0	my mother bought this for me for christmas she used the available new and used section to get it a little cheaper she ended up paying 160 or so when i put this on my wish list i thought that this hardcover version would be the arabic english english arabic considering that it was 175 and the paperback of the arabic english only was available for 45 as it turns out this is only the hardcover of the arabic english only so for one my mother paid an additional 115 for only the hardcover version of a book that i could have gotten in the paperback for 45 i still do not have the english arabic of the hans wehr edition	18
0	i was a philosophy major in college and i hated this book but then again the whole nambla fic genre really does n't do it for me i'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart good for them i'm incredibly well read and thought this one was just a tepid bore save your time read some dostoevsky some dickens some milton \( \)	18
0	this book started well but fell flat in the middle what little conflict there was in the beginning was resolved halfway through even the shooting incident could n't manage to hold my interest because it was resolved so quickly well i did n't bother to finish it i have limited time for reading and i do n't like to waste it	18
0	it is a very dry book and hard to stay interested in i am barely able to stay awake while reading it it does have some interesting things	18
0	well you know the rest aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired these meals cannot be done in 30 minutes unless that is if you want everything half cooked the book makes false promises and does not deliver there are also no pictures and no index and the recipes are very confusing most of them deriving from an original master recipe and then just changing one or two things if you want good food and a good cook book do n't buy into the hype and do n't buy this book	18
0	very seldom do i give up on a book i gave up on this one after several attempts to finish i have read barbara delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books i remember the fascination with the peyton place grace metalious hoopla in the 50 's and 60 's so i was expecting to enjoy this story it is dull and tiresome	18
0	no one alive today cares that ny had fires in 1741 \( unlike the chicago fire of 1871 \) why did author lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident is she trying to create trouble \? be a traitor to her own race \? book is well researched i guessbut the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up ! totally unnecessary !	18
0	i found the book had some ideas that helped but it was unrealistic in many ways i am spiritual but i did n't appreciate the religious opinion it gave	18
0	american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her	18
0	same ole same ole just another way for her to make a buck shame	18
0	i'm a fan of dave barry i enjoy his column i enjoyed some of his books in the past and i bought this one with great anticipation boy was i disappointed ! the story is meaningless the characters are not interesting the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny do yourself a favor do not read this book ! i ca n't believe anyone recommends it	18
0	after anticipating the arrival of this book \( that i ordered some time before publication after hearing of it \) i was disappointed although the subject is timely the writing style smacks of academia and therefore will not appeal to the mainstream \( reader \) because i'm tenacious by nature i finished the book but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention too bad it could have been inspirational	18
0	i am a big catherine coulter fan but this book is awful you can skip all the soap scenes a waste of space much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat do n't waste the 6 borrow from the library if you want to read	18
0	why use 1 word when 12 will bewilder the reader and make the book that much thicker i can not believe that a qualified editor reviewed this book the wheat to chaff ratio is horrendous you can go whole paragraphs without coming upon anything worth knowing i can only hope that the actual cisa exam questions are not written as poorly as the sample questions within this book if you value your time do not buy this book	18
0	the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation why could the equation not be solved \? there is a reason for this fact and the mathematical theory explains it well but not this book perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book but apparently not in this one	18
0	i bought bead fantasies and bead fantasies ii at the same time after reading the positive reviews i wish i had looked at these books before buying there are pretty motifs that i will incorporate into my beading projects but i find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small i'm glad this is n't my first beading book or i would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects i wo n't be buying bead fantasies iii the art and elegance of beadweaving and coraling technique remain my favorite beading books	18
0	i love other preston childs books so i thought i would love this one i did n't it is completely predictable i was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists but there were none and parts of it were ridiculous the length of the entombment the amount of the treasure the manner of transport etc the only character i really liked was the monkey	18
0	col mike martin raised in iraq speaks fluent arabic the taliban are pashtoon they are not arabs they do n't speak arabic they do n't even like arabs very much they are a totaly closed tribal society i spent a year living and working with the pashtoon in 2005 in helmand province there are no members of the taliban who are not pashtoon the other ethnic groups in afghanistan the tajik and the hazara are opposed to the taliban mike martin would not have the correct family clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off sorry but forsythe has dropped the ball on this one	18
0	while it 's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination deconstructionism by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is of course inhabited by people who read and people who write this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone	18
0	the author had a great idea but he cherry picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense for example superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2 two jewish guys right at the end of ww2 write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b c it 's destroyed etc etc i'm not critiscizing this book b c it has a religious message i'm critiscizing it b c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement otherwise i disagree with anybody that says it is just a comic superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america	18
0	if you have kids or grandkids who think about politics like sf give them this book ! it was one of the many heinlein works that helped me grow up it is the best most important of his for kids novels i ment to give it 5 stars ! ! ! !	18
0	i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one sided book i 've ever read it was n't about the crimes it was about this author 's personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos he has a real problem with women lesbians in particular he made ms wuornos out to be someone she was n't she had a hard life yes and chose to committ crimes but that was n't what this book was about again it was n't worth the i actually threw my copy of this away	18
0	i found this book to be very disappointing ms conant and her heroine were both suffering from memory loss with this book not up to her usual standard	18
0	the plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is \? we know where the precious document is another useless quest people are murdered by the half dozen the characters are outrageous most of the time improbable and i felt the semi erotic swimming episode totally stupid not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it i have read much better books than that sorry	18
0	thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we 're reading a story we like to look for clues in what we 've read to help us unravel the plot and find out who did it and why the crime was done john grisham cheats us out of that fun the villian of this book is n't introduced until there less than 75 pages left which means that when you get that far you realize that everything you read before then was n't valid to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings \? that 's bad read another thriller instead of this one one that plays by the rules	18
0	this is one of the dullest chick lit derivatives of the ya ya sisterhood and their adventures or misadventures it is full of misery poorly developed characters and is so formulaic that i predicted the outcome after about 50 pages at which point i could no longer stomach these ego driven falsely sweet dolts do n't waste your money	18
0	i bought this book because i was looking for some alternatives to pb j both of my children are now attending peanut free tree nut free schools this book has lots of ideas but too many of them are variations of the peanut butter sandwich	18
0	grisham 's worst book by far 90 of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys it would be ok if that was woven into a good story but it is not for great grisham read the firm and the partner for very good read runaway jury and pelican brief all of these are page turners street lawyer is a stomache turner really bad what happened	18
0	i have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly there are a lot of good books out there dan harrington 's the very best but this isnt one of them too much ego here and not enough helpful information	18
0	i was so disappointed in this book i do n't find a closeness to god in the pages instead it seems intellectual it contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with god face to face even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal god i seek and though the author 's prayers are included too i feel the same about them i expected more from richard j foster	18
0	book contains many useful lists charts comparisons to define giftedness many helpful hints about raising a gifted child main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general and may push those with quot normal quot kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track when they should not gifted kids are the exception not the norm as this book makes it seem	18
0	i was expecting new and interesting ideas from this book but was disappointed if you truly have no idea how to find a sales baseline for your business or do n't know how to track trends this book is for you if you are like me \( you know the basics but were trying to find a more thorough approach \) i would n't buy the book	18
0	you can breeze through this book in under an hour i just did while it makes for a suspenseful albeit entertaining account of what happened that infamous night damore relies too heavily on witnesses' accounts and police remarks \( often little more than kennedy bashing \) by now most of us can accept the facts that emk drank way too much and drove off a bridge subsequently leading to tragedy dui accidents happen every day chillingly often to average people the fact that this happened to one of the greatest senators in the history of the united states only reaffirms this	18
0	it 's a long read the characters are boring and the ending makes no sense at all it is neither funny nor thrilling it 's just plain dull	18
0	i had to read this book as part of a masters level class on organizational management i would offer it up for sale but i intend to burn it when class is over unless you want to read a book written by people who are so much better than you are \( he said with an extra helping of sarcasm \) do yourself a favor and skip this book it a bunch of religous self righteous fairy tale dogma horrible horrible book will look nice when it 's burnt to a crisp however	18
0	i was not impressed with this book it 's worth reading only because there are so few ruby on rails books there is too much basic ruby and not enough rails in this book i much prefered the agile web dev with rails	18
0	i really thought i would be able to learn about the philadelphia project from this book considering the title however the actual project does n't make an appearence until the last chapter the entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place this book was disappoiting to an extreme	18
0	this novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries in between the entertainment biz cliches the author can only think to put various assination hits some of the characters are interesting but not believable and they certainly ca n't make up for the braindead plot read some of his other novels and skip this one	18
0	this book is outdated for the 21st century the basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today	18
0	i might have been expecting too much but i was disappointed with this book i did not learn anything on dark magick per se the first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like goths vampires lost souls the collective unconscious dark deities satanism and some other stuff the second half is about magick but it sounds more like high magick to me where 's the dark magick	18
0	this book disappointed me after reading martins letters although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity there are much better books on analysing companies i suggest financial statement analysis by martin fridson and fernando alvarez	18
0	i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget i was wrong instead it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands on all kinds of architectural extravagances perhaps this book could have a subtitle how to spend a million dollars on a 1 500 square foot house if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply this is the wrong book	18
0	i see where this would be appealing to sum i just never got it oh well	18
0	i must say i was dissapointed with those 2 stories first story is so far from reality \( i know i know sometimes we want to get away but not that far ! ! ! \) i could n't read even half of the 2nd story it was written very poorly sometimes i felt like something just was n't enough at times opposite like it was way too much ! anyway i would n't recomend bying this book	18
0	this is j a jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations does n't help	18
0	the content of this book is adequate but the layout leaves much to be desired the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents pages are not labeled with chapter information such as which chapter that page belongs to the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book i would rate it much higher	18
0	very disappointing as well as boring ! ! generalities of little help have seen simple cheap books with better ideas and tips the writer might be a grandmaster but this will not help othercreatures forget about this book	18

0	this book is out of rint for one reason it is terrible i am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says she blames p amp g for the destruction of the environment mistreating employees the role of women in society and racism p amp g has done many things wrong most big companies have but it is not the cause of the fall of western society	18
0	the author keeps referring to the lds church as a cult by definition a cult is a religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian charismatic leader in christ 's day many would have considered his movement \( christianity \) a cult by definition and now it 's the largest religious form of worship in the world so let mormons do their thing there 's upwards of 12 000 000 of them now so i guess they 're not a cult anymore	18
0	i am an avid reader and could not make it through this book his other books were so good i could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be in applying some of the recommended techniques my 11 year old daughter emily thought i lost my mind thank goodness things are back to normal we are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice	18
0	as a student of urban development and politics i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that by employing simply economic analysis does not allow for the intricacies of the city 's problems class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel	18
0	i had to buy this book for a class it is an extremely boring read and i struggle to keep myself awake while reading it \( as does the rest of the class i am told \) it does tell you about dreamweaver though and i suppose that is its purpose one thing that i do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing internet explorer and other isp 's his personal opinions are a real turn off and unnecessary	18
0	i lived in france i know plenty of fat french women and french women who drink hard liquor every day and french women who drink coffee more than just in the morning french women do n't have the market on thinness by any means people all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits the author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on and her dropping of french phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying nothing new in this book eat less exercise more	18
0	definitely not one of his best ! slow slow slow but at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language unlike the hero of the partner who learned a little known spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks	18
0	f this self help industry crap quasi astrological poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack man warrior female maiden title what 's his name gives them and remember this doctor is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives so why do you \? let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self help industry to the torch that 's a great start to a sane life	18
0	clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is an endorsement of ethnic cleansing if the tables were turned and a jew or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s t i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth ! !	18
0	we have to use this book for the college class that i'm taking and it is a horrible book i often find myself looking for help on the internet rather than going to this book it is poorly organized i have to go to the index in order to find something i specifically need because the book is n't in any order i would n't recommend this book to anyone find another there are many more	18

0	i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did	18
0	pretentious and boring too clever for its own good the only good chapters in this book are the ones about pontius pilate and jesus christ and there 's not enough of that and this was the michael glenny translation	18
0	just to make the plot work not very realistic if you want a realist cop character try michael connelly 's harry bosch	18
0	i agree with some of the negative reviews that the junie b jones books often use language and depict behavior that are less than desirable my son who is a pretty sensitive boy did n't like junie b jones because he thought she was rude i would much prefer that my kids read books with kids who though they may get in trouble from time to time or may make mistakes are generally nice people we did love the magic tree house series both for the adventure and the personalities of jack and annie	18
0	i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts but i did n't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments as i was flipping through the book i found x rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back	18
0	as a lecturer of e commerce i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted	18
0	as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction however midway it turns into a romance novel i give it 3 stars for holding my attention a good beach read that can get you thinking \( a little \) about a time past the one star is a mistake and i cannot seem to change it 3 stars	18
0	i bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new fodor 's is n't out yet this has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations but is n't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins the maps are not comprehensive enough \( the one for modern jerusalem did n't cover a third of the city and the one for tel aviv was tiny \) and there is not enough practical information about food hotels and getting from place to place i was disappointed	18
0	i tried as hard as i could but just could not get into this book not quite as bad as her book impossible but close danielle steel is getting so repetitive in her writing basically this book repeated over and over how much quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he did n't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying dead drivel she could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves but no a waste of time very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all disappointing to say the least	18
0	i 've heard this book on tape which poor writing aside is more horrifying to actually hear o'reilly read in his own voice the gratuitous sex \( which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels \) is enough to turn anyone off but that voice narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure a sad sad example of narcissism at it 's very worst	18
0	this book was written in 1982 updated in 1995 it has a whole section on cameras which is n't useful since most of them are outdated does n't even mention digital cameras since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras i found this book to be disappointing	18
0	this book was very boring details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating this book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it a poll was taken and about 73 of the students in the school liked this book what does that show about the book \?	18
0	i have been slogging through this book for weeks now it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium the book lacks any narrative thrust often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to set the record straight and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its barbaric european contemporaries	18
0	cruel horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot the abuse of children evil ranger poising as a dead ranger freaky religious sect dead animals on the bed and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me i 've read many barr books and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters it 's hard to keep them straight in this book that was the last of my worries i did n't even finish it i was so turned off	18
0	it starts out like laura bush 's rules for driving but skydives after the opening pages in which the then 17 year old laura kills a young man with her car who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend ! my interest in the book sharply dove after that as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about laura bush	18

0	i had high hopes for this book there are too many parts that feel self serving and pointless i felt like i was reading the author 's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation the material on ideo could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader i found the preface by one of the author 's former professors to be the best part of the book i would not recommend buying this book	18

0	i thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself however the truth is you need money to invest in real estate so there 's really no way around it which made her book redundant she just gave examples of 3 people with 3 different investment strategies in the end the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth i really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties	18
0	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18

0	watson and crick pilfered the data of rosalind franklin \( unbeknownst to her \) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double helix nature of dna instead of acknowledging her with praise watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working \( ie a woman working in male dominated science n the 1950 's \) a classic case of reaction formation maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships	18

0	very poor book realy a waste of time the review below said it all	18
0	the book is obviously well researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting however the author included a lot of details that just really did n't matter as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book my professor was able to bring dr schrag to talk to our class he was a good lecturer keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style i think he would have much more success as an author	18
0	ed klein is really so desperate in his attack that he ca n't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against hillary ! what a lot of misinformation and outright lies to actually accuse marian wright edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal and to insinuate that chelsea was the result of a rape even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant is disgusting i should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were monica lewinsky !	18
0	the topic of this book is very interesting espionage in the revolutionary war unfortunately washington 's spies goes into so much nit picking detail that as the cliche goes you ca n't see the forest for the trees to really get anything out of this book you 'd have to be a very dedicated revolutionary war buff it did n't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader	18
0	you get your money 's worth here there are a ton of cds in this audio book unfortunately i found bryson 's prose \( which i enjoyed a lot when reading silently as i have done with his other books \) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud to me he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts and sometimes there is a sort of moist sound when he pronounces words hard to describe until you hear the cd but trust me on this one i think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book and not the cd i would stick with the written word on this one	18
0	this is another piece of lowbrow anti german propaganda dressed as historiography the book is a mess of primary yet selective and biased historical research simplistic psycho babble ridiculous sociological anthropological speculation pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least absolutely third rate military history the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives all in all cheap trash billed as history	18
0	a book full of heartwarming stories from country stars singers writers and listeners or so the back of the book said as i read some sentimental stories and some down right boring stories i questioned how more than half of these stories got into the `country1 edition of the chicken soup series i loved about three stories liked about ten and was puzzled by all the other entries	18
0	i have a hard time believing that the author has ever seen an episode of tng i had to force myself to finish this book it was so bad by far the worst star trek book i have ever read if you want a good one read 'federation' and stay as far away from this one as you can	18
0	i was so upset after i finished reading this book i wish it was n't updated and they just kept it in its original version if you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values this is the wrong book read bushido the soul of japan the code of the samurai really felt like the code of the japanese business man	18
0	i 'll be blunt i did n't care for this book i bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the gnostic sophia instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions her i really think the title was misleading as a sidenote lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of gnosis	18
0	this book bears litthe relevance to the 'original' fourth edition book of the same name there is no coordination with the text most of the concepts are explained in terms of economics not computer science i have to wonder if the whole idea is a gross mistake or a scam i feel cheated	18
0	this book was fun to look at but not really usable lots of stylized drawings and self aggrandizing tales by the author and not a lot of realistic how to also the explanations about skin care were clearly not written by anyone with a science or medical background	18
0	in the chapter about south asia the authors have written quite a lot about the quot kashmir problem quot but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350 000 kashmiri hindus that took place in 1990 i just cannot believe that they do n't know about this	18
0	i was hoping the book would be good most reviews are however the topics are not really covered at all more introduced it was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing they openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english just as well long rambling thaughts that do n't form conclusions not what i wanted or needed it actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go	18
0	i enjoy reading sports fiction with my 10 year old son the descriptions of this book suggested it addressed important themes which transcended basketball however as i read the book i found the treatment of those themes quite superficial in addition the book was bawdy while it may accurately reflect locker room mentality many readers may not find that mentality entertaining it is not an appropriate book for children	18
0	i do n't really understand all the reviews about sun tzu 's work people saying that this one or that one is closer to the original are there really that many experts in ancient chinese out there how can anyone say which is the best translation unless they are personally familiar with the original in the original chinese and if that the case they should write their own version	18
0	i have listened to a bunch of dean koontz books while listening to the second one i saw so many similarities which really turned me off and this flaw continued which each book i listen to which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book however most of the stories were pretty good so i stuck with him this is not the case with this book cold fire is absolutely horrible i so regret purchasing this book it is so bad that i have decided to swear off dean for looooooooong while just on a side note the bad place is the first dk book i read and it was very entertaining	18
0	this book refers to philosophical basis of buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion it is not a manual nor a guide no meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book the style is simbolic and poetical it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content it will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work	18
0	i did not like the book adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters i also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father i shall bla bla bla	18
0	this book is not about india or indians shallow characters non existant plot a dismal end to a not terrible beginning unlike one of the other reviewers i was unlucky enough to buy this book what a waste	18
0	the instruction manual in eq2 is quite addiquate regardless of class things you are not sure of are learned as you go or you can post on numerous forums for answers since there are stats on top of stats and such vast areas with tons and tons of resources and itesm to be had this book helps you get an idea of the where and what as in where you may find x or what y actually does and realated stats its a reference guide but as this game is so dynamic this book has a limited lifspan and as you develop in the world you will find it to be old news rather quickly	18
0	ok this book is funny the first time you look through it ! ! ! overall i would not recomend this book because it 's one of those books that you 'll just look through one time and one time only ! yeah there are a lot of positions but they are all repeated in the book like five times with different names ! and another thing there are a lot of positions that are not even posible and some only with a giant swing or how about a horizantal or verticle pole yeah many people have those in their houses but seriously the only positions that you'll be able to do are the ones that you know already ! !	18

0	filled with bizarre generalizations and the most pretentious phraseology i 've seen in years this book has the dubious honor of spotlighting all that has gone wrong in academic research in this country in the last 20 years jodi dean shows an appalling lack of understanding of the workings of culture history politics or even writing style it seems she should have spent more time with turabian 's manual for writers than surfing the web or watching sienfeld	18
0	there is only one 100 whole grain bread recipe in this book most of them are less than 50 whole grain if you want healthy bread recipes try breadtime by cheney or the laurel 's kitchen bread book by robertson every recipe in both of those books is 100 whole grain i doubt that most people considering a book titled whole grain breads are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients with that being said i thought the book had some good recipes and was well written therefore i am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none	18
0	i was disappointed in this book the art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a tv craft show i would instead recomment robert wade 's watercolor book	18

0	i enjoyed the parts regarding the s s valiant but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me except for picard who we of course know quite well from the series the other characters were flat and uninteresting we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy of the week boring the whole quot adversarial quot situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard	18
0	i'm an electrical engineer and in the telecomm buisness i 've read a lot of books on communications and this has to be one of the worst luckily i did n't pay for it the writing is poor and it does n't commuicate ideas clearly there is better books out there on the exact same subject	18

0	reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it for one thing the author still talks about the ussr and east germany and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated it 's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future	18
0	disappointed as an english teacher i expected a more compelling and less hokey use of whitman the first story of the deformed whitman loving boy was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging	18
0	i have always been a prolific reader and rarely do i come across a book for which i can find no value no redeeming qualities but i must extend a hearty congratulations to julia barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement i have ever had the misfourtune to purchace teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense if you are like me and just have to read it just because you 're obsessed with austen buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it	18

0	other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit picking and general vindictiveness of this book i agree with these criticisms but i'm not going to revisit them here the deeper problem lies with the ayn rand institute which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ari 's party line as long as the ayn rand institute refuses full unconditional scholarly access to miss rand 's papers any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice nor should they be	18

0	i m not a big fan of communism nor of stalin but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war dont waste your money on a propaganda book better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer thats what biographies are supposed to be	18
0	i wanted to like this book but was very disappointed that all it included was a mish mash of vanity fair articles from 1990 2002 with follow up paragraphs that appear to be right out of people magazine	18
0	do you know how clever alan trachtenberg is \? i mean do you really really know \? ! because if not this book is for you trachtenberg 's book is only superficially about indians or americans it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things because he is very clever you know in so far as this book has a thesis that it is it	18

0	cooper 's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager of a real company it contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories along with trite sayings such as quot when you find a back door that 's open close it quot or my personal favorite quot use the lanterns of your life to help light the way quot if you 're looking for an inspirational book one with a solid basis forget this one you 'd be better off reading the daily horoscope	18
0	i liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena however i found it weak on issues facing companies today in china or that the new business economy has created there was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing china in its transition the journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me i disagree with the simplistic conclusion \( among others \) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in china	18

0	i must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of shakespear 's world and plays they are very good and intertaining but i must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations \( in detail \) of people having sex the book is probably very good if you like reading text books and do n't mind these pictures but i was just too grossed out if you are teaching lit in college and or studying shakespeare this is probably the book that you should use but you should flip through the book first \( i e library book store \) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves	18
0	this book explains very well the growing paranoia of modern parents this is a resolute attack against parenting determinism it is regrettable however that the author 's references are not more scientific than those he reproaches to parenting determinism advocates of using moreover he is not far from praising spanking which is proven very bad for children	18

0	i was interested in dante 's thoughts on hell religion and the afterlife as taught by the catholic church at the time of its writing what i got was a detailed political history of medieval italy this book is great for the first few chapters but then it becomes a repetitive saga synopsis of the each chapter of the inferno go to next layer of hell describe in 20 words or less the torture found there make fun of some political opponents catholic church officials and so forth prepare for further descent in my opinion this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell canto three pretty much has it right 'leave all hope ye that enter	18

0	i must agree with my 1 star friend this book does n't deliver it spends all this time talking about things that we could grasp just by looking in the help section of the program it goes over basic things several times and makes it sound very complicated when it is totally simple this book is good for people who have alot of time to waste and money	18
0	this is not a good study guide for an employment law class too basic and general this may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring firing etc but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney	18
0	uninspired and unsatisying the writing style is austinesque but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not margaret 's motives and emotions are obscure and the author 's assertion that her quot heroine quot has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed quite the contrary	18
0	this novel could not hold my interest i am an anne perry fan but could not get into this book i could n't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting i'm really disappointed because i was looking forward to a new series by her joseph and matthew lost their parents to murder and joseph lost two close friends to murder yet there did n't seem to be much emotion maybe ms perry tried to tell too many stories within one story in reviewing the book it 's hard to pin point exactly why i did n't like this book i would skip this series and read the pitt series	18
0	18 jun 2005as the book progressed it got more and more egoistic to the point where it becomes a turn off towards the end of the book i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem shaq 's attitude seems to be that since he can score he does not respect centers who ca n't score whereas he respect bill russell but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq so this is a big improvement	18
0	please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature read this book yourself before giving it to your child it discusses oral sex anal sex how to use and purchase condoms masturbation \( for girls and boys \) etc when the author discusses exploring your own sexuality she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth as she would have stopped sucking her thumb the cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within it is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve for many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate	18
0	a great resource for first time and experienced importers who do not fully understand their responsibilites as an importer	18
0	i found this book vacuous and jejune and frankly i met the author \( without knowing who he was \) and he tried to pick me up and i 've never heard such a pile of cr in my life and i'm not even close to beautiful so good luck with his advise	18
0	i must have missed something about this book i ca n't believe that minority report and total recall two movies that i did enjoy came from this author the stories seem to be missing something perhaps this version should not have been the first works by this author for me to have read	18
0	you get a view into 60 's white america the only people of color in this book are a policeman and a caricature i do n't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe this is set in everyday life and i think its best left on the bookshelf it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair not to mention various shades of skin colour the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one dimensional quot white quot depiction of the world	18
0	this book is trying too hard to emphasize in being funny it is filled with mediocre 'funny' patters that the readers are encouraged to use but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor balancing two forks on the edge of a glass should not be considered magic once you read a few samples the reading becomes stifling knowing that you are not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot teach you some areas are brighter the photos are clear and it blends magician bios and history within but one can do better with other books around	18
0	this book is best used for viewing its selection of master drawings many of which are superb however its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo intellectualizations it should be noted that this book was not written by hale it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of hale 's classic drawing lessons from the great masters instead this book loses itself in unimportant erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle confuse frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader it greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory	18
0	too much wrong information in the text photo captions hit or miss altogether unreliable take your needs elsewhere	18
0	a little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better ms cantrell spends the majority of the book being a relationship marriage counselor and though it 's true issues become larger in smaller spaces there are more issues for women cruisers than just their relationship dynamics as i said practical logistical information would have suited me better	18
0	i did n't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are i am disappointed that the notes are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation rather key terms are defined and that is all	18
0	ms wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of literary criticism or a biography the book suffers from too much critical analysis of sassoon 's poetry and not enough about his life either he was an extremely boring and prosaic poet or ms wilson needs to delve deeper into his intellectual and emotional development really his cricket exploits and his hunting prowess does not lend anything to the very essence of his life ms wilson 's prose is turgid and repetitive an extremely disappointing work	18
0	this book is a cure for insomnia if i ever have trouble falling to sleep i 'll just dig out my old flatland book and i 'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later ! listening to the a square character telling us about his flat two dimensional world is not thought provoking its just confusing ! trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing i mean i understand what flatland would be like but only after i carefully think out what mr square is saying i spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of flatland than i do enjoying the story not very interesting at all even two stars is being generous	18
0	this is a nice small book to take along in the car but i do n't think the pictures are animated enough my 19 month old son does n't seem too interested in the book	18
0	many words few practical tips ! this book did not give much more \( valuable \) information than i already had found out by reading the manual delivered with my pocket computer after reading the book i still had to search for web communities where some of my questions could be answered my expectations when buying the book were mainly focused on the need for practical hints concerning how to manage tasks contacts and appointments unfortunately in my view these important and basic issues were treated too superficially	18
0	i'vc had this book since i was 7 years old i loved the awesome photos of echanis doing his thing if you like the elaborate and complex then this is the knife fighting book for you there are simpler ways of getting it done but few are more fun to try and by the way if any of you are curious as to how he died he was killed while training in nicaragua hmmm	18
0	this book is perfunctory and extremely shallow russell 's reductive reading of the tradition shows little insight however it is amusing at times hence the star	18
0	the first novel written by stephenson and it 's a satire on college dorm life pointless rambling and bizarre it 's a good thing he 's improved his writing over the years as this one stunk	18
0	am i the only person that felt this book was twisted disjointed and something was just not working \? the beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired this could have been a great story the author veered off track or something	18

0	do not buy this book this author belives that he can cure dyslexia with his mind 's eye you can not cure dyslexia you just have to learn a different way from the norm with the right tools such as an orton gillingham based program i bought this book by mistake not looking carefully at the author	18

0	was given this book as a freebie someone must be buying up copies for an austinite this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth string techno celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when louis the xiv 's chamber pot was carried by except this is n't the sun king guys get a life or at least an authentic artist to swoon over all of garriott 's stuff was strictly derivative now that we have the real lord of the rings to watch who cares about cheap imitations	18
0	this book was a huge disappointment not only was n't it funny to me it has absolutely nothing funny for kids too bad its not worth the return shipping charges i threw it out	18
0	good book on deal structure but if you want a valuation number check out quot unlocking the value of your business quot	18
0	one at the front the really own words of the master are excellent one must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with bruce lee the rest consists of interviews with the former interviewers however as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune but the words of the master are absolutely worth while as already mentioned at the beginning	18
0	for the most part the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book 's printing but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms be warned there are several places where the book goes awry for example the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal occasionally hunting in pairs problem no tracks of a t rex have been discovered to date a decade and a half after the writing aside from that and a few other points though the book is good reading	18
0	this dictionary is just another long winded pretentious unreadable high brow attempt to legitimize anthropology the authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology if you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions forget this book	18
0	not easy for any beginner to use unless you knew exactly what kind of silver you were trying to identify i e english scottish irish etc it was a bit confusing marks are black amp white some not showing very good clarity and everything is in extremely in small print if you just want to sort through tons of marks and dates this may be for you if you want information about your piece pass it up	18
0	i 've been following bprd since the very beginning and feel that i can say with all sincerity that this series gets better and better with each new story ! the tpb 's are absolutely the way to go if you do n't frequent comic stores \( which i do \) so do yourself a favor and purchase all of the tpb 's kick back in an easy chair with a stock of time set aside and enjoy these bad boys to your hearts content	18
0	oh how i wanted to love devon 's book ! he was such a charming rascal in wicked and such a bore in sinful there was no meat to this story the back of the books summarizes it nicely what would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages i admit i only made through about half before skimming and realizing it was n't going to get any better there 's no sizzling tension the love scenes weak and the mystery is predictable i had such high expectations for this boscastle book since drake 's was brilliant and devon 's character seemed such a lovable rogue not a keeper for me	18
0	mr haqqani 's views about his mother country are very dubious the only question i have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner what has he done for his home land \? nothing ! ! ! this book in waste of time	18
0	this book expounds endlessly on how best to limit the impact of people on the backcountry in the very best traditions of the sierra club it 's more of a philosophy book than a quot how to quot book if anyone wants to learn how to backpack and or camp he would be better advised to buy the several books by karen berger and chris townsend in particular the backpackers handbook	18
0	the unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes dan brown look like borges in comparison naming characters guard one just shows you do n't even try to care the plot is so hair brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache i just learned to my horror that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times i 'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise but it 's been ruined forever by this somewhere baby jesus is crying	18
0	after reading a fine balance i could n't wait to read another book by this author i then read his third book called family matters which was good but i was disappointed as it by no means compared to a fine balance i just finished such a long journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots it is my least favorite of the three books by this author it 's hard to believe that someone can right a book like a fine balance which was magnificant and one of the best books i have ever read and then turn our stuff that is at best average	18
0	boring tasteless and unoriginal photographer has an obvious fixation which has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast tone and line one star for the big you know what the real model here i'm sure book has its merits but they are n't artistic putting my copy up for sale	18
0	what to say about belarus \? well we spent the day the white russkis commemmorate the end of wwii there so i 've seen it in all of its grandeur not much to recommend it go and see belarus if you missed out on the post wwii east european dictatorships because belarus is the last of its kind a genuine personality cult around the president runs politics and you can get a feel for what it was like in 1970 's e europe guess what you will not like it take some pics of minsk move on to moscow and if you can find a decent hotel in minsk you 've done better than my wife and i did	18
0	it is fiction of course it can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is impossible ! many reviewers are upset upset perhaps but they should not be worried the church is protected by christ 's promise that it will not err any person of faith sees this book as fiction it is a poor attempt to disguise greely 's left wing theology as fiction the message to those liberals who find quot hope quot for their cause in this book it ain't going to happen recommended reading quot women priests and other fantasies quot greely and his followers are delusional	18
0	i was really looking forward to reading this book since i am both a brain researcher and a professional musician first it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted even this was sparse at best he attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it however it became too watered down and even lost me lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments pushing the envelope of science should be award enough for these reasons i can not recommend this book	18
0	at first glance this is a great book however once you 've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration the author illustrator and publisher should be ashamed of themselves we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children 's books as well \? this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind however	18
0	i 've seen much better photos articles on dylan and would not suggest this particular work i will be selling my copy in the used section	18
0	while it may have been well written this book is disturbing and disgusting to put it mildly if you or anyone you know are pregnant or contemplating or trying to have children do not read this book ! this is one book i can honestly say in retrospect i would rather have failed the test on than ever have read	18
0	chris bohjalian is a gifted stylist and it pains me to give this book such a low mark it 's hard to say much without giving away the plot but i found the plot contrived and manipulative too clever for its own good the book started strong but as the main character became more disassociated with reality i became more disassociated with the book i finished it but it was a struggle	18
0	i really want to like thich nhat hanh 's books i want to because people i respect like them because i believe in the value of mindful living but the truth is that i did n't find this book very helpful i have real and continuing struggles with anger and this book while interesting in a round about way is as others have mentioned not directed toward the problem of anger it is a mindful living remix i'm going to keep searching for a great tnh book and when i do i 'll recommend it good hunting	18
0	excellent how to technical reference easy to read and understand a must have book for those interested in biodiesel and or waste vegetable oil	18
0	this book looks like it was written by someone who works in their own garage as a hobby there is no real technical data in this book no hint of professionalism the photos are black and white and most of the time they do n't really show what the book is talking about there are no torque specs little detail or warnings on how things are done with the quality of this book you 're better off saving the 30 and pulling the jeep apart yourself to see how it works	18
0	i wouold only skim this book if you want a general idea about business marketing but do not expect in depth detail about how to truly market your business	18
0	this breviary is disappointing to traditional catholics ! novus ordo catholics will be right at home with this but if you are a traditional orthodox catholic who favors the roman rite and who has been traumatized by the profanations inflicted by iconaclastic innovations this is the same ole same ole vatican ii stuff	18
0	i admittedly have not completed the full book as it is thick however i do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for dfss for example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there does n't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems i therefore think the book is more about six sigma than dfss barry	18
0	camenson definitely has experience in this career with many quot career books quot to her credit however there are better books out there on writing with more information this book follows the same old tired format that vgm books are 'not so' famous for the internet has more info for a lot less money	18
0	the author gives vague advice the calm down be objective cliche advice if you do n't believe me i'm literally quoting him although the author tries to make his book seem original as you can read it 's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances but mixed with the generic advice i mentioned this is not something revolutionary this is rehash save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation you do n't need to read hundreds of pages to do it or spend on what to imagine	18
0	i started reading this book hoping for the best in turn i found that my hopes were n't fulfilled the beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more after the tone changed the book became bitter and boring the characters lost their flare and the whole book lost personality the book became dull and lost appeal to me the book 's writing style in the beginning was original and fun following the death of little red the book slowly fell apart leaving me tempted to stop reading the book if someone asked me to recommend a good book this would not be the one	18
0	i bought this book and was sorely disappointed nothing specific just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do you could do this yourself without a book	18
0	this book contains reproducible mini books bingo cards flash cards some word search puzzles and fill in activities in my opinion the fill ins are a bit too challenging i even had trouble with them the only thing in this book really worth it that i could n't make as well myself are the mini books the mini books each contain several different sight words so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them	18
0	no not really since this novella first appeared in harper 's some years back and then was the prologue in underworld this makes the third time it 's appeared in print and while it is brilliant why buy this when you can buy underworld for about the same price	18
0	his fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow there is some wisdom here and there but not worth the headache you 'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head here is an example if you say your own name to yourself at such a moment it will seem utterly alien you will then understand the sacrament of baptism huh \? at first i thought his writing may just be over my head but after re reading most of it i realized it was just bad it 's like the whole book was written when he was high or something some very good ideas but most can be found in other better written books	18
0	this is one of kellerman 's poorest books when you finally get to what is going on it is ridiculous do n't waste your time on this	18
0	i really love to get these for my wife surprises are best when i give them to her and she enjoys all of them from this great author but she and i were not happy when i thought i found another of this super special portal series \( having a new cover is nice but its a new publisher with nothing more than marketing in their minds really hated to say this but we all know her books are super great just know this is a reprint before you guy and like others get a little ticked its not new after you fork over the cash and get your hopes up ! peace everyone \) jeff	18
0	what i learned in this book could have been placed on 1 page sure business life is a challenge and your competitors are not your friends but this book did not deliver on facts and details i do n't see much difference between this book and the guru books	18
0	i cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews i have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst ! i am amazed that all the references to child murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers	18
0	i was quite disappointed by this book i was expecting something with more professional level content it 's all very amateur however the artwork used in the examples is sub professional at best i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific pre press issues relating to comics artwork but the chapter there was frustratingly slight you would be much better to buy a a more general pre press book the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much	18
0	this book has a volume number it is one of a series of monographs that have been published i am looking volume 231 but since you do n't mention the volume number i do n't know if this is the volume i'm seeking i will go elsewhere for my purchase	18
0	i can tell you first hand how amazon makes easy money i am a formal seller here at amazon not a big seller but an honest one with a 5 star rating and zero claims however amazon allows dishonest buyer 's to do chargebacks months after a purchase and then has nothing in place to assist seller 's in getting their merchandise back sounds like retail fraud to me ! ! i wish there was a lower rating to give to this website they are truly at the bottom !	18
0	i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details but also historical background because it 's an autobiography i do n't necessarily think that it 's fair to damn the book for being self centered it is about him i do feel however that the book needs better editing and a bit more self examination it 's an okay addition to one 's list of books about everest expeditions which i must admit i 've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re reading into thin air i would n't however use it as my primary source for information or impressions	18
0	ok you guys as i have stated this book let me down ! it practically ends on page 195 and there 's still 65 pages to go ! my advice do n't even start it also i tried the killer 's cousin i was n't pleased with that either so my conclusion if you 're looking for a good read do n't expect nanxy werlin to fulfill your needs if you need good suspenseful stories try lois duncan or caroline b cooney ! one great outstanding wonderful book swimmer graham masterton	18
0	this book was so simplistic i was quite disappointed you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all a worthy goal but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit he really held back from delving into any dark territory his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit he always managed to put a happy positive spin on everything which is nice but life is n't that simple	18
0	what a chore this book was to read if it were n't for my ocd about finishing books that i start i would 've read the first couple of chapters and then given up it seems like a wannabe suspense but it 's not it seems like there might be a love story in it but there 's not it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it but there is not what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she 's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy she tries to make a connection but falls way short read vinegar hill that one was worth it pass midnight champagne by	18
0	the plot in final analysis is trite and overused and the characters are flat and stock tedious and painful to read	18
0	i love the number one detective agency series and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales unfortunately there was no narrative flow making the stories stilted and un interesting maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped i suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable	18
0	i bought this book and also last night based upon the gushing reviews you see above who are they kidding \? the main character is a cad it is far from a tour de force in erotic anything his short stories in last night are only marginally better your time is better spent with other authors	18
0	if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman 's self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student	18
0	the text gets 5 stars for the orientation organization and the on line resources for the text it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course unfortunately i have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make this has been frustrating for my students as well as myself however i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market i strongly recommend a new corrected edition	18
0	i have introduced many of my ell high school students to lois lowery and the depth of her characters she is a brilliant writer and capable of inspiring fierce passion in her readers as they encounter shocking details of her utopian worlds i was anxious to read this companion novel and had planned to share it with my class this january although the series is written for 6th graders and older this book 's simplicity in its message language and writing style will inspire no one i am sadly disappointed	18
0	just know this book has you developing code in the sdk not visual studio net if anything that should turn you away from buying this any net programmer will be working with visual studio and not an sdk the sams teach yourself c in 24 hours was completely written for vs net so i am confused as to why this book was not get another book as this one will be only of use for terminology and oop theory it was a waste on money for me	18

0	this poorly executed story drags on for too long while the town waits for the return of sister north in the end we really do n't care if she ever returns the ending is cliched and predictable a waste of time	18
0	i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail it just does n't click for me i f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but i just cannot do it my self	18

0	i am so sorry that i bought this book it is unfortunate that you do not have a penguin or everyman 's library edition first of all the book is too large to read in bed secondly whoever did the proofreading should be fired there are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading if the postage were not so expensive from israel i would return the book to amazon	18
0	someone gave me this book as a gift why i have no idea this book is about as intelligent as a tv sitcom about as funny as a tv sitcom and generally at the level of a tv sitcom i found it neither funny inspiring nor interesting it is in the final analysis proof that any book that purports to be about quot strong quot or quot outrageous quot women will immediately sell thousands of copies regardless of the piffle between the covers and is thus a triumph of marketing over everything probably best for teenaged girls who do n't read much it 's no worse than tv i guess	18
0	this book \( i believe \) is one of lem 's earlier stories and it reads like so so pulp sci fi fiasco \( a true 5 star science fiction novel \) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better i suggest reading this only if you are a lem completist \( i 've read all of his stuff except 2 books \)	18
0	i looked through this book at a craft store the other day and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells i found maybe one project in here that i would consider making just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish i would n't recommend this book try to find decorating with seashells by anita louise cran	18
0	i have not read the original version of this work but the translation lacks originality and art a beautiful story but the writing style lacks grace and creativity this is the only time i have liked a movie better than the book do yourself a favor and skip the book the movie is quite beautiful and moving	18

0	this book is the worst book ever i did n't know there could possibly be a book this bad if you are required to read this book like me i feel bad for you do not read this book for pleasure because it is not a pleasant book it is painful to read if you are still thinking of reading this bad book don't read it ! ! take my advice	18
0	if you adore the intellect and see in it the only way to the highest purest and most divine knowledge than this is your book but it is n't mine page after page of speculation about the higher realms open only to a mind freed from the crude considerations of the flesh i kept hoping that plotinus would realize his vision and disappear before finishing but it did n't happen	18
0	frankly this book brings nothing new we already know everything there is to know about jackie and diana do n't we \? i sincerely regret having paid such a high price to read what i already knew ! i found the book quot mrs kennedy quot much much more interesting	18
0	the information is sketchy and factually incorrect in some places and the book would appear not to have been proof read for example the botanical names are mis spelled in several different ways there are much better books on the subject available	18
0	the book reads like a shallow way too long magasine article the shop seems to specialize in self help books so there 's hardly a literary feel to it the style too is annoying for example she writes that her dad was n't big on books i would have expected a slightly bigger vocabulary then that	18
0	this book started off very good but as i read on the reading became ardious i found it hard work to finish this book i do n't know why i had such a hard time enjoying the book while all the other reviewser thought it was the best thing since sliced bread but i would read another shark book such as shark trouble or close to shore rather than waste my time on this book	18
0	i am extremely dissapointed with this new edition of the text and have one advise only if you own 2nd ed do not indulge in this new edition for even the errors \( spellings for one \) are xeroxed onto the new edition therefore for a review of the text itself you may without any compunction refer to 2nd ed 's comments of which there are many	18
0	this is another wierd book by shirley maclaine it is neither interesting nor a helpful guide book for pilgrims the book is just a long rambling new age rant published because the auther is shirley maclaine too bad really do n't waste your money on this one	18
0	although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa i find this book difficult to understand the difficulty seems to come from the authors' desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages this leads to a cryptic language where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words a thing which personally frustrated me	18
0	do you like romance novels \? do you call your dogs your babies \? this is the book for you the thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge this was my first johansen novel and it most certainly will be my last two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends	18
0	i tried i really did but i could n't get beyond 100 pages i love iris johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one almost as if she were forced to do so it contained none of her usual style the dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters i'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical ij style	18
0	i would like to know what kind of a wuss needs to use a stradegy guide for a first person shooter ! \? i mean they 're pretty straightfoward walk forward and kill all the bad guys you see ! how hard is that ! \? halo is an awesome game but it 's really not hard to figure out what to do ! i mean you 'd have to be a complete moron not to know what to do or where to go it tells you more than once what to do during the game you got that extrememly annoying cortana yacking in your ear pretty much non stop tellin' ya what to do but anyway i'm done ranting at you wusses	18

0	if you want the why and the wherefore stay away informative to general audiences it provides little scientific support for its contention with the wealth of information out there this was not the critical review needed nor was it terribly informative about any particular statin caused effect	18
0	many of the columns were interesting painting a picture of a vast right ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete without any interest either as themselves or as a theme does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989 or phil gramm 's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate \? someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read	18

0	i visit england frequently i have an earlier edition of this book which i find to be very useful even now the new version leaves out a lot of the good places that were in the old book and it lacks credibility i have a hard time taking any of it seriously when it tells me that an english pint is 16 ounces anyone who is serious about english beer knows that an english pint is 20 ounces	18
0	with someone like this teaching you a failing grade is the likely outcome why dunn feels it neccessary to quote from one of shakespeare 's most ridiculus plays and behave as if he is possessed is beyond me it 's not funny or necessary and the problem is that the book is full of it literally if you are looking to learn the solid fundementals of chemistry you should pass this one by and go with something like wiley 's chemistry concepts and problems in which you begin learning immediately in a simple straightforward manner for anyone to suggest that a book like this should be part of any school 's curriculum is just absurd	18
0	the professionals in the law field in this book are n't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become i understand not everyone becomes a six figure paid lawyer right out of law school but this book is ridiculous it shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk \? give me a break	18
0	the text is ok and the way the story is cut up in frames and assembled is competent but the drawings are the work of a hack often tacky and always styleless and garishly colored the costumes and settings are totally lacking in imagination and carry no semantic weight the attempts to create a visual equivalent for the musical leitmotifs of the operas are too literal and very much in the spirit of a mechanical translation from opera to comic book an affront to connoisseurs of either opera or comics or both only valuable as a kitschy curiosity	18
0	the writing was not what i expect of andre norton too many gaps and information that is disjointed whether this is a consequence of collaboration i do n't know i felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened for example at the start we know kirion has sent people to capture his sister the book covers over 2 years but you hardly hear of this again i cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop i am a long time fan and retired children 's librarian sic fi fantasy is my favorite genre but this one i had to push to finish unsatisfying	18
0	wow ! i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book luckily i got it out of the library did n't buy it i liked it at first but then the situations got more more implausible then i was reading it just to laugh at it some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too if i had the book here at work with me maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes not a well written book at all in my humble opinion glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway	18
0	i have read other books by alesia holliday and enjoyed them so i looked forward to reading this book unfortunately i could not get any farther than the first 25 pages i even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and i still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away the best i can do to pin down why i dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard no character seems to even approach reality they are all including the main character and her love interest over the top	18
0	this booklet has a lot of warner brothers drawings but it does n't delve into the specifics of creating animation very well i 'd recommend getting the animator 's survival kit instead as it has tons of good and well explained info on the art of creating your own animation	18

0	not even worth finishing this book ! this author does not know enough to even write this book ! i have personal connections with blackwater and i know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be it is a one sided story not based on facts which it what most writers do but purely fiction ! the only few misfortunes blackwater has had is what he bases his book on not the postive stories that i hear about everyday do n't waste your money	18

0	this book was written in the '80s was copy written in 1990 it has a folksy tone and some technical information unless you are buying your church 's sound system at a second hand store this book is going to leave you wondering what might be available today for example cd recorders are under development	18
0	i'm very disappointed in this book although some information in it is valuable it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find ideas for what you need although broken into sections they are not readily found or visible one must search the information needed as in a research assignment the reproducibles are mainly for elementary grades this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it 's contents on line although the price was reasonable i'm not pleased with the way the book is organized amp printed	18
0	this book offers more information about santa claus than it does the gods godesses associated with the winter soltice the craft projects are cheesey and the recipes terrible save your money and do a little research yourself and if you want recipes or craft projects pick up one of those special christmas magazines for ideas you can adapt for a pagan holiday theme	18
0	this book is poor it 's not quot philosophical quot in any sense because it 's not logical and it 's not supported by the majority of music scholars today reimer contradicts himself at every turn he does n't understand what langer is really saying and his absolutist notion of music is completely out of synch with what most scholars argue about music today reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy feel good nonsense	18
0	suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic to refer to rabbi david berger 's book the rebbe the messiah amp the scandal of orthodox indifference	18
0	the book appears to give comprehensive coverage in terms of the number and type of entries included however on the atkins diet the important measure to monitor is the quot active quot carbohydrate mass which may metabolised and which excludes roughage or fiber the inclusion of such a measure in the book would greatly enhance its value and utility	18
0	two huge problems with this book one this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and traveling and learning when they already know his identity so i guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass two the city of los angeles functions as a character in kellerman 's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels this thing drags on in some unnamed nondescript city	18
0	it 's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting written with blatant self promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout truly basic and nothing new here spend your money elsewhere	18
0	this book is very dissapointing sure this book is full of information but does not know how to teach this book is not completely written in step by step method before you actually start touch your project you are fed up with information i even found a couple of mistakes in earlier chapter dvd comes with this book but this dvd is not a lesson project like apple pro training series not useful if you are beginner and start studying dvd studio pro 4 do n't by this book ! you 're going to waste your money buy the one from apple pro training series which is much better easy to understand	18

0	this is the worst textbook i have ever bought for any class ! it is a huge waste of money and super frustrating to read this book is horribly written the explanations are boring drawn out and unclear the early chapters draaaag on forever the later chapters get a little better but they state a lot of obvious or useless information i have spent hours and weeks studying from this text and learned very little	18
0	i was also disappointed with evanovich 's latest book if i read this book not knowing who the author was i would have guessed it was written by her it 's amazing how many of the character 's actions and spoken words are strikingly similar to the plum series agree that the pugg character is really annoying ! ! i am a huge evanovich fan and have read most of her non plum books but would have to say this is my least favorite looking forward to the 13th plum in june	18
0	ugh i did not even try to finish the book it is full of sexual content not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature	18

0	melrose larry green 's book is full of quotes quotes and information used to back up points are good things he appears to have researched by surfing the internet watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others this is all fine and acceptable the problem with why the clintons belong in prison is when the author \( cut and paste expert \) attempts his own narrative which is sporadic jumpy and poorly edited his points are not linear and show the author 's attention deficit with a proper literary team this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a hit and run report and reads like a one sided sensationalized talk radio program	18
0	yuck this book was totally boring well maybe you 'll like it if you 're like 7 or 8 years old or something not only is it totally boring but poorly written which surprised me because ann m martin is certainly not a bad writer ! i'm really glad she left the bsc and started writing a new series about them the bsc books are soo boring and childish please a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog runs loose for 2 seconds do n't waste your time reading the bsc books they are all pretty dumb	18
0	i love peterson 's guides but the birds of mexico is severely lacking the art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to north america but unfortunately it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other peterson guides perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of peterson guides but otherwise buy howell 's or edward 's guides both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone howell 's is certainly the most complete but edward 's guide is a bit handier in the field	18
0	a useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing accounting standards and approaches between countries however it is not worth the price it is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students it is more suitable for general second year accounting students plus as i am working with a multinational european bank in japan the book is rapidly becoming out of date there is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries	18
0	unfortunately this book is the sign of what passes for humour these days even though it may have been remotely funny \( sometimes the author comes close to being bearable \) the book never actually tries to be humour is supposed to be smart however this book gives us the worst case of dumb	18

0	as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes deficiencies in the book and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about for instance the claim on page 86 that \( cdata \) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong his description of schema element declarations \( pp 114 115 \) teaches that using globals refs is the only way to define complex elements and is inappropriate for his example he makes no mention of globals at all leaving the reader confused i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information	18

0	this book has too many errors there is nothing more frustrating than to follow the steps outlined and find out it does not work because they did not q a the examples ie they ask you to select a field from the table but the field does not exist the stored procedure does not include it you would have to know how to write sql to correct this	18
0	this was the first collin wilson book i read he has probably read a lot to write this book but to anyone at least a little into the occult it is clear that he have no idea what he is talking about if you are interested in this matter \( the occult knowledge \) as something you would read about but never ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything maybe this book is ok but if you are serious about it and really want to know what true and what is fake please stay away from this book he is so wrong about even simple things that could have been verified with just a few months of practical experimentation	18
0	the only good thing about this book is that it was short even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country gary hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again ok the monroe doctrine is important i get it ! i read about 2 or 3 presidential biographies per month and i cannot remember a book as bad as this if you want a quick view of james monroe you can read the first chapter and skip the rest but this book is not good for more than that	18
0	this is for beginners it 's filled with useless forms and it provides very little information beyond a common sense and reasoned approach to real estate surely there must be better resources than this	18
0	i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women men are to rule and women are to submit to that rule the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read discovering biblical equality it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women	18
0	this book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle read the fat fallacy instead it provides much more practical information	18
0	another hyprocritical nut these christian fundamentalists like are literally screaming jesus while cutting your throats not unlike the jihadi fundamentalists the only thing is they cant do that now as they used to couple of hundred years back by enslaving and lynching blacks killing native americans and showing their christian love for the jews by exterminating them hope our future generations dont have to live in a christian saudi arabia this is what these whackos envision	18

0	the humor is definitely not in the book reviews and summaries use the word hilarity however i did not come across any situation that i would classify as even funny not to mention hilarious i thoroughly enjoyed her first novel pink slip however this one seemed depressing the two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story the plot seemed to be very slow the whole story took place in a matter of days but really nothing took place in the book all in all they bought a house i would pass on this for better reads elsewhere	18
0	i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations in chapter 5 he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly he says the value of c \( t \) must be infinite or nonzero but doesnt bother to show why this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions its not all bad but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it i have read good textbooks this isnt one of them	18
0	tedious and inane come to mind it is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a catty pseudo feminist style rambling descriptions of egyptian archaeology real or imagined thinly veiled racist comments about the ignorant natives of egypt and inept sexual innuendo the book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced the characters do not come across as real very disappointing leave this one on the library shelf	18
0	this book is for the diehard dave navarro fans only the only reason i gave it 2 stars was that the use of instamatic photos in the book is creative the text is nothing more than diary entries by the guitarist neil straus approached writing the dirt with motley crue is a much more creative way which kept me interested this book falls short unless i would have been inclined to want to see things dave 's way i grew restless of this pretty quickly	18
0	for those of you who have not yet read this book this book is about a white wannabe black girl who pays way too much attention to her friend 's puberty i have never read a worse book in my life this book is shallow boring and completely pointless	18

0	this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments although they were right about the obscurity this book still taught me alot you do n't necessarily need it but if you want to be prepared this book will not hurt your bank account that much i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature \( 5 stars check out the reviews \) and the internet that is all you need	18

0	a friend bought this book for my birthday thank god i did n't pay for it i'm sure she meant well as did many other friends who gave me a few guides for las vegas as i visited there for a holiday last month all i can say is that out of all the travel books i had with me this one was by far the most useless outdated listings \( by a few years i would discover when i asked a few locals \) shallow writing and really off suggestions from this writer made this book a real stinker	18
0	i certainly agree that portis is a talented writer but i just did n't find him all that funny perhaps i'm missing something but i thought that the characters were strange enough not amusing just strange i was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited i forced myself to finish the book and i was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book which comes at the very end of the novel	18
0	this book serves the purpose of listing all available moves for the preset roster and shows all available storylines in the game that 's about it no instruction on create a wrestler or for that matter create anything in fact the previous two items i listed \( moves and storylines \) are pretty much the only content in this book i do n't know maybe i'm spoiled by prima and the good job they do writing for pc games they just could have included a lot more content that 's all you could have found any old faq in 30 seconds of search engine poking	18
0	a 600 pages tour of flash mx buttons and menus with just a couple ridiculously elementary tutorials thrown in makes me think of somone who had to write a flash book and has never done anything with it but figure out how the user interface works you wo n't find anything useful in here that is about creating something with flash as for me i am never gonna buy a book from this author again and i am probably also ditching the whole savvy line as well	18
0	this book does n't make any sense it is so so so b o r i n g the book is not well written and the sentences are way too short i woud n't recommand this book to anyone	18
0	erickson a notorious communist and bogus half baked historian is not to be trusted with his works all based on bogus doctored and unrelaible soviet semi fictions intended to advance the cause of bolshevik invincability	18
0	i can attest to the author 's views because i too have precognition telepathy and remote viewing ability for example right now i see the author counting his income from the book and laughing at the gullibility of new age readers	18
0	it 's surprising to see how much the front and back cover promise only to find out how little information and substance it actually delivers the book is very basic providing mostly very general information the chapter on shift levers is particularly incomplete with outdated examples and few details on maintenance and repairs the book may suffer from trying to cover both road and mountain bikes and doing a poor job with both certainly wo n't purchase another book recommended or endorsed by bicycling magazine	18
0	i seem to be in the minority but i did not enjoy this book at all the main character is of course the only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness i felt the plot got swallowed up by the author 's need to self insert and 'play' in her world and the only reason i finished this book was that i was on a plane and had nothing else to do the plot fishtails several times and is n't all that interesting to start with in short i was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general and will likely skip her books in the future	18
0	this series is a travesty i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series but let laura not macbride have the last word on her family 's experience so much in his books rings false the clumsy historical allusions the narrative voice the potty humor one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder 's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she the main character grows big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women macbride does n't manage this and talks down to readers there is a tiny thread of laura in these books but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans sampling is for rap not fiction	18
0	i read this book for a book report and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it because i was forced to read this book i now have the knoledge and misfortune of this pathetically boring story the steriotypical characters hurried through the story full of excuses 1 star for one very boring book	18
0	i have several dummies books from how to build a pc to ccna i had to read this rediculous book when i worked for a very well known dsl provider on the east coast this book was trivial assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly yes i agree hot bot is a pretty good search engine but it is not the only one out there this book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement easily the worst dummies book in print and im not being a jerk i love dummies books ron gilster rocks but this is absolute crap you can honestly get more informed with a magazine	18
0	i have read almost all of the works in the past masters series this is by far the worse i do not ordinarily write about books i do not like but this work truly deserves a bad word it is not about shakespeare but rather about germaine greer she simply did not do the assignment that she was given	18
0	the title says it all one can do better w appleyard 's book	18
0	blind items has the same writing style as at least one of rettenmund 's other books \( boy culture \) he goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the sunday magazine section of your newspaper if you like this writing style rettenmund 's books may be for you personally it drove me crazy and i set the book down after the first few chapters	18
0	my paperback copy fell to pieces after ten days ! it is full of nice photographs but when the individual pages are lying in a chaotic heap on the floor it hardly matters how pretty the pictures are or how intelligent the text is does it	18
0	some of the stuff in here was really screwy it 's not a handbook to the quot food and mood quot book by elizabeth somer which is what i thought it was when i bought it it 's a separate program entirely this one is too woozy and non western for me very little hard data to back up what they say just kind of fruity and flowery	18
0	a little outdated quite a few beers here are n't made anymore beer reviews are always personal opinion and you 'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy does n't know what hes talking about i 'd ignore what they say everybody has their own preference think about this before you buy this book 1 \) why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers \? 2 \) its very out dated 5 years is a long time	18
0	while the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive what i think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics an example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter but does n't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together he just tells you that you need to tie them together what if you do n't have a shoelace to use \? what other alternates are there \? this book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire but it 's not enough for the serious camper	18
0	i saw the tv show made so i wanted to check out the full story it was a disappointment but my wife loved it so there you are one against one for it	18
0	i have yet to read this book however so far the average rating is quite suspicious each one of the three reviewers does not have a single other review in their profile i am at the stage where i am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads' trading so i would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book to do everyone of the rest of us a favor and post an honest review please we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w the author or his publisher	18
0	unlike most of the other reviewers here neither i nor my nine year old enjoyed this book the premise is good but the family values morality is heavy handed and the writing limps along	18
0	seven times the sun is not for everyone it could be a springboard offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life but the songs poems and traditions offered in shea darian 's book are hokey and contrived at best cumbersome and artificial at worst none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book darian is a minister and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent true parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have but i'm just thankful amazon has a customer friendly return policy	18
0	this would have to be the worst book i have ever read wow will is running from dead people some one is trying to kill him so cool how much more boring can you get i would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater so what i'm saying is it stinks	18
0	there was nothing in this book that our association has n't covered nearly every week i was very dissapointed it offered little tidbits like quot a postgame review can help you learn from experience quot do n't we all do quot postgame reviews quot even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home \? i certainly do no i'm not he best umpire in our association i would rate myself as somewhere in the middle the book offered me nothing new nothing that our association does n't talk about constantly buy a childress or save your money	18

0	some photographers think what 's erotic is what 's hidden and left to the imagination two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing leaving plenty to the imagination think of playboy magazine in the 1950 's or vogue or madamoselle magazine today many of these are stylistic but not very erotic one in three of the photos in the book are erotic not afraid of nudity do n't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism instead get shaven angels natural beauties 100 naked girls or crazy sexy girls	18
0	for all of you looking for that favorite book the silly book join my club \( not literally \) the book that has the ode to boodleheimer was written by stoo hample not babette cole i have been searching for this book for years good luck everyone and let me know if you find an extra copy for sale	18
0	i ordered this for a friend thinking it was the same bruce fisher book i bought when i divorced it is only the workbook and really needs a workshop \( or maybe just a book \) to go with it it was a total waste of money and not what i expected when i ordered make sure you are ordering the book not the workbook when you order	18
0	i had high expectations for this book but i was disappointed it concentrated too much on digital systems rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment i lost interested in the last 1 3 of the book and could n't wait to finish	18
0	what happened to this book \? it is a disgrace to the star wars universe it 's practically a star wars dictionary that 's all in spite of the good pictures this book was very disappointing ! ! !	18
0	i am absolutely furious about this book i quit reading about half way through i read it through the section about it 's a wonderful life \( chapter 13 \) in that chapter i found three mistakes not minor details but major provable points including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene within four paragraphs if eliot 's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs how can i trust the rest of the information in the book \? avoid this at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	18
0	the book contained more profanity than i expected to read in a book by rita rudner i had expected more humor from a comedienne too bad because i really like her humor	18
0	if excelsior college did n't require this for the cpne i would take it and throw it off the highest bridge i could find horribly confusing does n't make sense and i cannot fathom how this would help your clinical practice the only redeeming feature is that excelsior does not let you write in this so i will have a brand new copy of this for sale to some poor nursing student i do n't mean to sound harsh but this book is n't easy to use it is confusing and contradicts itself	18
0	this is a very popular book which is sad because it 's highly biased she provides evidence but only uses the 10th that corroborates her story christian study maybe christian fact very loosely	18
0	i agree with the above comments all one sees is a black cover the book looks sounds interesting but there is no table of contents or example of what is inside the book this book needs to present more information if you expect one to buy	18
0	well after i received the book i have to say i was quite disappointed because i am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books after i read the reviews i thought i was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables it turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures if you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed dont buy it the other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented	18
0	this book is a place to start at best the main part of middle eastern cook that i find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices this book calls for dried spices at times the dishes do n't produce the food that i remember eating growing up with my family the book is not a total loss however the spinach pies are acceptable there are many other books out there that i would recommend first	18

1	as a casual piano player and a broadway fanatic i was so jazzed to play some of the songs from avenue q the book contains everything you find on the cd and includes a few production photos of course the little details are fun using terms like manilowesque huey lewis shuffle prissy sonata and funky a groove to describe some of the songs fun fun fu	18
1	this is one of the best biographies i have ever read you can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work it 's a true labor of love filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes this one is a keeper who knew miss francis was such a wild child \? whether you 're a film scholar or a movie buff lynn kear 's book deserves a special spot in your bookcase	18
1	i read this book many many years ago on a very long flight i could n't put it down the philosophy is simple live frugally save invest money every month and you too can be a millionaire it 's great advice especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house expensive car and everything else right now with no regard to the future although some of the info is dated \( enron being named as a great company to invest \) and some other advice \( putting new soles on old shoes \) is a bit much the general message makes plenty of sense	18
1	zadie smith is one of the most powerful authors i have read in recent times she is so subtle about the race factor that we do n't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so she has also captured the emotions of kiki and zora perfectly \( why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments ! \) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down if you enjoyed the movie crash you will love this one	18
1	zig ziglar has done it again as an author myself of sales books i realize sales is about so much more than just having the 'gift of gab ' and fast talking it 's about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers it 's about not just being a consultant to others but being a consultant to yourself it 's recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is zig 's theories exemplify this	18

1	i loved this book the food was really good and fast \( which is good because i have a very packed schedule \) also great if you 're on a budget the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants the only reason it did n't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy \( i'm from texas i like spicy \) to the point my boyfriend could n't eat it i just modified the recipes and everything was fine	18
1	the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival the author obviously knows his stuff what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published i'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j l bourne a deal he 's good	18

1	great story ! ! excellent in fact my beef is with the narrator and editor as someone who grew up in the baltimore area i thoroughly enjoyed the local references however it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce baltimore icons like boog 's bbq at camden yards for the record it is not pronounced bow g ! it is boo g do better research ! !	18
1	this is an extraordinary biography for while blumenson 's admiration for george patton is evident it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of patton 's personality both positive and negative the book truly goes beyond the popular perception of the general and far beyond the movie in exploring his character and motivations not an overly long book but thorough detailed and very enjoyable to read	18
1	gibbon 's decline and fall is without a doubt one of the most well written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the roman empire from the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the imperial court gibbon showcases the history of rome as it unfolded often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time there are a few minute problems or rather gaps in gibbon 's work but given that he originally published in the late 1700 's we can excuse his lack of complete information overall an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject	18
1	i have probably close to a dozen or more people i know including myself that have read this and had great results removing all sorts of chronic symptoms	18
1	this book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low income communities of color in new york city necessary reading for those who still do not realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further fragment and disenfranchise them	18
1	patriotic terrorist fighting storyline exposes the political games played in washington that many times put our military in dangerous situations this book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the special forces men who are so brave i know the book is fiction but i ca n't help but feel that it is more truth than fiction mitch rapp 's wife anna is getting a little hard to stomach she is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man again hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations i hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it although 95 is absolutely wonderful and inspiring portraying men as real men	18
1	since 1965 i 've taught this truth based upon metaphysical studies now at last there is scientific evidence supporting the fact that emotions create facts	18
1	tom friedman 's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts webs and walls states v markets v individuals and the comprehensive failure of the arab street leadership and muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day are extremely well thought out from reading this compilation of nyt columns i understand where friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best selling book 'the world is flat ' although i sometimes disagree with his opinions his ability to see the big picture is spot on	18
1	i bought this book just recently and was really touched \( and cried \) by the whole experience that gus had went through he has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance \( stephanie \) and without her he could 've been out there on the street again overall it 's a good book to read and i always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another this book is a genuine prove	18

1	tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case which encompasses motherhood mental illness child abuse and matricide dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion that in and of itself is impressive because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other get caught up in emotion and appear unable to really present all sides of the story lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society 's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them but also tragically failed their mother	18
1	very topical easy read hope people in the know read this and give serious thought to the potential for something like this happening gives good reason why border control should be taken more serious by everybody looking forward to reading other books by mr bell	18

1	it is almost like dream comes true when i saw the revised new second edition out at the bookstore the imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor but has graciously added new updated materials in synthesis you may see it as an equivalent to jerry march 's advanced organic chemistry but a whole different approach the sections on oxidations reductions and organoboranes are excellent since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like nicholaou 's classics in total synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry	18

1	this is an excellent book its academic sociological approach may put off some lay readers but that would be too bad the subject and the message are both very important in many ways this book is similar to quot the appearance of impropriety how the ethics wars have undermined american government business and society quot but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social science standpoint an excellent book well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed \( at best \) results	18

0	i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player does n't work it 's essentially useless this is a complete rip off at any price point	19
0	i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups and the last 5 or so failed i thought it was my software so i got new software guess what \? my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed too it 's not my burner \( as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read \) as it 's brand new and does n't require the firmware upgrade they mention they just suck and have a high failure rate so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best i'm buying some now and save myself the frustration	19
0	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products	19
0	the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality the only problem is that for every 3 good burns i get one bad one i'm using the plextor dvd burner \( love it ! ! \) but i'm going to try my luck with a different dvd brand the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable it 's less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters	19
0	please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date i 've been denied twice the second time they said the u p c number was invalid only it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state all required products were not submitted meanwhile i have phoned amaz0n to lodge a formal complaint the product itself is average i 've used better and worse that said it 's definitely not worth the full asking price	19

0	you can get a 4 pack of emerging power 2100 mah batteries for 9 95 on this very site i did they work great why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries ridiculous	19
0	i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks if you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page i would n't even use this for a notebook	19
0	we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it did n't have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from if it 's okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up	19
0	bought new around 80 cd player and lcd clock stopped working within 6 months now nap function and radio are all that works if only i could find the damn receipt ! ! !	19

0	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk \? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader	19
0	the card worked fine for my son 's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother 's wedding and i lost all the photos from that event i still ca n't believe it happened if you have an ipod or other remember to back up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this	19

0	this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s6 camera \( but the fuji and sandisk product did	19
0	i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better \( the cd 's were not skipping as much \) but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6 disk cd changer	19
0	some of the worst dvds that i have purchased i would n't waste my money on any more of these pos discs i wish i could return them to amazon but for what i paid \( it was pretty cheap \) its not worth the effort	19

0	i purchased my tv in dec 2004 i did not purchase the extended warranty these sets are have all kinds of video problems myself and other lcd owners have called for in home service the service company is qualxserv in home service they want 350 00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty and can not guarantee a fix take it from me buy some other bran	19
0	the lcd is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency you may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas even then if you are in an are with good fm radio coverage it 's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work mostly you ca n't use this with a cover on and you 'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long the all in one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution	19
0	the extendable arm breaks very easily i had two of them and they both broke within the first month the company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement very poor product do not buy	19

0	i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers i 've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast i'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa 's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa 's lasted only a week be warned that these are n't quite the bargain they may initially seem	19
0	the worst customer service i have ever experienced the lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said you got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect \? viking cheats so what \?	19
0	this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help it is very tempremental and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement so a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so	19
0	beware of this product it always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer i have another usb 1 0 card reader that works perfectly i upgrade to get the speed boost with usb 2 0 but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy	19
0	this remote is so hard to use and setup the xpress functions do n't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers get something else	19
0	i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19
0	i did the research on this product and it was one of the best i do n't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included one if not the only reason i had purchased it i e mailed tiger com and received no reply if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way	19
0	i'm so dissappointed in caselogic for discontinuing the hard cases they were great a hard cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside \( that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center \) somebody could have sat on it and it would 've been fine	19
0	i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you ca n't save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again just push it back up and hopefully if you did it right you 'll have the game right back in the place you left it hey it saved me 50 dollars and it can do the same thing for yo	19
0	i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head is n't working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !	19
0	this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment	19
0	first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphonesalways pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel ! ! ! ! !	19

0	heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer \( imac w intel chip hardly outdated \) simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs \( exactly the same as far as i can tell \) from which i burned one hundred discs \( not a single faulty one ! \) for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas \?	19
0	the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail in rebate even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode \? in my experience with sandisk i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted so you get mail in rebate 50 of the time with sandisk i think mail in rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies do n't trust it !	19

0	this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i would n't take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate	19
0	i do not like this item because it says it is a 16x dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner so if you are looking for 16x do not buy this one	19
0	it 's been over 19 days since my sandisk 512mb transflash card was shipped from emartbuy and i still have not received my order when i contacted emartcrap all they could tell me was that it had been shipped i am sure that flash card works great i just hope that i will receive it before it becomes obsolete avoid emartbuy at all cost do n't settle for incompetency your are better off paying a higher price for better service correction any service	19
0	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for	19

0	how do i assign a rating \? as several other people have experienced my unit is also doa i received it plugged it in pressed 'clean' and the motor started up i popped open the cover put in the disc i wanted cleaned and pressed 'clean' again nothing terrible quality control what 's worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty	19
0	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for 7 10 bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my 25	19
0	i purchased this flash card in june for my gps memory loaded fine but only lasted 3 months card lost all it 's memory and was unable to take a new load very disappointed in the life of the card	19
0	as with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter i bought a vector brand inverter at wal mart and it is much better	19
0	this item worked for a while but required fiddling \( unplugging and replugging repeatedly \) with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets do n't waste your money on this piece of crap	19
0	the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded	19
0	about a year ago i got one of these to allow me to play dvds for my kids on my laptop while travelling it has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately i figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs i had n't tried to use it since now that i'm taking another trip i thought i 'd try it out in other cars no luck the thing is dead does n't do a thing when i plug it in	19
0	each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data do n't waste your money on this one	19
0	i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i could n't listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn	19
0	no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over 6 00 amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !	19
0	these xtreme cd cases stinks literally ! i do n't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smell is absolutely nauseous i kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away nope finally i threw it away other than the smell quality wise it is ok	19
0	in theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive however i purchased three of these \( 2 for me 1 for a friend \) i ca n't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness \( \) all in all a disappointment	19
0	i 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row i 've spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks	19
0	this is n't a consistent product 99 of the time i ca n't get it to work after months of emails and phone calls customer service responded what a joke ! they told me the plug in the unit and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in gimme a break ! i should n't have to do the hokie pokie just to get it to work by the way their process did n't work poor product poor customer service poor price	19
0	i bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when it 's on my lap sitting in a chair i'm very satisfied with it 's being able to accomplish that however the cord ended up breaking after a few months targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle now one of the two fans has started making a racket when i first turn it on after a bit it settles down but very noisy at first	19
0	the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years it lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card it worked just fine for 3 4 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable cheap yes but cheap junk	19
0	the dvds are a rip off although i'm counting on the rebate to at least break even \( not counting my time \) the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk \( i 'd recommend verbatim 's dvd r dl product made in singapore \) as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i have n't submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments	19
0	i tried 4 dvds with different dvd writers and still does n't work this stuff is junk in addition the manufacturernever sent the rebate do n't buy anything from velocity	19
0	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk \? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader	19
0	what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service ! i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play i took it to the apple store in mall of america \( minneapolis mn \) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it i go back home \( ok \) and it still does not work apple said for 113 they 'll fix gee thanks ! i 'll be looking at another brand ! apple stinks	19
0	maybe if these were high end rechargable nimh this would be a reasonable price but for alkaline \? this is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell you can find aaa battieries on amazon for a third of this price	19
0	but i wo n't because i paid good money for it as you can see from the other reviews the speed on this thing is pathetic almost to the point of non functional when it comes to many small files i had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder it took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder makes you wonder if sandisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing stay away or if you really want one buy mine please	19
0	i'm the consumer of sandisk usb flash drives i have used couple of sandisk flash drives \( i e 512mb mini 256mb mini \) before i bought this product performance wise this particular product is not doing good it 's taking long time to copy files from my computers even it 's taking long time to delete files from this disk so i returned to amazon and looking for mini products from sandisk i doubt all the micro products which is having capacity more than 512mb now i'm planning to buy 512mb or 1gb sandisk mini usb flash drive better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product	19
0	overall the recorder worked ok a moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded dvds could not be finalized for unexplained reasons however that is irrelevant now a few weeks ago the unit stop working i does not turn on at all what a waist ! it is out of warranty now	19
0	product mp3 players sansa m200 series sansa m240we received your item 11 03 2006customer comments 11 13 2006 07 51 am when will i get my repaired or replaced item you have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status please respond \( by the way apple turns around ipod repairs in 1 day ! \) 11 13 still waiting for an update on the m240 you received on 11 3	19
0	no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlieris that regardless of with system you use these labels can alterthe way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or what after some experimenting i didconfirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie	19
0	i connected all the cables as instructed but it does n't work the light is not on so i return it to amazon	19
0	these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration ! ! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12x card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration ! ! very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity \( 12x \) at 1 4 the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !	19
0	the worst customer service i have ever experienced the lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said you got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect \? viking cheats so what \?	19
0	this item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of casio exilim camera but was never delivered now amazon wants me to review it so here your are	19
0	this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you 'd hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod would n't stress the electronics i 'd give this thing 5 stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good	19
0	one of the most essential buttons on any remote is the channel button and it did not work straight out of the box i returned it beyond that setting it up takes time but is not difficult i am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out	19
0	this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv \( which cannot turn the tv on and off \)	19
0	i have two ni mh chargers and sony batteries wo n't charge in them they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers they force you to buy their own non standard charger that probably wo n't again charge other brand batteries and of course this is not mentioned anywhere no wonder these batteries are the cheapest do n't waste your money or support sony 's attempt to bring non standard products into a standardized market soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough	19
0	once again i'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product these are terribly uncomfortable \( for my ears \) and do n't really provide that great of listening experience the frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and then they become distractingly uncomfortable but of course this is just my experience your mileage may vary as they say personally i found my apple ipod 'phones to be better	19
0	i am disappointed in this product i was suppose to write to you from the weekend my two rear speakers just stop working and also myremote control i have replace the batteries but stilldoes not work i do n't have any other rear speakers to try on the system pleasy me what to do thank youepiphane flaviu	19

0	this media did not work on my brand new asus burner even after updating the firmware	19
0	can capture analog video and produce cd rom 's but i expected the ability to produce dvd	19
0	i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd worst frame rate capture and audio capture of avi 's of the four different devices i have tried completely unusable the software is a trial version instead buy the ads dvdxpress dx2 for a bit more ulead 's software is stable and it 's not a trial version it is also the only analog capture device i have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture pinnacle 's dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy	19
0	i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term risky cells it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i'mnot willing to chance it again	19
0	if these were free i 'd still would not recommend them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings it is the discs i must assume since my burner works fine with other brands anyway \( now \) i think it 's best to invest a bit more and get good media	19
0	i had this card for more than 6 months and it worked super in my canon powershot a510 transfers went well too then all of a sudden for no reason i kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago my sd usb converter could n't find the card either i had really good photos i wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good what a joke	19
0	i purchased this boombox over a year and a half ago what i do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and mp3 playback i agree that it could have been better it would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last you cannot rewind fast forward in the song in mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd sometimes i like to hear a certain portion of a song again but i will have to play the entire song again i no longer have the remote and there are some things that i cannot do anymore	19
0	i ordered the 2 year service plan on may 1st this day \( july 31st \) i still have not recievied it i have contacted them a number of times and still nothing do not buy from this company	19

0	this is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons 1 this hub will not work with any usb powered devices so forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub 2 extremely slow usb 1 1 this device is not usb 2 0 compliant3 it is clunky4 does not comke with a power adapte	19
0	wasted my money for this slow hub be aware that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipod etc to this device think again	19
0	i purchased the dlo action jacket \( neoprene for 20 40gb ipods \) for my wife for use on walks etc around town however the ipod does n't fit in properly the circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod 's does n't the plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and does n't align either so you ca n't press the play button so since the ipod does n't fit in the case overall this product is useless pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case	19
0	i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head is n't working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !	19
0	i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room the sound is so so and it has no battery backup lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing it is also very big taking up 1 2 my nightstand the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live this morning i finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trash i wo n't miss it at all	19
0	we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it did n't have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from if it 's okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up	19
0	i would like to believe that this hub works well but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info \( 5 volt 2 1 amp center positive \) i 've been to two radio shacks and online they do n't carry it i'm upset any advice	19
0	i had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds the sound quality was good but the dependability of this item is questionable	19
0	i have an iriver t10 and there is virtually no software to support the usb plug and play interface that mac owners have always expected pay a little more and buy an ipod it interfaces with pcs and macs equally well	19
0	cases very cheaply made break when opening not worth shipping cost waste of money	19
0	it is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them on the flip side once they have been opened once they do n't reclose very well	19
0	very unreliable i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders i find that they 1 \) do n't last get about 50 re recordings not 1500 2 \) may crap out on any occasion multiple cd rw 's with critical material would not read on multiple computers avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks !	19
0	i have the older larger version of this product however it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really do n't work right the windows side includes an actual print shop style program which works awfully if you do get this make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint	19
0	they totally misrepresent this product it does not work with macs i feel cheated and lied to by memorex shame on you	19
0	after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement of course you want a hard copy that is why you bought it just do it	19
0	n e w will waste your time money and your every last nerve before repairing your product eventually they will but not without an exhausting protracted fight	19
0	i wish they had a rating for zero stars i bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters that 's a 24 success rate i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters memorex has really gone downhill	19
0	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products	19
0	i bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether i really expected a better product and durability from microsoft i 've since bought a logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks and love it	19
0	being a graduate student and living in an apartment i was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments it prints off things quite well and it is fast it does not however print 500 pages per month 50 100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them the item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition	19
0	this card is such a disappointment it is soooo sloooooow i use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq it takes forever to copy anything to and from it	19
0	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera it worked for 2 days after that everytime i on the camera it wanted me to reformat the card wth is that \? now i ca n't use it at all i'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon one mistake i made i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card thought it worked and it would be ok i can no longer return it now needless to say i'm too over confident with lexar 's products buyers beware	19
0	i record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc i 'd been using ridata for some time w next to no coasters but figured i 'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around big mistake they skip pixelate and freeze up i have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies i 've done were it a compatibility issue i could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media i'm going back to using my cheap disks ! the lesson here is if it works dont fix it !	19
0	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for	19
0	i just recently bought this and when i installed it norton caught 2 viruses on the install cd	19
0	out of the past 20 burns i have only had 10 dvd 's burn successfully i use roxio cd creator version 7 which does a great job with my cd 's so i'm pretty sure it 's the dvd media not only am i wasting all my money but my time as well i 've tried to lower the burn speed but it does not matter i 'd try something else	19

0	not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand	19

0	the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine	19

0	there are brands i trust and ones i do n't sony has always been a trusted brand but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer i am hoping i have better luck	19
0	i recently bought my second of these the first had a digital tuner you had to get used to the feel after about a year of use one earphone went out the one i just bought has an analogue tuner and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high powered pop \( and around here country \) stations the tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial i ca n't believe sony is charging 40 00 for this cheap piece of junk	19

0	fyi this does not fit the new generation 5 5 of ipods \( 80 gb \) another thing is that there is n't a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd	19
0	i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work	19

0	i live in san francisco and have generally good radio reception this unit could not receive normal fm stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up and i used the fancy dipole antenna on the boston accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna the hd part of the radio is total junk sometimes the audio skips and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired \( meaning 3 or 4 second drop outs \) all in all there 's nothing good about this radio do n't buy it	19
0	de k0unx i know radios i purchased the recepter radio hd a year ago used it for a weekend and returned it immediately even in the denver market with lots of very strong hd signals this radio had trouble finding them i 'd be listening to a strong station and the radio would lose lock go silent and rebuffer before coming back to life this was one of the few hd radios available when i bought it i have since purchased a sangean hdr 1 and love it read my review under the sangean hdr 1	19

0	the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless on battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost invest in batteries rather than this product	19

0	not very happy with this product the software on the pc side does n't work well at all wo n't list all my files and i ca n't get it to update changes or new folders this bugger has way to big of a foot print the remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies hey i have a xbox with xbmc on it get a clue and copy some of it 's functionality it continues to blow away any of the media players i have purchased	19
0	and i was right i should have passed on this it was a pain to configure and then none of the settings would stick whenever i changed the default password it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset that kind of defeats the point returning this item so i can get something decent the money saved is not worth it	19
0	bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help	19
0	you 'll end up looking for something better sound fidelity is pretty bad	19
0	there 's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks it 's absolute junk i put it into the cassette player in my car and the sounds were completely distorted the voice constantly skips and the casette sometimes clicks the quality of sound in my car is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device i 've tried both sides but still no avail i plan on returning it if shipping does n't cost more than the product itself	19
0	i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness \( lt 100 \) just scheduled an exchange lcd	19
0	after having installed the unit for 43 days the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting this was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit flying ! very dangerous ! ! tomtom would not replace the unit as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks ! buyer beware see the tomtom forum for description and picture and other links to the base issue	19
0	i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen i sent it back and it has been 2 3 months i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit	19
0	i have not been able to get this to work again it was great for the first week then it made my computer crash and now i cannot get it installed again i am not sure i like that	19
0	i bought this mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a 200 dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service \? do n't count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product	19
0	nice product before they decided to save a few pennies i have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' not ! 5 stars if it still had the handle or if you do n't need one	19
0	a virtual nightmare with set up no help from their support staff on phones nor online q a poorest choice i ever have made in a product ! ! i am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books item still sitting where i left it useless	19
0	this product has a known defect for serial numbers r641 and less \( see logitech website \) i just received my amazon order and it was serial number r635 it will be sent back tomorrow hopefully amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base	19
0	these are some of the worst ear buds i have heard since the very first ones came out voices are muted highs are muddy and lows are non existant the only redeeming feature is since they are marketed as surround sound \( yeah right \) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers	19
0	maybe mine was broken but i do n't think so because i could see a red light at all the cable ends i connected the splitter to my sound card a tb montego ddl with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo no signal whatever both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card i even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad still no signal i think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter	19
0	cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear cups but after a few months light use i lost sound through one cup then the other in general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on the batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery i had in there lasted longer than the unit itself very disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected	19
0	i was happy with the noise canceling features not the best but definitely works great for airplane rides really helps cut out that background engine noise my problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by targus \( cheers to them \) the second set broke too in a different place the deisgn of these just is n't very sturdy i'm gentle with my stuff too so either i had bad luck w two defective units or they 're just not made well	19
0	it is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor buying this handheld was a big mistake	19
0	i bought one for my son at christmas and it broke after a month it just suddenly would n't turn on amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days before even getting the original back but the replacement model froze up after just 4 days and this time i am getting a refund to quote an e mail from amazon regarding this product as it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought we are not able to send another replacement so do not order one !	19
0	this would be a nice printer if only i could get it to print ! not to mention when i turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed i 've tried over and over to try to print something i 've checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing if your looking for a portible printer you have other options and i suggest using them	19
0	this product will not fix your disc i tried to fix a damaged cd and it only made the problem worse i ended up throwing away the cd and the skipdoctor this is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work i wish someone would have told me this before i spent money on it	19
0	like other users have experienced this unit is no longer functional after 18 months the wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights poor product netgear	19
0	don't waste your money ! i have directv with hd \( 5 lnb \) and the signal was low signal was less than 60 for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching hd so i bought these to amplify my satellite signal they actually attenuated the signal the signal strength was n't improved on the non hd receivers that i have as well it did n't matter where i put them in relation to the dish and receiver	19
0	the headphones sound great no arguement there however i was removing the plastic tips \( which need to be changed every several months \) and the headphones broke the company has only a one year warranty so i was out of luck again i thought the sound was great but for this price i would expect them to be more durable i was hardly touching them when they broke off also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times	19
0	this item is an all around piece of garbage after about 3 months of light use it is stuck in 45 rpm mode i sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode do n't buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which case this is right your alley the garbage alley i would n't even give this to a bum because i would feel bad about it	19

0	after buying this product i opened the case after few days as i was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices however every time i put it in the camera or other devices it gives error and does n't work i could n't use this memory stick since i bought it and as i opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt i am not sure how i can even return it back either basically not at all happy with the product at this time	19
0	the light makes my computer very sluggish even when my laptop is not running off of the battery browsing the internet especially is painfully slow and i am on a high speed cable connection	19
0	i bought this phone for the great features and because i 've had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i ca n't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them	19
0	it did n't match the acoustic wave player i bought there should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces the page from which i ordered both pieces was unclear and i received the cd player with the wrong cd changer i had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player \( i know i 'll be refunded the price of the first changer \) but by then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished i received the real changer a few days later but lost the speakers i think amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss	19
0	in general i 've been happy with belkin accessories but this cable is the pits it lasted less than a month ! i used it to connect my hd dvr cable box to my receiver no crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent i do n't like to support the monster cable hype but because of their lifetime warranty i bought their cable to replace this one so far no problems	19

0	after receiving this drum which was listed as having a 25 000 yield capacity on 12 11 06 today 1 15 07 my printer is giving me the same error message drum near end there was no indication when i purchased this product that it would be refurbished i certainly have not printed 25 000 copies	19
0	the transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do	19
0	i knew better but i did it anyway thinking that it would be a good compromise \( we have ibm dell and toshiba laptops and a sony really nice monitor \) no modem port \( not a surprise but would have been nice \) the video display is well you can see stuff on the monitor one of the usb ports is n't reliable i could go on but you get the picture do n't bother	19
0	every other negative review here is accurate the video connection is horrible the mouse runs on a delay of 1 2 seconds and is unacceptable try the competing kensington product instead it 's more expensive but it works i switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected	19

0	the principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews i was never able to get the card to do anything i tried removing and reinstalling the drivers i tried getting assistance through the web site i tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call i 've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card	19

0	bought it for my wife the pink just did n't match anything in my wardrobe she uses her player for the gym and treats it somewhat rough this case does n't protect the screen from scratches \( see most other reviews \) but it has n't fallen off while she 's worn it either about 1 2 useful really on the other hand it was cheap right \? right \?	19
0	the only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection it is nice that it has a clip and it fits the mp3 player snugly but would be nice if it has a clear window to protect the screen	19

0	i purchased one \( from a local store not amazon com \) brought it home and printed a photograph that i had previously printed on a kodak easyshare printer \( my mother in law 's \) the resulting photograp was horrible it had a very green tint to it i then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer the green tint remained i checked the troubleshooting section of the manual checked cleaned the print heads and still the problem remained given that the product is still on the market i suspect i had a broken unit i did not like the lcd it is very hard to read i adjusted the contrast but it did not help	19

0	i was very disappointed when i received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables cables that you can pick up at radio shack for much cheaper just ridiculous the airport express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and go to your local radio shack for the mini rca cable and a quick search online for the optical to mini	19

0	klear screen has to be the absolute worst product i 've ever used it has nearly ruined my 2001fp i was stupid and used it on my primary display first instead of using the 50 50 isopropyl alcohol water mix that 's far superior to klear screen products my lcd now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out my 3 year old laptop 's display looks nearly perfect because i only used the 50 50 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now	19
0	this remote controller was quite a dissapointment i am using two other philips magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better this one does not look like the picture \( which looks more like the 425 model \) it does not cover the equipment i have \( while the 425 model does \) it 's learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least the range is shorter then that of the 425s conclusion this would make for a nice ornament \( it does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices	19
0	i bought this product to replace a previous hp all in one printer i had this is by far the worst printer i have ever owned it does not like photo paper it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced do yourself a favor don't buy this product ! ! !	19
0	merchandise returned to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment cancelled order ! !	19
0	the only good thing i can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works but software installation is long and tedious \( and took three times on one laptop to get to work \) installed drivers cause my pc to take 45 seconds longer to boot and sometimes \( about 30 \) stop the shut down sequence \( i have to click end in a dialogue box \) the ink runs out \( even the big black one \) amazingly quickly and replacements are 54 at costco it seems you gotta get only hp cartridges as third party cartridges fail i 'll never buy another hp printer	19

0	the shape conforms perfectly to the designer 's hands but unless you share the same dna i 'd avoid this product i 've used many of these over the years and this is the only one i struggled with constantly shifting it to get it 's high and low points in a place that was tolerable i finally reversed it pointing it towards me and it worked a little better this just needs to be a simple pad instead they 've overdesigned it as a gimmick	19
0	i do n't even use it anymore did n't think it was that great i got a gel rest from fellows a lot better	19
0	i am on my 2nd unit and both lockup after a short time neither the remote nor the front buttons will work when it locks up you have to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes maybe longer it works good when it is working	19

0	what were they thinking \? or are they thinking at all \? sonic stage is a piece of crap it freezes hangs and very very user friendly \? \? \? \? since you need their software to load the music i would stay away from this player as far away as possible pros nice sound quality cons everything else my recommendation is go for creative usb players it 's very good quality and better battary life with creative players you just drag and drop files and you done with it i see why sony is failing in mp3 players market	19

0	easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working horrible customer service ! will never buy from this company again !	19
0	the unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card this requires determining the cf card id when registering instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating magellan 's web site is tricky at best if you enter the cf id incorrectly you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the cf card beware	19
0	i went online to amazaon a site i trusted to locate an hd radio for my desk at work this was listed as an hd radio only after i received it opened it and plugged it in did i discover it is not an hd radio both the 3rd party vendor and amazon claim i have no right to a refund the fcc calls this fraud and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation	19

0	i liked the md671 for the home office so i thought the md7161 would be a good upgrade for the home phone not so the handsets intermittently cut out when the person on the other end is speaking i tried all the troubleshooting recommendations with no change in the problem if you cannot hear the entire conversation that sort of makes the phone unusable right	19
0	this thing is a piece of junk it stops working in between of a song for no reason u can get a better mp3 player if you are spending this much	19
0	rarely do i write a review but this product is so bad i had to expecting sony electronics to perform well what a disappointment this one is a bummer save your money there has got to a better under cabinet radio out there while the concept is good and the design sleek do n't be fooled by the packaging nothing works well fm reception is poor sound is terrible controls are not intuitive to top it all off a year after purchase \( yep the warrantee just expired \) the cd player decided to only play the first track of any cd inserted forget listening to the rest of it this product is really zero stars i 've tossed the whole works in the garbage	19
0	it 's too small and signal is too weak the life of battery is too short not recomment to buy this you can find some other model better quality	19
0	check 10 cases at least 6 are broken in new box i do n't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces	19
0	hard to believe this product is still being sold when it 's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods also the claims of good design i feel are overstated finally the speakers are weak and sound like it wo n't be long until they 're shaking this may influence what music you 'll end up playing through the system all said though i 'd be happy with it for the price if only they 'd update it to fully handle my ipod	19
0	my printing problems began two months after warranty expiration i tried every troubleshoot i could find three times what a beautiful machine it does everything very well it even looks great sitting there on the desk but what if it stops printing then what good is it \? i finally gave up and bought something else	19
0	i ordered this for christmas from a marketplace seller it was defective and assumed i would have to deal directly with philips to get a replacement after seven weeks i still do not have a replacement from them their customer service people keep telling me 10 15 days and i have no recourse i also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if i could or even get the unit i would not recommend buying this or any other philips product to anyone their customer service is the worst i 've ever dealt with i also had to pay the shipping to return their defective dvd player	19

0	you do n't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel \? there 's no gold inside ! so there 's no need for oxygen free gold tipped multi sheilded super mega supreme cables if you do n't believe me buy this cable and a no name cheapie compare them for yourself you will see no difference with analog signals a good quality cable may make a difference \( although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope \)	19
0	man were we diappointed with this ge phone ! we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we could n't figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a 10 year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it 's unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere \? \? \?	19
0	nice basic phone i 've used it happily for two years until the battery died what 's the deal with the batteries on new cordless phones \? my 5 8ghz toshiba wonder died after less than 2 years while my trusty at t from mid 90s keeps on ticking	19
0	this is an excellent item for anyone on the go who has an ipod nano no longer do you need to carry those cumbersome cd 's around or get distracted while driving when a cd ends and you need a new one why pay the big bucks for a cd changer player when all you need is this an ipod nano	19
0	the price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item but after only about 1 000 pictures all i got was corrupted data i had the card professionally tested to ensure it was the card and nothing wrong with my camera it definitely showed the card was the problem luckily i had recently done a download wo n't trust my pictures to this brand again	19
0	this was the worst electronics puchase i 've ever made when i first got the mini it was great looked nice and sounded great within about 6 months battery life started to go way down after a year it was down to nothing did n't work properly would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes if you 're going to take a chance on an ipod definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one	19
0	i had my pink ipod mini since feb 2005 it was fine until it died the next year on the exact day i got it and the warranty ran out i got it repaired at an apple reseller and then it died again on the warranty expiration date what is it with the ipods \? it 's like they have a self destruct inside ! \)	19
0	i 've been looking for this style of phone for a while looks great works great but it 's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use it 's both more narrow width wise and length wise than my samsung sph a900 when the samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone i want a small sleek mobile phone but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home if it we 're 1 3 larger it 'd be excellent maybe a great phone for women also it does not have any plugs for headsets i am returning mine to amazon	19
0	i do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon com but this time as i was listening to my car audio today i was compelled to leave one for others this product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments i bought for mp3 player audio system its sound reproducing transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality it does not balance well the low high frequency sounds resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity mine worked ok for the first several hours i assume i think it damaged the speaker and it now sounds like it 's going to rip apart someone else left review explaing this trouble which i ignored which was a mistake again do n't buy	19
0	my wait has been 17 weeks and i received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another 30 days one big difference ! ! ! ! the item is now listed as available but for more money than i agreed to pay back in november if this is amazon's way of making me take a walk and give circuit city my it worked	19
0	this is a terrible product if you can get it to print the labels look great but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that i can find i get an error that it did n't print but no reason why i 've installed on two different pcs one is brand new and same thing happens software is also pretty useless it also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive the online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond	19
0	i was expecting at least a degree worth of difference it did not help at all ! absolute waste of 50 dollars	19
0	had this set of speakers for close to a year now they really are nothing special for the price one problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift \( if you lock in a signal at all \) ! they do come with power cord to plug each speaker into ac i have outside wiring so this is no trouble two if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out if you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone and mounting them in a high traffic area \( i mounted mine high above head level \) don't purchase them	19
0	these speakers in one word suck i made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap i guess i forgot the old adage you get what you pay for did n't i \? they worked okay when i first installed them in a week i got bad signals and the speakers did n't work properly worse purchase i 've ever made ! ! do n't make the same mistake i did please ! spend the extra money and get quality speakers	19

0	i bought this item because amazon never had the 3m model i wanted in stock so i settled for this one that was a big mistake the wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable the spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the cpu it is really a two person operation finally if your cpu has a side access panel you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer take a look at the 3m cs100 stand i think it is a much better design	19
0	this item will not work with pixma mp810 printers none of the photo pigments are compatpable with this unit i am now the proud owner of a cli 8pc ink tank that is completely useless to me i suppose it 's my fault since when i looked at these reviews several other people had the same problem let all other buyers be aware and not make the same mistake	19
0	do not buy this unit i have tested the vosky iogear and now us robotics and they are all junk while the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate i do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit and why are the so small ! \? the are so small as to be practically useless the iogear unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons bottom line wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a polycom and the computer calling kit that is available through polycom \( even the polycom computer calling kit is analog ! what is the problem ! \?	19
0	very simply put the sound is wonderful the design stinks i too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones that lasted 2 days and they fell off i do n't know what bose is thinking clearly they are not doing any end user testing update bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently do n't fall off pretty cool i gotta upgrade my rating from 2 to	19
0	this item was not practical it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	19
0	this product is great the only problem i have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item i get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer i want to use this item but i am afraid to please verify you certificate so i can complete my downloa	19
0	this is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours \( but did make it beyond the very short warrenty \) it was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long for the price i expected a durable and well built machine i was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it	19
0	if your router is not by d link and particularly if you use wpa encryption with that router do not purchase the dgl 3420 i have tested it with both the linksys wrt54g and the smc 2804wmbp g and wpa fails with both of them d link technical support in fact has confirmed that they know the adapter does n't work using wpa with the wrt54g besides for significantly less money you can get a wireless bridge with a lot more functionality after this product failed for me i purchased the netgear wgps606 which can connect four items \( x box computer whatever \) to your wireless network and two wireless print servers all for 20 less \( on amazon \)	19
0	when this jumpdrive was plugged into my windows 2000 system the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive the lexar technical support was no help at all they told me to reinstall my system luckily the computer repair person i hired was able to recover my data files before the os was reinstalled lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost i will never purchase one of their product again	19
0	when it worked it did as described but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it there are many better more reliable brands such as the sony micro vault which i have now nevertheless i would n't put anything on these that i did n't have backed up these drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer heat will cause them to fail faster	19
0	i bought two lexar thumbdrives over other brands partially based on their rebate offers despite my methodical record keeping and submission i simply got post cards saying that i did not meet the rebate requirements \( in place of the rebate checks \) the first time it happened i thought it was oh well my fault but the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission this is simply frank fraud by lexar on a smaller scale therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further i hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again	19
0	this is the worst pice of electronics i ever bought started falling apart after few days only battery life is a joke software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it wo n't work with os prior to xp you will find that out after you 're done installing it mediocre performance do n't waste your money on this one	19

0	while i'm driving this thing does n't work at all there 's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time the only time this fm transmitter works is when my car is still maybe it 's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter ca n't reach it overall i 'd say this product is garbage	19

0	this player is junk it would not play music for more than two hours before going dead when i called toshiba the person that i talked to claimed he was n't aware battery life was even a problem i directed him to read some of the reviews on c net which i discovered after i bought it \( my fault \) it was finally returned and the battery was replaced now \( after two weeks \) it wo n't even hold a charge i'm returning it and will not recommend this to anyone	19
0	i 've had these speakers for three years now hissing popping not holding signal all that has been true from day 1 and tonight one of the speakers just would not turn on the power supply was n't the problem it 's something inside the speaker box and something that apparently cannot be fixed so my other one will be mono until i can come up with an alternative solution oh well	19
0	we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera 's return policy they grudgingly allowed me to return it as a one time courtesy with a restocking fee i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company	19
0	i have gone through 4 pairs in 4 months because they keep breaking one thing after another either one ear stops or they both stop in the same hour ! ! ! i would n't dare unless you can return them easy	19
0	i bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my ipod i used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound sending these ones back i must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well \( much to my mom 's dismay she could n't fuss at me p \) oh well	19
0	the description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in rugged conditions in reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber i suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling	19
0	has anyone else experienced the following \? used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems then have run into \( so far \) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months after various attempts to narrow down the problem i tracked it down to the blank cd rs i had exactly the same problem occur with another brand which was replaced with these tdks is there some unwritten shelf life for blank cd rs or am i just unlucky \?	19
0	creating a dvd using imovie to idvd even on a powermac g5 quad \( superfast supergreat ! \) is a 4 5 hour process a 10 15 failure rate due to poor media quality is unacceptable ! the 'quality control' at memorex sucks ! it is not so much the cost of the bad dvds but there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5 8 out of every 50 i have used causing a failure to burn after a very lengthy set up process i will be using verbatim blank media from now on !	19

0	this portable tv sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design they do n't tell you that there is no antennea nor that the tv will not work without an antennea ! the portable dvd player is great the tv is horrible when we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken don't buy this for the tv ! we ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in this one was a total waste of money	19
0	the product does not work in my view i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95 of the cases it is not much different than entering the information manually the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective does not even recognize that wireless is the mobile phone number one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years the only good thing is once you scan the cards you can throw them away but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand	19
0	i bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player i tried it for at least 10 times but no luck wet clean the lense manually is the best way but that will include getting the player out from the dash board	19

0	very disappointing ! i was hoping i could at least get one or two viewable network affiliate vhf stations instead the best the antenna could pull in was color enhanced snow and sound laced with static tried all three antenna hook up options in fact my set pulled in the same signal with or without the antenna	19
0	please do n't be fooled by it 's inexpensiveness i am a victim of it i already bought this card and within 2 weeks i started getting read and write errors i formatted the card and it now has 2 mb of bad sectors unlike the other reviewer i did had 2 gb to begin with but i think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap it is not at all reliable now i am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me	19

0	i'm usually a big linksys supporter this is an exception this device is a joke not a very funny one the first thing i was told when i called for support was it most likely would n't work with my printer \( canon mp950 \) i spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support do n't waste your time	19
0	i followed the install instructions to the letter but the install program started giving me an error that i could n't get past i downloaded the latest install from the linksys web site and got past the point where i had been getting the error but i could n't get the print server to connect to my wireless network when i had the print server connected to my network via an ethernet cable it detected the attached printer but could n't even print a test page successfully this product was a complete waste of time	19
0	this was my first and only purchase of a linksys product i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer then hooked it up to another printer only to have it die just out of warranty a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer does n't even stand behind it	19
0	syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser i got my daughter one as a gift gave it to her bran new in the factory sealed box and syntax refuses to honor the warranty \( and yes i calld everywere and tried everything \)	19
0	i just bought these matte labels when i printed a photo i noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels smudge when fingers are lightly run over the labels has anyone experienced this \? please share your story	19
0	i did not receive the correct product that i ordered i informed the seller and he stated that i would need to resell on ebay myself very disappointed with his service kell	19
0	long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual fm reception this is in town trying to receive a major station i am packaging this up and its going back today this is my second try with sony that has miserably failed guess maybe i should be looking at another mfg	19
0	i purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their tv 's to watch programs rather than listen to music reception was horrible ! ! ! while i was in the gym i tried just listening to the radio and could n't even get that to come in clear the only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies ! not impressed at all ! i will be returning this and maybe buy the 12 generic set instead	19
0	i also had the model before the m85v and got great reception this new model gets terrible reception i still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception do n't waste your money on this model !	19
0	reception is only acceptable if you are seated with the headphone antenna adjusted to maximize signal strength	19
0	i hate this unit with a passion and i sell the things its cheap 299 99 at most retail place right now and that 's what you are getting the one died in 24 hours while plugged in and never turned back on it also directed us to a road that was headed into the pacific ocean there is no road across in the pacific last time i checked it acquired satelites once and then never acquired them again and good luck talking to customer service both i talked to did n't speak english a dreadful unit maybe tomtom could go work at walmar	19
0	mouse movement is extremely slow it literally takes 10 \( ! \) seconds to get from one side of the screen to another \( 800x600 \) i just got it from officedepot buttons are too small and hard to control joystick is unresponsive	19
0	it works if there 's a direct line of sight to the reciever in other words if the ipod is lying down horizontally it wo n't respond you 'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work	19
0	should have believed all the other negative reviews did n't work in my honda civic and did n't work in my nissan altima both with original manufacturer tape decks in both cases the tape deck whirred for a bit then ejected the smartdeck	19
0	do not buy this if you own the c340 it does n't fit and amazon should n't market this as if it will it 's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund this is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter i hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise you 'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money the garmin is great but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem	19
0	disaster supposed to work in conjunction with cordless phone extensions but will not work with other desk phones ! it only works with cordless phones i wanted a desktop phone on every desk with the cordless as a convenient extra feature but now every office is stuck using only the very clumsy cordless handset we were not informed of this until after we purchased and installed the phones no mention of the hold 'music' in the manual this product is a mess stay away get a real phone system	19
0	if there were a catagory for 0 stars that 's what i would have rated it i bought this model only because i wanted a tv that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter the radio works the cd works but the tv died after l month and the tv was the only part i was interested in what kind of product is this \? i would like amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit carol gruber	19
0	really wo n't use the tv but the cd only lasted 5 days and i use it everyday had to buy something else	19
0	basic connectivity and wireless work any attempt to use advanced firewall rules fail including vpn passthrough this device could not have gone through even a rudamentory test cycle please read the reviews this is common and these problem were confirmed by my it dept and also by d link 's tech 's as well on second one all of the exact same problems sad to have made a choice hope they make it right	19
0	had to give it one star because there is nothing lower this printer was the answer to my printing dreams for about three months with light home use only fault at that time is it is loud it will wake the dead which is ok since the dead do n't have to print things that often this is the perfect printer for them other than noise a faulty load paper error kept coming up then the paper load went bad it is very unreliable and ink cartridges run out very quickly and cost about 10 bucks a pop tonight i'm trashing it buying another printer tonight ! do not waste your money on this piece of trash	19
0	this printer does produce some fine output that is when it works the paper feed constantly refues to load paper the film scanner should have been left off all together \( not worth using \) i have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit \( read alot of negative reviews \) i have been a long time hp fan but after this experience i am going to look elsewhere my advice is to not even consider this printer	19
0	i just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player earliest date i can find one is 10 23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs i'm at a loss now that the battery is dead this is the dumbest idea ever why did n't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player \? i agree that you should order a back up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important	19
0	i ordered two of these for the first one neither the firewire nor the usb worked on my imac g5 \( macos 10 3 9 \) a copy would start and then hang after a while i returned it and the second one worked using usb but the firewire would hang like the first one a friend has one that works fine with his ibook g4 under 10 3	19
0	the user interface was horrible the product documentation was even worse i still ca n't figure out how to perform a regular scan no ocr this was poorly designed poorly supported get some other scanner this one is impossible	19
0	one month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine my car 's engine sounds better do n't waste your money i called sharp and they say is the fan great maybe i should remove it and use ice cubes	19
0	the problem is i have more than one guitar this one is my least favorite p s has bad soun	19
0	this is a piece of junk holy cow is it cruddy do n't even call it a guitar because its not its a bad thing to call it a guitar holy crud where 's the tylenol !	19
0	these work great initially i bought six of them of the six four broke one stopped altogether one stopped oscillating and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed i bought them in may and they broke after 2 3 and 4 months respectively they are expensive fans and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all i have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty \( this is 1 year \) and higher quality components	19
0	the paper stripes of 1 4 are too wide at times information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear if somebody is really after information he should n't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper	19
0	very poor design would never recommend this product the connection is so flaky you will end up wasting lot of time	19
0	i watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also if properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to tv is this unit record the show while watching the same show on tv \? \( some of the units can not record while you are watching the show tv has to be off ! ! ! ! ! !	19
0	operates as described but lacks browser for use in pay for connection environments poor battery life need to have it fully charged every day even if you did not use it the previous day needs mute function volume could be louder too i would wait and buy next generation	19
0	the product description in january 2007 is inaccurate batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours not 60 there is no hands free speakerphone if you use a standard plug in headset the microphone does not work \( tested two units \) there is more the headset is very loud \( you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear \) but there is no volume adjustment the microphone has low sensitivity so you find yourself yelling into it the clock resets itself when the power is turned off i returned mine	19
0	this product has the potential to be tremendous but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches also there is a big 'rhigo skin' logo on the front which makes the case even that more distracting i'm sure that it is n't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail what a letdown p s if you are buying the 30gb version of this case it will double the thickness of your setup	19
0	this very expensive cable is already in the package if you purchased the forerunner 201 you wo n't need this unless you somehow lost it damn it is expensive ! this is a cable for goodness sake	19
0	i bought this printer based on its good reviews it does print beautiful photos but i have n't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only the problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly after several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual i contacted canon they ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body	19
0	any pictures that i have printed with the color cartridge have come out too dard	19
0	i ca n't say the reason but this card blocks all the time after some days without use for unblock it i have to take it out many times and clean contacts then without knowing exactly what worked it begins to function	19
0	i bought one of these and it broke the first day i used it amazon replaced it for free but for no good because the second one broke soon after i got it too very poor laminator i went to office depot and bought one from xerox and it works much better	19
0	the phone was very annoying everytime i tried to call on the phone it would not connect i would have to either change the channel or just not call i was only able to connect to the number i was calling once in the 30 times i attempted to call i returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone consumers report was very wrong in their rating of this phone the phone was terrible !	19
0	i purchased this item to record lps into my computer thru the input on this device it sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop had same experience with loud right out of the box too startled me out of my skin ! mine did n't come with any disk although the box mentions software then again i bought this from an amazon 'partner' from amazon spend your money wisely and get an imic i'm going to	19
0	i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work	19
0	the product seems like a great idea however it did not come with attatchments for an i pod which is the reason we bought it called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number it has just been a hassle	19
0	j r packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival	19
0	there is something quite wrong with the laser mouse 6000 the shape is not right it 's kind of shallow i have to be conscious every time i grab this mouse so that i do n't to hit the side buttons all in all terrible	19
0	there are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player well it comes with no software or anything else if all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget i	19
0	i would never buy this tv again or a samsung product for that matter i obviously purchased a lemon have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck samsung initially told me i would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when i called back i was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period how 's that for sound logic i really like it when it works but unfortunately an important aspect of a tv is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button	19
0	as the title it not worth the money at all even at such a low price the picture quality is bad very bad i 'd rather spend this money for other web cam	19
0	i bought a pv d4744 about a year ago it worked for a while now it wo n't read old disks and even with brand new disks the chance ofit being able to read the disk are not good about 90 of the brand new disks i have triedit wo n't read i will never buy another panasonic product again	19
0	i got this and installed it it ca n't read cds or dvds it ca n't write cds it can only write dvds	19
0	why would anyone get this type of charger \? for about 40 you can get an isupercharger that you can plug into the wall plug into a car lighter plug into a usb port or run off of a 9 volt battery with the 9 volt battery option you can use your ipod all you want even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping it 's a small all in one design i do n't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when i take my ipod along	19
0	i used it once and it charged my ipod only 80 after about four hours the next day i tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely this thing is garbage !	19
0	egad ! upon receiving this remote control i found that it requires four aaa batteries there was no mention of that requirement in the product description ! i concur with the other review writer the control is top heavy and i would add poorly designed it 's thick at the top and thin at the bottom making it unwieldy i will be returning this monstrosity	19
0	although these labels were functional i was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels i had purchased previously and these tended to tear easily	19
0	i sent it back the price was right but the caller id did n't function when i got in touch with at t they told me maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home \( stupid response ! \) i then asked why would at t put a phone on the market that 's not compatible with my other phones i did n't get a reply ! ! ! they wanted to send me a replacement i told them there is no point in doing that if the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones ! i guess amazon will be sending it back to at t	19
0	the cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic the cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use so i called coby they said i 'd have to pay them to send me a replacement ! my advice do n't bother buying coby	19
0	i bought this for my 12 year old who so far has n't been able to get it to play \( i have n't either \) before giving up on it we have to retrievethe directions from his grandmother 's house and read them thoroughly i'mdisapointed since coby 's have a good reputation	19

0	the card was defective have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works hopefully wo n't have to keep doing this too many times have already wasted a lot of time on this pretty frustrating	19
0	i purchased one of these radios before christmas and it works great i decided i wanted another for work so i ordered another one i recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the preset weather stations are off the mark and the only thing i can pick up is distorted and garbled they sent me a replacement and it too is off station at this point i'm wondering if the first one i got was the exception i do not reccomend this product unless you just want an am fm radio that part works great this will be my last first alert purchase unless i can try it out first !	19
0	do n't buy if you plan on printing often runs out very very fast	19
0	i do not do much printing but the ink ran low after a very short time it did not last as long as it normally does when i purchase it at an office supply store i wondered if it had dried out	19
0	i loved this printer ! ! the print quality is truly phenomenal ! i had a few issues with paper sizes too many pieces being fed through the rear feed slot same as other reviewers but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful and yes i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months ! exactly one month after the 1 yr warranty my printer is unfixable and hp wo n't do anything for me after speaking to 8 people on the phone \( only one of which i understood fully \) and 3 supervisors they just said that i'm sol so yes very nice printer if it lasts	19
0	i ordered the unit twice and twice i received a carrying case not the adapter i returned both and ordered direct from cobra when i had called customer support for amazon the second time i got connected to india of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong i guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says	19
0	i burn about 50 cds a week in live music trades i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last after a year or so they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems any scratches that they have only make it worse i recommend using sony fuji or tdk all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just do n't stand the test of time so if you care about preserving your cds do n't use these ones	19
0	this is not an xd to compactflash card adapter if you order this item number you will receive a pc card adapter that accepts xd picture cards and smartmedia cards and fits your pcmia 2 1 slot on a pc or mac it is not for a camera or substitute for a compactflash card there is nothing compact flash about it the product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon 's website	19

0	soon parted very disapointed bad design not for the gym which is what i bought them for sound is ok not wonderful wish i would have read these reviews before i spent the 100	19
0	i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are ! i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr i then saw the pricetag and unlike the other people i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr ! it is definitely not worth it for something i get for 8 extra a month attached to my cable service yes i do love the tivo interface and searching but i will not pay that much for it it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price knock 700 dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind	19
0	i was very disappointed when i got to south america and went to curl my hair and nothing happened take a look at the product specifications it has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts i had two different curling irons with me one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts i am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for take my recommendation buy the converter by tumi instead it is twice the price but it is one piece easy to travel and works with many different types of appliances i am very satisfied with it	19
0	this cartrige never printed any color than red even after cleaning many many times ! will never buy another cartrige from them paying twice the price for one that works is a better investment	19
0	the radio for the boom box worked the cd player did not work i had to return it to be repaired or replaced i do not have it back yet	19
0	manual and i cannot find that it supports sacd	19
0	the sony mdr if3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear perhaps if one were an elf or a small child they would fit properly however if you 're like me a mere adult mortal they probably wo n't fit you they would be okay for simple stereo listening but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description if you 're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie the sony mdr if8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money	19
0	this is a piece of junk the radio reception is terrible fm is marginal and am is almost nonexistent	19
0	the unit was 20ft from the receiver in the same room in direct view of eachother tivo would n't connect	19
0	i have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to windows vista as a result of the windows upgrade this product just lost half its value for me the drive works fine physically but the included backup software will not work with vista when i try to schedule an overnight backup the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling as others have noticed here western digital offers zero support for its software i cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem	19

0	horrible the first time i slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front defeats the purpose for even buying it i would recommend getting an agent 18 case	19
0	this unit will not fit all lighter sockets i 've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife 's saab 9 3 the 33185 version does fit	19
0	everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it does n't come with the usb cord to hook the printer to the computer and that is a little important also i have windows vista and the printer is not compatible with it i have to download a patch but that was my own fault i guess you get what you pay for	19
0	first few weeks it worked and now we really needed it when driving in remotes areas 3 hrs away from home through a snowstorm it gave up working and we never were able to turn it on again we didnot take a map as we were sure with this navigation system we would be safe however we felt pretty unsafe and lostvery frustrating and we are very disappointed with this recently expensive magellan navigation system and with amazon as a usually depending sourc	19
0	not at all what i wanted it is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you do n't want them pushed ordered 2 and plan to return them i usually do n't even bother to write a bad review i just do n't write one but in this case i 'll make an exception yuk ! actually i rate it at a 0 but there was no 0 selection	19
0	this is a cheap cable in both cost and quality when connected between my voodoo3 3000 card and my mag innovision dx17f monitor the picture quality was poor with severe quot ghosting quot of the screen this cable does not have the cylinders on each end as most monitor cables do i assume the lack of these cylinders is what causes the degradation in signal quality	19
0	we 've been through 2 generations of this phone and they suck why we gave them a second chance i do n't know the buttons that get used the most stop functioning after about a couple of years then it 's off to the landfill i am fed up with this trend in products to stop working after a limited amount of time so long motorola	19
0	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested the etch tore when examing the inside of the printer i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage the next new cartridge would not work either wasted tech support said to have the printer repaired ya sure \( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out \) printer repair would cost me more a new one	19
0	beware this unit does not work with toshiba laptops tech support is non existent you will never get through on the phone email support is non existent you will have to wait weeks to hear back if it does work with your laptop this unit does a great job of recording and playing	19
0	these speakers are big in size but short on performance except for the price tag not much else excites one about them they make a good surround sound system with the sony 3 speaker set for surround sound but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub these speakers lack bass inspite of their size and sound quality is poor at higher volumes	19
0	i found this paper on amazon as an accessory to the olympus camedia p 400 printer this paper does not fit the p 400 because this paper is too wide thus with the p 400 this paper is useless	19

0	i spent two days tried to have it formatted by my powerbook g4 and set up a wireless network to replace my microsoft wireless router no luck it is on the shelf ever since people at the genius bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel to set up other routers with a pc you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars not apple if you do n't have time do n't buy this product	19
0	i got this for christmas 2004 played 5 dvd 's on it and started to get the quot no disk quot reading i only had it for 1 month i sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model we will see if it has the same problems according to reviews of the 1700m model i expect the same i suggest you spend a little more money and get a better dvd player	19
0	the item is good the sound is decent but i tought than a refurbished item was an item that you can hardly say it 's used the speakers i got did not look good at all scrached and dirty you can see it was used for a very long time no too happy about this item	19
0	when it works it does extend the range however every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again the pc is not assigned an ip number unplug this extender and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly connected pcs i purchased this particular d link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di 624 router i wasted my money buying this device it 's useless and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop	19
0	this device is much bulkier than it needs to be but an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod the ipod plugs in to the back and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too	19
0	other than the power switch is not easy to see the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you even using it for church meeting recording you would not get excited for its sound quality if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm ms907 you may like the sound quality of that microphone if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice try the akg wms 40 wireless system our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one	19
0	why not sell the thing with a battery it 's a special battery not available in the boonies so i have a choice drive 30 miles or wait another week for a battery to come in the mail iknow iknow in the text it does say battery not included but who reads that \? so for the folks who read this buy a battery too ! ! !	19

0	i 've had this scanner for 6 months now it worked ok the first month but since then it loves to eat paper it scans multiple pages at once for example a 20 page document becomes 15 pages one scanned i have to scan the same document multiple times \( sometimes up to 12 times \) until the scanner finaly scans each page it gets to be very frustrating actually it 's the worse piece of office equipment i ever purchased otherwise it works fine	19
0	this linksys stuff simply does n't work and do n't try getting technical support it 's a complete waste of time if you ca n't google the solution just take the stuff back the adapter install took out my tcpip stack even for my wired connection it took me 3 full days to figure out that i needed to remove any sign of linksys odyssey and funk software from the registry then remove and reinstall the tcpip stack linksys support could n't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days a dozen emails and 5 separate phone calls linksys support is just embarrassing do n't be caught having to depend on it	19
0	my title is my review the thing worked for a week after that it would n't power up anymore chinese junk	19
0	i purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy i could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke i threw it away it is a piece of junk	19
0	i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work	19
0	i had the tx sr304 everything sounded great however certain times when i played my dvd the onyko produced a loud high pitched ear piercing sound sounds almost like a record scratching the most common times it made this sound was during the dvd menu when it replays the music theme the receiver would transition from dolby digital to stereo then back to dd again then making that loud sound everything was great but this one problem made me return this item which is a bummer because i would have kept it otherwise	19
0	i bought this hub less than 2 months ago it has stopped working ! if i plug it in it is no longer powered do not buy this p o s !	19
0	this phone stopped working just right after i threw all the packing material away horrible horrible static non user friendly buttons as well i wish i could have returned it do not buy this phone	19
0	the sound quality is fine if you are in range the dual headsets work as advertised in other words 1 you cannot talk on both phones at the same time \( instead you can transfer a call to the other phone \) 2 the range is not great \( though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft \) 3 the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none other than that it 's a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household	19
0	make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying apparently they work fine with sony camcorders \( the packet too says so \) but not with canon also it 's incompatible with my new panasonic camcorder too interestingly it was displayed as a combo offer when i bought my panasonic camcorder which is the reason why i bought it anyway but got duped	19
0	these discs do not work with my canon camcorder i think the label should inform people they may not be compatible with certain devices	19
0	tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality	19
0	switch did not work with my samsung 191t monitor customer service people were slow to respond and were not helpful	19
0	the apple remote is included with the imac g5 and works great with it and front row however for the ipod it 's almost useless the lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling in short do n't buy this remote look at other non apple remotes that are more full featured	19
0	this antenna is too directional dependent almost always i have to re adjust its orientation to obtain better reception on any one channel in addition if you live in an apartment very close to or surrounded by adjacent apartment blocks forget about this antenna given most of the previous reviews it will probably work okay if you live in small buildings	19
0	i 've had my micro for over a year now and when it worked i loved it ! however i'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue the sound is output in layers and i am constantly trying to reposition my headphones to get full sound my husband called creative labs for assistance and he was told that it would cost him per month for a customer service subscription after reading these reviews it seems we 'd be paying creative labs so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can \( or will \) do next brand please	19
0	7 out of the 25 disks would not write i didnt much care for the product considering this factor	19
0	i cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about 20 of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo 270 this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda	19

0	purchased cobra 75 wx st all in handset mobile cb about 1 year ago easy installation up front controls very convenient six months after installation speaker in mike failed could only get sound through external speaker using external jack repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost	19
0	i use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the gps 360 device further down the dashboard this adapter apparently ca n't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle i 've only used it twice first time it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half the connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable but i'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again i do n't want the connector to snap off next	19
0	this cable looks nice when you do n't linger on a digital channel what happens to me is that if i leave the tv on a digital channel overnight the next day it will be a split screen mode showing double image of the broadcast to fix it i have to change it to a non digital channel and switch it back i guess it is possible that it is the cable box but nothing happens like that on the component outputs	19
0	returned it would n't work with vista and a canon mp780 and it certainly wo n't work with mac os x clients \( note the product does n't advertise support for mac \) why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers	19
0	true to its name it has high sensitivity too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live start moving in all directions on my couch the mouse is dead if the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive but when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck the paws foot of the mouse is sticky not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse i am returning this product even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen	19
0	the mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse i have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse this is not it unfortunately with this one the sensor does n't stand still my screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there the arrow jumps in all directions about 2 3 arrow spaces around do n't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse my old optical was better	19
0	i 've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light so i was happy to find this one however with my first eagle the alarm did n't go off amazon was great about the exchange for a new one \( kudos \) my repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight wo n't light up and i have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on i second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle the loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning but i put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough	19
0	this phone would not charge for us we had to send it back for a refund	19
0	i have this setup with my new laptop that runs vista premium the device installs ok and it works with media center it 's great for watching tv but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in standby mode until it 's time to record you may be disappointed when coming out of standby sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not when it 's not recognized i have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized because of this i have missed several recordings i contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby	19
0	why pay 46 75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer \( impact \) for only 19 95 at b h photo and video i have both the the dl 150 pentax battery that came with the camera and the impact imdl150 i ca n't tell any difference between them other than the price camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices	19
0	the new ipods do not have the connections to work with firewire so this cable will only charge the new ipods with video besides this this is a good product for the ipods	19
0	i purchased this from amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included however when it arrived there was no battery upon questioning amazon about the battery the customer service rep said he could give me a 5 credit for the batteries i asked how the battery could only be worth 5 he said that is what aa rechargeable batteries go for the bag is ok but do n't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers	19
0	after few months it just stopped working also it is not rechargable and need to replace batery every 1 2 week	19

0	i bought this cable to connect 50 plasma tv to computer when we connected the cable with tv we could not get it to display computer screen we spent 2 hours with plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection at the end at our dissapointment we found out that the cable was defective when we tried different cable everything worked	19
0	functionally the ifm is great i like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch fm transmitted tv 's however the construction is extremely cheap i bought two of them and both fell apart one fell apart the second time i used it the construction is so cheap that i could n't put it back together because the controls do n't line up i wish there was an alternative but i ca n't find one i like being able to switch between ipod tunes and fm but will have to carry two devices from now on	19
0	i just received the printer in trying to set it up i realized there is no computer to printer cable included nor any explanation of what kind you need you have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema	19
0	price reflects quality poor sound quality no features not that easy to use do n't waste your mone	19
0	received my camera today \( 05 22 \) and all items are not in the box i am missing hand strap ni mh batteries battery charger and cradle adapter worse part is i did receive a usb cable but it is not the right size and doesn't fit this is very frustrating how do i get the missing items	19
0	camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as dlink recommends i bought from ebay new and dlink refused to replace or repair so beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired think twice about buying dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty from unauthorized seller or buying used	19
0	there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger it works fine however the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me 1 the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case 2 the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100 better sound quality	19
0	reception is not that great with the stock rubber duck antenna and also the press to talk button and the channel changing buttons are way to close together making it awkward to use would not buy again	19
0	this mic is a piece of trash i bougth it and you have to shout to be listened es una completa basura y una perdida de recursos	19
0	i'm sure it would work well somewhere just not for our small business i put it behind an adsl router and used it to authenticate pppoe it was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected after hours on the phone with tech support from linksys and the dsl router people nobody could help while it connected it did work very well it just did stay up too bad	19
0	very disappointed in this phone i have an early generation uniden phone \( without answering machine \) that was a total joy this turkey has weak audio and ear piercing intermittent static if you bother to look at earlier reviews you will see that this is a common problem with this phone avoid at all costs	19
0	my cyberhome portable dvd player worked for all of 1 day it is unable to play dvds or cds of any type also if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs it will completely drain out within 24 hours i attempted to get service from cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty their support number is unreachable as is their support email address attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful this would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked purchase at you own risk check out the manufacturer web site you have been warned	19
0	product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web in addition no all region code supportted ! i will return it asap	19
0	i bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised 6db on the box the performance was worse than the original 2db antenna that came with my wireless adapter back it goes	19
0	i have just now tested my signal strength at various locations with the d link di 624 router 's original antenna and with this one the hai6sip made no difference whatsoever at any location regardless of its orientation it 's going back to the store tomorrow	19
0	i purchased this battery as a replacement for the original battery in my cordless telephone although i fully charged the battery upon arrival it will not hold a charge for more than 24 hours i would not purchase this battery again	19
0	i do n't want to rate this product since i have n't used it i had to though i just wanted to share with everybody that this product still does not come with a charger i received them left them unopened upon not seeing a charger called customer service \( they did n't do anything about the posting \) and sent them back a waste of time and effort and extra hassle and waiting to get the money back do not get mislead by pictures or descriptions	19
0	the battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only i am very disappointed in the quality we need them for emergencies throughout the day this is a farmed animal sanctuary non profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already i am willing to change my review if we get new batteries they came on time they are good quality other than the batterie	19
0	this product did n't work with my wireless mouse scanner and it would mess up my print que and i would have to restart the keyspan software to get it working again i returned it	19
0	it was very bright at first then button began malfunctioning i emailed customer service and never heard back do n't know if it was a problem with my unit or a poor quality button	19
0	this cheap piece of plastic broke within 2 months of me owning it ! ! buyer beware !	19
0	i have returned this item to amazon i paid 43 99 when they had it in stock the audio out on this dock is a stereo mini \( 1 8 \) jack the connection is terrible from then getgo with low volume distortion and noise when the jack is jiggled i would highly recommend the dock they 're currently selling at radio shack for 29 99 it has rca outputs on the back and excellent sound quality it charges and the remote has a menu button	19
0	i bought a 700 series iriver to use at the gym which came with this armband at first it was great but it did n't last there are two clasps which do n't sta attcked well and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use	19
0	4 months into it and it stops playing jams up and i ca n't remove the cassette or any or the cd 's wo n't ever but pioneer again	19
0	this was ok for the money decent sound quality however it died on me after just 2 months of use the usb drive still works \( sometimes \) but the built in player no longer works i found the controls less than user friendly and difficult to use	19
0	these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought i did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality they also feel like they are made of cheap plastic definently not worth the 15 i paided for them	19
0	i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability there 's nothing convenient about its need for 2 usb slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging if you 're reading the requirements for mac os x you miss the bullet point in the win xp section calling out the need for 2 free ports amazon 's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing two usb ports boooo seagate i'm offended that you 're offering such clumsy connectivity	19
0	i spent 60 on this and it broke after 6 months i guess the old saying you get what you paid for is true \(	19
0	do not by this product it has several issues go to the forums on the linksys website and see for yourself most people myself included have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis this device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the wii and xbox360 it 's spi firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall even in the face of the number of users having problems linksys has never released a firmware update and it does n't appear that they will	19
0	when we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the cisco label when we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and no tech support ! if you read the boards on the linksys site you 'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different isp 's and areas of the us since this item has been released please do n't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage you 'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through	19
0	after less than one week of use i am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection in 5 days i have had to cycle power on this unit on average more than once per day after it locks up the web ui fails to respond to connection requests it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power i have tried to work with netgear technical support but their suggestions \( e g lower mtu \) have been useless and their responses quite tardy if you are looking for a firewall vpn unit i suggest you pass on this particular product	19
0	after just one week of use and installing the newest firmware this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot by week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes this now seems typical of previous experiences i have had with other netgear products so much for plug and play my recommmendation leave netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and dhcp serving	19
0	this is the only card that has ever failed to work on my palm tungsten c so i know it 's not a hardware problem with my pda the handheld device recognizes the card and filez shows that the programs and databases are present and available but the program does n't run the only response i get is loading from card please wait but nothing happens my repeated queries to tech support via its web site have gone unanswered do n't count on any help from the company if you also get a lemon	19
0	despite what the belkin folk told me over the phone this does not work on a mac	19
0	after constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the belkin bozo 's \( support \) i received a long delayed canned e mail answer to my problem which did n't help a bit i finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a linksys network card both linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement no more dropouts i would suggest that prospective purchasers of belkin products hesitate before buying it 's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly but it 's really frustrating when product support is worthless	19
0	i love this minisisc it holds an incredible amount of songs the equivolent of an i pod mini and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great but don't buy it here ! just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by 9 00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here i got a hi md recorder instead of an i pod and i'm glad i did just do n't buy the disks from amazon	19
0	do n't waste your money on these things ! you can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent these things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory these headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable total p o s ! !	19
0	skull candy ear phones do look nice but it stops at that within 2 seconds of putting them on they hurt the things are horribly uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid the sound was ok but not great and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up yes they do look good but head phones should sound great and be comfortable looking good should be a bonus not the entire sales point i am very disappointed in skull candy if you want good ear phones for a reasonable price go for sony or senheisser if you want a fashion accesorie go with skull cand	19
0	installed quickly great image quality but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot i was told by others and ati forums that the 1650 pro with ati stock heat sink is known for its problems do not buy 1650 pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card also note this may be an unrelated issue after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced cannot tell if related to video card or not yet if you are wanting an ati stock card there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the agp 1800 1900 series cards	19
0	this product is not worth the money or trouble i also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up it was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up save your money and do n't buy this this would actually qualify for a zero star rating	19
0	simply put the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely there are always bubbles if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard so when you close the lid the material then transfers some of that dirt right back my resolve just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft clean semi wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster	19
0	i purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle they are were very uncomfortable from the start but i could listen to music that did n't last long the connection would not hold and if i did n't hold it together the music faded out also music faded in and out from ear to ear i finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less	19
0	when you buy a name like sony you expect to get decent stuff this dvd recorder failed miserably no s video inputs in the rear so you have to run s video to the front panel \( which my 2 year old loved to unplug \) nice editing features if you have the time unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done \( who knows if i will get it back \) i replaced it with a lite on dvd recorder \( at less than half the price \) and am very happy with it	19
0	i'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if i had used it i have found samsung products to be very good i did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my xm satellite radio subscription i already am paying costs for two radios i purchased this item to have more portable capabilities but i did not want to incur an additional charge on my xm account consequently i returned the product without using it	19
0	memorex changed the cases in this package yet failed to reflect this on the packaging i purchased them at a local office depot it 's the one with the patented hub that 's supposed to protect your dvds center anyway the two packages i got are no difference in comparison to regular cases i 've gotten with sets i 've bought i felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund	19
0	for the price this is not a bad keyboard here are the two major problems i have with it 1 \) the feel is nothing like a real piano the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note 2 \) the instructions have a big sticker on them stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and or birth defects \( including lead \) and to wash your hands after handling how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot very possibly by children \? it 's going back	19
0	claiming that this fan 's 3 speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling is very misleading on low the fan barely moves any air on high it still does n't move much air and is incredibly quiet nearing silent in my opinion if you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads this is not the fan for you the 3 speed switch is useless as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high	19
0	the buttons on the remote although many are not useful the only button we use \( to advance or back up slides in a presentation \) was difficult to use poorly located unreliable not a good selectio	19
0	i purchased this product to share my dvi monitor and logitech bluetooth keyboard mouse between my two main machines the exact use promoted by the manufacturer i successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping but am extremely disappointed with the dvi video at 1600 by 1200 \( severe streaking and noise \) and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise btw i am using belkin kvm cables do n't even think about purchasing this unit	19
0	not worth one star ! lasted about 1 week and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town it is now officially dead and useless even the short while it worked it was almost useless switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible do not buy this do n't even think about it	19
0	i'm sure this product is fine but do n't order it through amazon through ritz camera they just cancelled my order without warning having listed that the bag was available freaking idiots	19
0	i bought these headphones as a replacement for my second pair of blown ipod earbuds hoping to get stronger bass and better sound isolation i got both unfortunately the sound coming out of these headphones is extremely muddy and overly bass heavy furthermore they were quite painful in my ears the first several times i wore them and the mini jack has a poor connection often leaving me without sound in one ear do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones particularly if you 're looking to buy in ear headphones	19
0	i bought the terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some am and fm radio stations i was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system perhpas because of my apartment building or the quality of the stereo the antenna did n't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory provided antenna i did notice improvement in the static \( or lack of it \) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well \( they went from great to excellent \) but the stations that were tuning in quot poorly quot got no better with the terk antenna overall it was probably not worth the money paid	19
0	the software is terrible slow and glitchy i have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player the operators manual is just under 100 pages so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls granted the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual	19
0	we used the cd player one time the next time we attempted to use it it would not play the cd we ended up having to return it because it was defective	19
0	i am a person who actually uses these items alot after 2 weeks of using these headphones the right earpiece quit playing and i hear ms is not suppporting anything that stops operating also it is too expensive i am enjoying the zune but all the accessories should be a little more accessible	19
0	the case was advertised in a size large enough to accomodate my camera but when i received it the size was very small now i am stuck with something i cannot use your return policy was that it had to be in original packaging and unopened how is one to know unless they open it	19

0	i purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it the drive has a controller board error i contacted western digital for a replacement but they tell me that it is out of warranty apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it if it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from western digital with other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties i will never buy western digital again	19
0	if you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the att5995 or handset590 3 turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more not even close i do not have a hearing problem but this phone had me thinking i did the speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality	19

0	unreliable pile of 'you know what' worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up fresh batteries no go called customer service outsourced call center to india rep followed generic script telling me to 1 \) use lithium ion batteries and 2 \) press power nav simultaneously as suspected bogus advice fresh batteries metered out to 1 62 volts each 4 84 volts total yes i tried lithium ion batteries anyway still no go am still waiting for magellan thales to respond am still owner of unreliable gps still have about 400 invested in unit plus software and maps still kicking myself for buying a magellan product do n't do it really do n't do it	19
0	this is a great idea a small cd player to match the rest of the tivoli line unfortunately the quality of the units i tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the tivoli line all in all tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems one would n't play the disc one would n't eject the disc one had an led readout that would go blank and one had variations on all of these problems the model one is a great product and the pal and the others are close behind but the model cd needs a lot more work	19
0	setting this unit up has been impossible and i have not been able to use it i have sought help of dlync website dlynk phone support the have not been able to work me through it i have paid for a machine i cannot use have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up another person who has the same system with which i wanted to communicate has had the same problem and cannot use hers	19

0	a nice idea that does n't provide adequate audio quality in my experience the unit would pick up noise from the operation of my cd player resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks in addition on trips i had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations	19
0	i ordered this product and put it in my nikon d200 the product was improperly manufactured and caused the pins in my camera to bend rendering it inoperable i had no idea what the cause was and went to my camera store and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well we took a quick look at the card and the holes were obviously improperly aligned the damage to the cameras was repairable and the replacement card i received worked ok but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment	19
0	the one i ordered works but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit i received has a slightly flawed location the nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle \( outlet \) my nub is slightly too high preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet because of this nub it 'll only work in the bottom outlet i see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place	19
0	pny memory is not very specific on its products check and re check that the specs are what you need pny is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin \( not that others are'nt but \) pay the extra and go for respected brands like viking and kingston you ca n't go wrong in the long term it 's a better investment	19

0	do not order this item and expect to get what you see i ordered the super high speed card \( rpsdh01gu1a \) and what i got was a low quality high speed card \( rpsdk01gu1a \) seems to be some kind of a scam that ritz is running with amazon 's blessing buyer beware this has happened to me before when you order from one of amazon 's partners and amazon will do nothing to help you	19
0	i paid 35 for a barely adequate product case it does not securely mount or protect the creative zen it is overpriced and underperforms as others have mentioned you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player the set up feature is a joke you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product the design engineer should be fired do not buy this is jun	19
0	the product did n't do what it said it would i cut the power to use it in my car \( i should n't have assumed it worked properly \) so i could n't return it and ended wasting 50 i was extremly dissapointed in this product	19
0	it is very hard to update the remote very seldom we can delete and if there are two dvr boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on even though we choose the right one such as a or b software update is cumbersome and take 45 minutes on a intel quad computer with 2 g memory can supply some patches i have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless	19

0	i love the saitek 880 wired gamepad so i figured the wireless would be that much better unfortunately my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems there 's nothing worse than the few times i really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out i bought this and the batteries died i sent saitek an e mail and they sent me two new ones great they worked ! then they died soon after hopefully their new wireless which runs on one aa battery will not have any issues however this one 's a dud	19
0	after 3 days of having this controller it already started to have problems the docking station would not pick up charges from the battery anymore making my controller useless for the amount of money i spent i am very disappointed	19
0	i do n't like these radios becase they only go about 1 2 the mile the battery does n't hold full charge i would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range	19
0	i doubt that they are all this bad maybe i just got quot lucky quot the first time i put the tape in the motor could hardly pull the tape when i tried to record it played back all shaky like a playing a record off center on a turntable i returned it	19
0	the keyboard protector fits very well on my macbook but in the end i got tired of how much slower my typing was when i used the protector it claims it does n't slow down your typing speed at all but it really does you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so as i'm typing this review now i'm not using my protector anymore if you do n't mind how it slows down your typing then go ahead and get it	19

0	i thought i was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually but when i later bought a one off replacement not custom tank i noticed the ink level bar on the printer lcd was not only full but also longer than the other bars ! if the custom tanks hold only about half the ink this is n't the bargin it appears	19
0	there is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper the cartridges are not full ! i just got off the phone with hp tech support and they confirmed this the cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as custom cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4x6 photos in fact the tech support rep discribed the custom cartridges as having way less than standard cartridges less than 50 full on a related note i asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my new printer were full and he said they should have been full standard cartridges so this value pack is n't such a great value now is it \?	19
0	i tested this along with the neuros mpeg4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the neuros the picture with the sandisk is very pixelated especially with fast action sports like football and basketball the sandisk does have a better interface and is easier to understand and set up quickly but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor fyi i'm using a psp as my viewer	19
0	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just 5 months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player	19

0	completely useless only shows a digital display when ipod is fully charged how long does your ipod stay fully charged \? even when showing digital display does n't actually broadcast maxell replaced it with the p 4a for a reason amazon should n't even be selling this it makes me distrust amazon i got it as a christmas present but it was bought in october so they wo n't even take it back follow up after i emailed amazon they issued a complete refund which they refused to do over the phone now they just need to pull the product since they \( probably wisely \) are n't carrying the p 4a and therefore ca n't recommend it as an option	19
0	i guess this is a bad review owing to bad item description not bat quality turns out it is not a universal ipaq stylus set so make sure your ipaq is combatible ! !	19
0	this router has been in operation for about 3 weeks when it is functioning correctly it is a pleasure to use unfortunately it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running all the idiot lights show normal operation but there 's no wired or wireless connectivity until it 's power cycled	19

0	the bag is very nice looking nice material everybody loves it lots of compartments inside fit all accessories i need plus some documents but the top part \( the zipper \) is a big problem it just has to get 200 in a way while the notebook pocket does n't provide any flexibility i just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out very frustrating \( same as another review here \) my opinion find another one i'm gonna do it myself	19

0	i ordered this cable a few weeks ago although i must say that it does work fine the cable looks cheap \( in fact it is very thin \) and its length is less than 6 feet as you may agree length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that so for 20 \( including shipping \) i think it was not exactly a good deal	19
0	i bought an airplay2 from am apple store for around 60 other than the fact that blank fm stations are hard to find in the new york metropolitan area and that you need to keep changing to different blank stations as you drive the product itself is simply terrible even if you are in a parking lot and find a blank fm station the quality of the music the airplay broadcasts is very bad the bass is almost non existent and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of this product is not worth buying especially for 60	19
0	if you do n't use the printer on a daily basis these cartridges dry up only days after you stop given that the bjc 80 is a portable printer i only use it while traveling which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip a real money drain	19
0	i 've bought one of the 12c platinum because i needed a calculator in my office i do n't do financial calculations so probably i 'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics but i like rpn and the programmable features build quality is below expected intro key responsiveness is different than other keys' the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted so the calculator is slightly unstable with the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece disappointed	19
0	antec has dropped the ball on this one my power supply came in doa if you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply the case weighs 25 pounds it is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to california it is a pretty case with some well thought out features but not worth reliability hastles	19

0	i ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to amazon and i advised them why the thx 800 cable is not blue the thx 600 cable is blue i called monster cable and got hold of their technical support they said they have never made a thx 800 cable in blue amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue	19
0	the product shipped is not the same as the picture apparently this is a common thing for this item	19
0	terrible user interface you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features pulls multiple papers through so you must start again is a g3 which you would think would be compatible with earlier non g3 fax machines wrong so you ca n't fax to 75 of the community that has a non g3 unit ! i thought i was buying quality from canon when i paid 250 for this hunk of junk ! the cheap brother and hp 's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use and much less expensive save your money and save the headaches ! sorry canon this product was a disaster	19
0	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine and would n't do that but i was wrong sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating i would stay away it prints nicely but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes i see other reviewers have the same problem	19
0	i have always bought and liked uniden phones tried this one based on consumer reports recommendation and because i wanted caller id awful reception too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice good range \( which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call ! \) stay clear ! ! ! ! ! !	19
0	this is the worst phone that anyone could ever buy there is constant static and clicking in the background making it hard to hear the person on the other end to make it worse it only has room for 10 programmable numbers and only two choices for ringtones both obnoxiou	19
0	the range on this product is no where near what was advertised i purchased \( 2 \) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4 5 feet from mac attempted to improve operation by relocating mac using usb extension cable and changing id on transmitter with no improvement extremely disappointed	19
0	i was very excited to try this product on my powerbook g4 it worked the very first time but after a restart it no longer worked was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again it was fruitless so i dont recommend this product as i'm truly upset with its performance	19
0	first i rated it great and it was for two movies then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling the end	19
0	this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g even with the case removed the device does n't fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations i would think it would sound much better than it does poor quality product has too many flaws to justify the high price i'm very disappointed and i'm returning it	19
0	it 's a super idea but i cannot say it works well getting a free station is a real challenge even in the underdeveloped italy and if you get one but you are driving within 5 minutes \( or 5 miles \) you lose the signal however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel is not good for cars but works at home connecting it to the radio it needs to be improved	19
0	waste of time software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible i would n't pay 10 dollars for this product yes it is that bad accuracy rate was about 25 and the mistakes were beyond spell check they look like some new form of reformed egyption do n't buy !	19
0	did not do what it says it does only thing this does is remove large scratches no matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff i guess you get what you pay for wait no you do n't all i got was a jewel case two pads and two tiny packets of solution what a rip off did n't even get a manual what kind of advertisement is this \? i know the black market kind	19
0	installation express install is over 200mb full install about 650mb ! ! ! it requires you to upgrade to internet explorer 6 to continue installation \( how it this related to printer installation and what if i do n't use internet explorer i do not \) install takes forever is memory hog then tries to sign you up for some services i used to like hp printers i'm completely disappointed with the software to the point that i would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software	19
0	after nearly two weeks i'm still waiting for kingston to ship out replacement ram the ram was installed and after just one day the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning after calling kingston several times they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet it 's been two weeks i would strongly consider a different brand next time this company is not responsive	19
0	i 've had a 660 printer a couple of years and gone through 6 color cartridges four of them had a couple of the jets clog after 1 or two weeks running the head cleaner just wastes ink \( a lot \) without opening the clogged jets then you have the choice of throwing away a 30 cartridge you 've hardly used or printing with gaps i will not buy another hp printer i 've wasted more on cartridges then the printer cost	19
0	i bought this cable but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem do n't buy a longer cable than you need and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet	19
0	despite careful aiming this has exactly and i mean exactly the same signal strength as my cheapie 6 airlink 7db omni and is weaker than my homemade pirouline cantenna probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap but save your money if you 're expecting 15db performance	19
0	i was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop everytime i opened the lid a popping sound would occur turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing i took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed same issue i'm not telling anyone not to buy this product just be cautious and i hope you have better luck then i did	19
0	have used many types of dvd r this the only one i have found that did n't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable tried different locations on the spindle and the same results would have been a good buy if they worked gave it only one star because there was no 1 2 star	19
0	the alarms do n't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications they repeat twice and then quit the light does n't flash except the first time half of the time they do n't work i sent it back for repair and they did n't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day same problem it is the way it is designed but they wo n't admit it	19
0	the 3m privacy filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen otherwise you can see the screen you can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it all the filter does is make the screen a little darker do n't waste your money	19
0	i paid 300 dollars for a new magellan gps less than a yearand a half ago from boat us and they have already declared it obsolete if you expect any support do not buy magellan	19
0	anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds i know because i just did it the cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire you could even use household scissors to gnaw through having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer however if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer you might as well get something with a stronger cable	19
0	bought my go510 on november 14 as a christmas present for the wife it comes with only 90 days of warranty today is april 6 and the thing is broken for a few days it had trouble finding the satellites then just went dead it was never abused never left the car out of warranty for just 45 days 600 wasted it is junk ! stay away from it	19
0	pen does n't work as fast as i thought it would have very slow to upload text to computer i bought this for a law student and it turns out to be more of a burden to scan and proof the text as you go if you can type at a decent speed i would strongly discurage purchasing this product for note taking	19
0	these headphones have no bass whatsoever i would never buy these please keep shopping as there are better products for the money out there the headphones that came with my mp3 player out of the box are way better then these	19
0	followed the instructions to the letter pcs would not work once connected and even worse stopped xp starting up had to go back to restore point belkin email support is next to useless i would strongely recommend buying a kvm product from another supplier	19
0	besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned belkin support is horrible the automated system consistenly disconnects the call requiring going through their operator my 4 port kvm stopped functioning after six months there 's no information on the web to help either it 's as if there is no way to fix a kvm that does n't work flash upgrading is a joke i followed the procedure directly from belkin 's website so i had to rma replace it trust me belkin does n't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall go with iogear they include all the cables with the kvm switch for the price of belkin 's without cables	19
0	i also was misled into thinking i was getting ten of these tapes not one while the tape is ok it is absolutely not worth the price for a single basic vhs tape i am usually a big amazon fan but this advertisement is very poor	19
0	agree with the prior message i was duped into thinking 10 vhs tapes were being sold don't order this	19
0	the best thing about the magellean 3000t is the large screen sometimes this gadget works like a charm other times it just seems to pay no attention actually the touch screen function decides not to work you can sit there and touch rub hammer to no avail i got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to amazon first i called magellan 's help line \( the phone number was hard to find \) apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon if you hear a click it 's okay finally it works most of the time damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration	19
0	i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download in this day and age there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers a voice recorder is tool for on the go so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine \? this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company	19
0	it 's worth it just to take a regular size optical mouse with you this one does n't save that much space it works fine but it 's not comfortable to use	19
0	this is my fourth epson printer and probably my last the epson rx580 needs several ink cartridges if any of them is out of ink you ca n't print at all if you 're out of yellow ink you still cannot print a purely black white document ! ! the system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out i really resent that epson is taking advantage of customers like that	19
0	for those considering the purchase of this unit keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your tv menus and playlists will not the very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable is n't worth it get some 10 00 cables for your ipod and save mone	19
0	i would love to try this first one was shipped broken \( make a clanking noise and woulnd't work \) sent it back and got a new one that did n't read a dvd i may try one more time its pretty heavy but i am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i pod type machines	19
0	i purchased a sony 5 disk cd changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks this model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time what were they thinking \? the ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs a single disk cd dvd player this baby is going back	19

0	the picture is good and the combo was convenient however after 1 year the dvd broke now i have just a tv this is the problem with combos it is better to get components separately	19
0	poorly designed i slide my 2400 into it and the case is so tight it pressess buttons on my ipaq for me turning it on in the case cheaply constructed you can buy better for less check out the cases	19
0	so i really like this case besides the velcro basically i have it with me all the time and use it frequently the only thing is that each time i take my hp ipaq 4155 out the velcro makes the loudest noise i have ever heard and everyone looks up and stares at my case i would n't recommend this one i am actually shopping for one that snaps or zips	19
0	i bought this premium priced product because it has both built in voice mail and speakerphone the latter was the key feature i sought well it works intermittently just enough so you can tell \( occasionally \) that it 's on but infrequently enough that you ca n't actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation it reminds me of the can you hear me now commercials i 'd rather live with courtney than own this piece of junk one more day ! all the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well ugh do not buy this product ! !	19
0	i bought 2 of these and they are horrible ! youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse !	19
0	i used this maybe 4 times when the in stopped functioning but it mysteriously would work in reverse i wish i read other people 's reviews on this before i bought it horrible waste of money	19
0	we purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house with all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft at first it worked like a charm but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason we take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working then last week i added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke useless ! ! !	19
0	i placed an order for this kingston memory stick only to have my order cancelled without explanation very lousy customer service	19
0	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested the etch tore when examing the inside of the printer i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage the next new cartridge would not work either wasted tech support said to have the printer repaired ya sure \( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out \) printer repair would cost me more a new one	19
0	i was very disappointed in the lexmark p450 printer the colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the lexmark standards that i am used to \( i have several lexmark products \) i returned the printer	19
0	i ordered this as i have many items from amazon and had not received it after 2 months i cancelled the order	19
0	i have now been shipped two iskins for my 60gig and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place there are at least three flavors of 60 gig ipods in the marketplace at present and more coming it appears so be careful which one you order the manufacturer 's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin even if you know the model number of your ipod i also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake throw it away	19
0	i bought it and usb was fine but the firewire ports did n't work lost time and money sending it in for warranty service	19

0	worked for a month on and off and now doesent work at all	19
0	i took the tv out of the box plugged it in and nothing after pushing the on off switch repeatedly it finally came on picture and sound were terrific so i was very pleased turned it off with the remote of course the tv would n't turn on again with either the remote or the switch pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on i called panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone so now my new tv is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after i received it talk about frustrating ! !	19
0	these actually left my screen dirtier than i started with it left behind annoying streaks and film which i ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution i suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1 1 water and rubbing alcohol handy it 's cheaper and more effective	19
0	i have used this rw with my sanyo dvd recorder the result is that i cound not play the recording it wil freeze up and some times they can not be formatted they will not function well if they are used for the vr mode i have used other brands such as tdk or fuji they are ok	19

0	memorex jewel case arrived with many cases broken the tkd is has probably thicker and more duarabl	19
0	these headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect the battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder but nothing special as you see the price is down to 22 00 which is probably a good price for these \( unfortunatly i bought them at 50 00 and had to return them	19
0	stylish comfortable good sound quality and utterly useless at noise cancelation great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes and you 'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight perhaps there 's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box i suggest you insist on this sure turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise but as far as i can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume	19

0	i bought one of these about 3 days ago and it 's already broken i try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my pda not only that but it drains rather than charges the battery this is an extremely overpriced piece of junk you 'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you 're trying to charge into one smart phone pda whatever that does everything you want	19

0	the cables to go 4 port usb ps unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on but i have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the kvm is not switched to that device the video card goes into some blacked out video mode the pc has to be shutdown the box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error the box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc you must bo the port and watch the reboot then card is ok until next reboot unattended frustrating the keyboard and mouse are ok but with wireless keyboard mouse combo the box can not be on auto scan mode too many drawbacks	19

0	i own one of these it came packaged in my dell xps renegade sound in a windows environment is good as indicated by other reviews but in a gaming environment for example world of warcraft and not just this game i and other user 's have experienced the squeal of death wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal and may hard lock your computer either way this can only be corrected by rebooting check out the forums before buying any creative labs products buyer beware !	19

0	i loved these earbuds for 5 weeks right up until they stopped working the wires to the ipod \( the stationary wires not the ones that wind up \) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing for a while it worked if i taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case but quickly stopped working altogether too bad they 're comfortable the sound is fine \( great on the bus \) and the retraction works good	19

0	the suspicious side of me wants to believe that hp did a promo with their deskjet 612c i e they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements i would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612c black replacement cartridge c6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660c other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case	19

0	these batteries did n't last at all they worked ok in my remote control for my radio but on everything else the quality was either below average or just horrid my digital camera did n't even turn on with these only recommended with low powered devices actually i 'd recommend a rayovac or an energizer rather than these i know they 're only heavy duty batteries but the quality is still below average	19
0	the overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic the sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion the pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and does n't have a very good range \( very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results \) not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of otherwise i would not have purchased the item	19
0	but 20 dollars more and hideous i have a platinum intuos2 tablet \( a high school graduation present from 2004 \) and when i broke the pen i ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it 's being slightly cheaper on wacom 's site here the platinum is 20 dollars more \( and in my opinion much uglier \) i recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen	19

0	i have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired the customer services rep told me that it will be 110 for a repair which i can almost buy a new one if i pay the shipping on top of that 110 i have other eight \( 8 \) lcd monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality i 'll newver buy any proview products ever i will give zero star if there is one	19

0	i was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming and its response time did deliver it is more precise in it 's cursor control than any other mouse i 've used however it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me i find it 's side buttons are difficult to use they 're very small and their action is not to my liking further i was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using mac os x tiger the steer mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons i 've found nothing that supports those buttons on the mac platform to date	19

0	i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here but when i actually used for a few days i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter i would not recommend this to anyone	19
0	do n't believe the claim that you can just plug it in and it 's ready to use this product is set up for windows and the instructions for installing the drive for a mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the windows software it 's easy to become hopelessly fouled up do n't expect any help from western digital if you can actually get connected to them and your call is n't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so you 'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive their web site help is equally useless	19

0	this item produced and marketed exclusively for the iaudio x5 is entirely useless the carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself the only way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iaudio into the tiny case the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger i returned mine immediately if you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed ill fitting unacceptable piece of worthless junk	19
0	i just wasted 16 35 on this piece of junk it arrived quickly and became unusable even faster for those of you used to disposable screen covers there is only one in this package ! the instructions say you can clean it but it came out of the packaging with lint on it which immediately adhered to the sticky side and could not be cleaned off since the package was opened it could not be returned	19
0	this is a good product not as good as an mp3 player with internal memory as it is bulkier but it is great for the price the only drawback is it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory running with it can be uncomfortable at times if you are a runner you may prefer a smaller mp3 player one you can put in your shorts pocket	19

0	with no mode settings \( repeat shuffle etc \) or shock protection this cd player is pretty undesirable but if you 're just looking for something to hold you over then this 'll do it has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright it could be with just mine but every pair of headphones new and old that i use with it the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers they work fine like i said if you just want a temporary thing then i guess this is good for you	19

0	i find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable i would rate the product a zero if it were an option i ca n't even use them because they 're too uncomfortable to wear not worth the money even though they 're cheap	19
0	just a heads up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides you will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them given the verbiage on the box it caught me as enough of a surprise that i returned the scanner i'm not ok with deception like that	19

1	not as easy to use as a larger panasonic i used to own butotherwise fine good sound using cd player and radio buying via amazon as usual is super	19
1	it worked much better than expected the page clips also were very good but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning using the item \( i put it back on but fell off a couple more times \) i also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well	19
1	it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin	19
1	this is perfect for my ipod and keeps it totally secure while driving great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly	19
1	always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year	19

1	i had two unworking disks \( one a ps2 game and the other a psx game \) so i picked this up and both work fine now ! the only thing is you 'll have to run it through a couple times if you run it through once you 'll see little difference but for the price and since it does work eventually i still give it a 5 out of 5	19
1	i like it very much i use it in an outdoor trail camera for wild game and it hold several pictures and has been in the camera in all kinds of weather i would buy kingston again	19
1	i got this card last month and i 've been using it heavily its been great its sturdy and can has great range there are a few problems though 1 there is no case for the card 2 the included browser only lasts for 30 days and its horrible luckily i had netfront 3 1 3 memory stick lan software will occasionally error but a soft reset will fix it otherwise its a great little expansion card	19
1	i love my tooldial and its' software my only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively i frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in design a little overall great product and i expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs works very well in tandem with a wacom tablet	19
1	the sandisk reader is impossible to misuse it loads quickly and it 's compact shape offers most options for memory it can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet i would prefer a little more weight so that it does n't move around on my desk so i'm giving it only 4 stars if i had to replace this reader i would buy another sandisk	19
1	i agree that these are not top of the line but they are n't bad at all i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for 2x in this case it takes longer but i get good results i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd i would buy these again updated on 7 3 2005 i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what so ever very happy with this product	19
1	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it it 's the best feeling keyboard i 've ever owned the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past highly recommended	19
1	i'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only so so i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i'm very happy	19
1	we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback i'm not sure what everyones problem is it 's not a radio tower it 's a transmitter the size of your finger i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block	19
1	i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it 's biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an quot abc quot book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use	19
1	works great ! ! ! i have a flat roof that does not allow me to add a phone line and the only way to use my satilite system is with a long phone cord accross my room this jack extension helped me eliminate the long ugly cor	19
1	if you own a canon digital camera this printer is great it is portable and makes great prints people think they are from a photolab it is also vey easy to use i have seen other mini printers from olympus and sony and they are not as good they cost more too	19
1	overall a very nice charger though recharge times are n't even close to what is advertised the display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair the 900 mah hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless	19
1	i bought the sansa m240 two months ago and am quite happy with it it 's light weight holds plenty of media \( i have yet to fill it up \) and the sound is suprisingly good no complaints	19
1	the other effusive reviews are spot on the picture is fabulous on new dvds \( lord of the rings nemo harry potter \) a 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job we have the sony kdf 42e2000 42 3lcd rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination a few annoyances the machine responds and loads slowly but that 's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price and certain dvds of old movies \( some like it hot the king and i \) stretch the picture horizontally making things look squat i'm sure there 's a solution but just ca n't figure it out any tips	19
1	as your dvd cd collections grow these are ideal for protecting and storing your treasures easy to open and take up little storage space the center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease just a great product	19
1	excellent value these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price if you use a lot of aa 's this is the way to go made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the 18 range	19
1	very pleased w item compact easy to move from place to place	19
1	i bought this to clean up all of my kids dvds they have a ton of discs that are dirty scratched etc i have cleaned over 30 discs so far and have fixed all but one \( it was really scratched up \) i am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since i have considered this one of my smartest buys this year	19
1	just wanted to echo what others have said that these batteries seem to really last i received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it almost as powerful as the 2500s here and the batteries ran out after a few hours replaced those batteries with these and these just seem to last on and on am very happy with them	19
1	you really ca n't go wrong with this one not great response but what do you expect for less than 300 \? on the other hand the possibilities for this surround system are endless want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen \? how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system \( this is how my daughter has it configured \) it 's our second one first one died as a result of recent electrical storm \( yes the circuit was 'protected' but so what \) could n't be happier for the investment	19
1	this appears to be a good piece of equipment i hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well	19

1	i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice	19
1	i am extrememly happy with this one for the price it delivers well the voice recorder works well my key need was to record lectures and listening to them worked out very well	19
1	i 've been a gamer for almost 20 years this is the best mouse i 've ever owned it is fast accurate well formed and constructed i would definitely recommend it the dpi adjustment is a nice touch i prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy this mouse is just right	19
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs i bought this lens cleaner and voila ! the recorder is working again super easy to use \( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine and the menus tell you what to do \) highly recommended	19
1	it 's a usb hub all i ask is that it works it does	19
1	is it expensive \? yes it is ! ! ! however i was conecting my ipod mini to my speakers with two cables mini jack cable and power cable and it was very unconfortable to do every day the dock is a great solution for this issue now i just insert the ipod mini in the dock easy fast and confortable additionaly i can read easyly the song i am listening to	19
1	quick reader poor design it does a great job copying images to my mac but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo poo it stays on tight which is good until you try to open it the force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball groove hinges useless it 's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off leaving the reader exposed to the elements	19
1	great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your ipo	19
1	i 've never had any problems with memorex dvd 's or cd 's when i was ordering and read some of the reviews here i had to go back and look at what i was using to make sure i 've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones i do n't know why some users are having problems but these dvd 's always worked great for me and i record on average over one a day	19
1	i recently ordered this for a week long trip i was planning to olympic national park wow what a great find i did n't have to worry about how many pictures my memory card would hold and could just snap away i think it also increased my shutter speed too i would definitely recommend this to anyone and have actually	19
1	i bought these as a gift for my husband to watch tv late at night without disturbing me he loves them the sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable	19
1	the nike system has really been a good motivator for me as a new runner i need all the motivation and positive reinforcement i can get the challenges and goals are a good way to keep on track as well i did n't buy the nike shoes i use mine with the marware sportsuit relay set up it 's a great system and a lot cheaper than spending 100 for a pair of running shoes when i already have a couple good pairs in the closet both products are highly recommended	19
1	this is a perfect mp3 player i had the 40gb model before this and needed a bit of extra room you ca n't ask for anything more than this it does everything an mp3 player should and more \( podcasts videos photos \) i bought the 60 a couple of weeks before the 80 was released at the same price bad timing on my behalf	19
1	great price for a 128mb jump drive works perfectt for my daughters college work such a good price i bought	19
1	i bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my nikon d70 and i 've certainly had no regrets i have n't tried pushing the card to its limits to see how quickly it can write but it 's been plenty fast enough to keep up with me in single shot mode the card is always ready when i am downloading from the card to computer via my sandisk imagemate is fast too i like it so much i'm buying a second one today	19
1	must say that the item was better than i expected thanks to the seller and will buy again ! ! !	19
1	i bought this system recently after my panasonic dvd surround system broke i was a little leary about this system since other reviewers have mentioned a hissing noise here on amazon and other sites for that matter but i could n't find anything like this value and decided i could just take it back if i did n't like it well i love it ! the sound is great ! subwoofer is awesome ! i do not hear a hissing noise at all this sounds so much better than my panasonic which broke and that i had paid 100 more for	19
1	i bought it for my canon s3 is first i tried it without formatting and fill it up with photos and video and no problems then i did the suggested format by canon and it worked the same perfect fast enough to cope with the demands of the camera have n't any problem of corruption i 've been tempted to buy another one	19
1	the cheapest option i found at the time but an excelent pen drive small and with a good style	19
1	i thought when i up graded to the plasma things could n't get any better i was wrong the wireless is the cherry on top i love this thin	19
1	this is a good compact flash card this is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive	19
1	great item powered off laptop its fans work quietly to keep laptop cool so you can actually us your lap without fear of overheating your computer an inexpensive solution to preventing costly repairs wish i'd purchased earlier as i already fried my cd dvd drive and had to replace them good product targus	19
1	works like a charm the wi fi sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus ! you can get details of the connection i e connection strength ap name and etc worth every penny	19
1	i purchased this product 2 years back and it is still working without any problem i use the batteries mostly for my digital camera and have no complaints so far highly recommend this product	19
1	the initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures when i went surfing for another flash card with some depth amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent	19
1	my dvd player was ready to be thrown out until i saw this product on amazon my dvd player would n't even load a dvd it kept saying please check disc after loading this disc my dvd player has worked perfectly ever since do n't spent 30 on one of these clean up discs this one does the job	19
1	this memory card reader worked like a charm for me we 've used both sd and sony memory sticks in it with absolutely no problems	19
1	this card has all of the memory space required for my personal use i would recommemd it to others	19
1	overall this is a very good remote it replaced 5 of my remotes which is all except my bose which is rf controlled it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my ps2 with no problems my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions are n't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set up these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again	19
1	easiest remote to program has tremendous ability to tweek will keep recommending to all my customers	19
1	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it it 's the best feeling keyboard i 've ever owned the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past highly recommended	19
1	i used lexar media multi card reader in my p2120 fujitsu laptop via a usb 2 pc card adapter it 's truly plug and play without any need of drivers in windows xp	19
1	i like to purchase service or replacement contracts on all my electronics needs just set back and relax your covered	19
1	if you are looking for an inexpensive ipod then i would recommend this	19
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19
1	first i would buy it again if i needed to this 15 takes up less space on the kitchen counter i e speakers are on the bottom second picture and sound are excellent i e clear i would not buy this item if i wanted a true vesa mount to monitor configuration the stand not the monitor has the screw holes for the vesa wall mount not enough or clear info in the description however it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall if you need counter space then buy something else	19
1	i bought the intuos 6x11 pen tablet couple weeks ago and i use italmost every day so far so good i do n't expect to have any problems with it i used to have a small wacom graphire and i used for years then unfortunately the pen broke so now i own a new onethe only advice i can give to you is to keep it clean wipe it out every now and then with a wet clothjo	19
1	i love my 2 gb sd memory card i use it all the time and have had no problems with it	19
1	alot better then wrapping the neck strap around your arm or hand it really depends on what kind of photography you do i shoot at night clubs and weight can add up i have a canon rebel xt hand grip with 2 batties canon 550ex flash and 50mm f 1 4 or 17 40mm f 2 8it feels alot better using the hand strap	19
1	i have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months i have only had 1 burn badly have n't found a dvd player yet that they wo n't play in	19
1	i recently purchased this item and i am very happy with its performance and quality i use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight	19
1	these boxes are half the size of regular cases just right not too bulky like the regular ones	19
1	i recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office the reception on this unit is great bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations the sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in if you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound	19
1	this is an awesome tablet ! it has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator photoshop and painter the pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse the size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time	19
1	this device is great for carriying around with your camera you can review and share the pictures with any pc with usb available data can also be recorded and easily recovered	19
1	i bought a 1gb with my new camera because i was giving my other camera and it 's 256 memory card to my sister the smaller card would fill quickly and i 'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them i paid about 9 00 more for my card in sept and thought that was a deal now you can get this card for 20 00 that 's a steal for a 1 gb also i like the little case provided to keep the card safe when i take it to the store to develope the pictures love it	19
1	these batteries have been awesome my digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100 's of photographs flash recharge is very quick highly recommended	19
1	i 've been using these earbuds for several months now and they 're far better than the ones that come with the ipod they 're more comfortable and there 's so much more bass although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass my pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once and they still sound just as good as the day i got them ! \( i did have to glue one of the earpieces back together though \) i thought i 'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet but these things are industrial strength	19
1	i am a mild audophile and i love these headphones they have great base response treble and isolation if you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop do n't get get these ! you wo n't be able to hear a thing outside of the music	19
1	its really works fine for my items as well as my son 's toys we both are happy with this	19
1	i have been using memorex dvd r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player recorder not all of my recordings were successful no product i know is 100 perfect but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media this 50 pack spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping moreover i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon after trying many dvd r blank media i found memorex dvd r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance	19
1	not quite as powerful as i was hoping for but the sound is alright and in a small room it 'll do fine careful there is no plug in at the back so you can only connect mp3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack otherwise it 's easy to use and pretty cool looking ideal for quiet listening lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff	19
1	the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette mp3 cd and radio capability so did n't have much of an option but to get this one i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality overall i think its a good buy	19
1	i love this arm band i have had it for about 6 months now you dont have to take your ipod out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer i also only use my ipod for the gym so its nice that this arm band provides great protection \( better than ipod 's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on \) as well as not coming off while working out	19
1	i bought the 128mb card 8 9 mnths ago at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller ! finally it gave a 'error reading card' message and stopped working customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt they replaced the card is 7 days they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it ! i was impressed with the excellent support but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life would i buy it again \? yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well	19
1	i'm very happy with this desktop system great sound great reception great price	19
1	i am very pleased with this item it is fits comfortably holds my cd player snugly and has room for my id keys extra batteries cd 's	19
1	i bought this memory card for my camera sd500 at first i was very dispointed when i only see 1gb on my laptop after googled around i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb i'm able to see full 2gb after driver update just make sure you update your device laptop firmware driver first	19
1	same as everybody else i ordered mine a couple of days back and it has n't shipped i want it ! ! ! ! !	19
1	cool ! i can expand my single usb port laptop more flexible from single peripheral to be quadruplet i can plug flashdisk mouse external and digital camera in same time worth money for usefull gadget	19
1	i first saw these speakers at the apple store and i really liked the sound and the look i went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them as long as you have a decent soundcard these speakers really are great i have had no problem with them at all they look really cool they 're loud they 're small the woofer gives you a lot of bass \( which you can turn down \) and the sound from the speakers is clear buy these	19
1	what else do you need to know \? you plug in your pcs and a cable to your router and go i used a netgear hub for years replaced it with this linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately	19
1	it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin	19
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19
1	the mouse is perfect for games i use it to play et and is great the software provided by logitech is configurable in all ways	19
1	i 've had this device for two years just today i sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry \( not on purpose \) the thing still works ! ! i will not however try sending it into the dryer though beause i'm pretty sure that would fry this thing	19
1	i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice	19
1	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs i bought this lens cleaner and voila ! the recorder is working again super easy to use \( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine and the menus tell you what to do \) highly recommended	19
1	just a note to those who 've been having trouble opening these cases without breaking them if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together you 'll be able to open and close it ok do n't sand too much and just do the top knob or it wo n't hold together i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive so i wanted to make them work hope it works for you	19
1	the cf card works fine but it 's response is kind of slow compaired to the 32mb cf card came with my canon powershot a95 i got this card 3 weeks ago and so far their has n't been any problems	19
1	i do all my burning on a standard windows media player and it 's almost entirely data and music no video for my purposes these cd 's sound great in some cases it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat that may be a trick my ears are playing on me but nevertheless i'm a big fan of the memorex and they 're a steal if you catch the sale price recommended	19
1	these earphones are incredible ! they are comprised of excellent bass and treble you experience everything much nicely these earphones compared to the ipod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things i bought these from ebay for 8 and for that amount of price you ca n't regret buying these sensational earphones	19
1	just my two cents i bought these from the sony store for 15 bucks two years ago they 've lasted me this long for light office use so at 7 year this seems to be a good budget earphones i'm not an audiophile so i do n't need expensive earphones however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack the wires got loose and the sound just stopped moral of the story do n't twist or touch the wires cable pros lightweight budget oriented comfortable fit for my earscons eventually broke cheap earphone covers will get lost easil	19
1	muy pero muy bueno es mejor todavia que el primer dvd que salio de esta gira	19

1	if you snap shots in burst mode or if you want to take pictures at sporting events fast cards like those are the way to go almost no lag large capacity lifetime warranty no complaints	19
1	i purchased several of these cards they work great and as advertised the d200 has a memory buffer but these are still fast cards ! i have used them in the d70 as well	19
1	i use the memory card in my samsung d807 phone works perfecty	19
1	the one in our bedroom would n't always work could n't hear the kids calling i was unplugging my laptop charger at the same time someone was calling and discovered the charger was filtering the voice both my dell charger and thinkpad charger had the same effect even without the laptop plugged into the charger if your having problems i would start with unplugging other things first overall these have been a godsend wife no longer has to scream at the kids across the entire house used to drive me crazy	19
1	this is a nice product i buught it beacause i needed to play dvds from foreign country and my fancy sony dvd vcr player ca n't read them but this little thing can it reads all the standards i'm glad i 've got it	19
1	i was burned by another company with i bought their product and they did n't offer a replacement plan the item died and no one can repair it	19
1	great price for a 128mb jump drive works perfectt for my daughters college work such a good price i bought	19
1	i used to buy energizers and duracells at 3 4 a pop for four batteries now i buy generic alkalines at costco cost 8 for 10 four packs it 's like having a battery store in the kitchen drawer according to a recent coprehensive story in consumer reports there is only a little difference between name brand and generic alkaline batteries	19
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19
1	bag is attractive and very sturdy the computer fits securely and is well padded i recently used it on a trip and was able to place other carry on items in it and it traveled well	19
1	drive got to me timly installed per instructions and works wel	19
1	picture sound all great the only problem is that you must have an advanced degree in english engineering and computer science to set the television up without my cable company making a house call setup is impossibl	19
1	this mount is nicely designed and well made it fit the tv perfectly our only criticism is that the screws provided for attaching it to the wall were of poor quality the heads stripped out right away and it took a trip to the hardware store to get replacements	19
1	i read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially but when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network there really were n't any issues just following the directions \( and avoiding the easysecure option \) worked fine i would highly recommend this printer the quality of the printing is excellent the feature function set is quite high for a moderate price and it 's a great home office printer that has lots to offer	19
1	maybe beginning ones were a bad batch \? had mine months now and it works great everything it says it does no problems keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors	19
1	the cs70 is an excellent product easy to setup and use and good battery life	19
1	great memory card for the price i would highly recommen	19
1	this xd memory card works perfectly with my camera fujifilm finepix f650 good buy for the price	19
1	i bought this because i did not want to mount my garmin 350 nuvi to the windshield this device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars i drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard i can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag mounting arm separately	19
1	the item works perfectly if you do not place it near other mechanical devices i e tv air purifier elec clock etc fortunately it has n't alerted us yet so that will remain to be experienced you have to turn it anumber of directions until you get the best reception then leave it in that position	19
1	this is the best value you can get awesome picture with 10 000 1 contrast ratio my xbox 360 looks amazing with 1080i resolution definitely worth the money you would not be disappointed with this tv	19
1	i bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it 's worked beautifully clear and easy to use once downloaded onto my computer i used the olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews this allowed me to listen on headphones control the progression \( and backtracking \) of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly this voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time i had to take trascribing the interviews well worth the price i 'd recommend this combo highly especially to other journalists	19
1	i 've been very pleased with this external drive 500gb my only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it now it seems to always mount its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive the other thing would be that it could use one more firewire 400 port \( there is only one \) i do n't use 800 yet so i need to daisy it off of my smartdisk firelite that happens to have 2 all in all get this drive	19
1	solid product headphone speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted 40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed ! i bought this great little unit instead for under 30 good audio actually it saved my laptop once too laptop fell from 2 3 feet but landed right on the rubberized turtle beach micro which took most of the force it was bent 90 degrees at the usb connector but it still worked ! proof of solid construction	19
1	this is our first lcd tv our tube tv finally died my wife actually picked out this unit and consumer reports also recommended this unit we purchased it directly from amazon on january 23 2007 i wanted to wait a couple of months before i write my review to see if anything happens but to my surprise the tv is still running and there have been no problems we have digital hd and the pictures are great it took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast however if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat but overall its a good buy for us	19
1	this is a great product it was easy to mount and looks great the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches i have a 32 lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees this has n't caused any problems and i'm sure this is well within its design strength highly reccommended	19
1	this is a high quality precision made piece i'm very particular about the construction of things that i buy and this peerless arm more than met my expectations it was easy to attach to the back of my 32 lcd television and equally easy to mount to the wall i read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble not so here everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen all hardware is included along with clear complete instructions i 'd be surprised if you could find something better	19
1	pros like a quality piano the keys give a sense of weight the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed the mouse offers great control though i have n't much used all the buttons that are one the form cons the only gotcha is if the computer freezes there is no way to control alt delete also setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts	19
1	one warning for users with over head lights the 6000 keyboard that has tranparent \( light gray \) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right i have a light directly above my desk and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear go for a black key or similar model	19
1	after going through nearly 6 mouses \( including several of the microsoft mouses \) i settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back it also works with my kvm switch which is a key consideration the buttons are a bit stiff but i expect them to loosen up a bit after some use i highly recommend this mouse	19
1	they are everything the other reviewers said they were and i too ca n't wait until the printing is darker and in color ! wish it did n't take so long to print and hope the darker images and color only require an upgrade	19
1	i used two 12 foot cables with a coupler for a 24 foot pcm connection between my satellite receiver and my home theater system the dolby 5 1 is excellent	19
1	this is one of the best in its class for the low price quick and responsive and very convenient for a frequent web browser the back and forward buttons on it work like a charm and are perfect for the web	19
1	replaced my old 22 cinema display that was 5 years old what a difference clear screen flawless finish solid and adjustable stand easy hook up it took longer to clean the dust off my computer than hook this up !	19
1	i got this monitor along with a keyboard when i get home i plug my laptop into both and i have a huge screen to do my work on the colors are terrific the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen wish i had done this a long time ago	19
1	just remember to use the proper cable cat 5e or cat 6	19
1	i have this radio for two weeks now i am very satisfied with the reception of am fm and short wave very sensitive has great sound the only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations would buy the radio again worth the money	19
1	how can you go wrong with a price so low they 're good for both parents and kids to use not to mention they 're easy for young kids to operate ! keep in touch	19
1	i'm using this monster cable to connect my ipod to my receiver via an ipod dock and it works flawlessly sound is crisp and clear plus it 's a lot cheaper than getting the actual monster ipod av cable the length of the cable makes it convenient but not too cumbersome it 's a great way to increase the functionality of your ipod	19
1	within about 12 seconds of opening the box i was listening to my ipod on my home stereo wires are well made there may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever	19
1	not quite as bright a conventional flashlight but certainly bright enough no battery feature ca n't be beat manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind i 've never left mine on that long but i 've only needed to wind it once in over a year this is an excellent flashlight i 've bought several	19
1	i was unsure of whether to purchase this product when i saw that my printer \( hp deskjet 712c \) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews i tried it anyway because the price was right it may look a little cheesy but it works i did n't even need the cd that comes with it in order to use the product i just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new dell laptop and it worked i think i may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it very good product	19
1	do you have an old printer you would like to tie to that new lap top \? i did and at first i did n't think it could be done but a little quick research on amazon and i found this beauty the sabrent cable is very well made and has the look of quality and ruggedness i just plugged it in and everything took off without a hitch \( pc w windows xp	19
1	great picture great price superb fast delivery by amazon \( via egl trucking \) no complaints except for a faint buzzing sound on the plasma tv i have heard that all plasma 's buzz a bit this would not stop me from purchasing this tv again	19
1	i was looking for a tv that offered bang for buck so i knew samsung is the way to go except my wife was not eager as i was but soon after buying it the planet earth hd discovery channel show was on now i can not get my wife to stop talking about hd we love the tv not the best tv but best for the price nice design and easy to use	19
1	i have had my samsung for about three weeks now no problems i am extremely hapy with the picture quality and the number of inputs we also bought the 42 plasma for my parents we 've been extremely happy with it as well in addition to the television i am extrmemly happy with amazon and the delivery process everythin was handled very professionally the tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged i will buy next tv through amazon as well	19
1	these speakers deliver a clear crisp and vibrant sound with a richness expected of a higher end speaker i would recommend these to anyone interested in a good quality sound but keeping an eye on price	19
1	after reading several reviews on this unit we purchased it the majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to get in the game it took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it all i can say is wow ! the performance is phenomenal we have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works i cannot believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid highly recommended	19
1	not much to say here it works easily adjustable with just your feet feels good wearing socks	19
1	i want the dvds i'm making to last to as close to forever as possible so i did a lot of research before deciding what dvds to buy verbatim came out as 1 for durability i chose the dvd r format for maximum compatibility with various devices and i 've only had a few errors after burning about 75 dvds amazon 's sale price for these was great if you 're just looking for short term backup media i'm sure you can find cheaper but these are a different class of dvds	19
1	with my new lcd television the hook up was a snap and what a difference with the new hdmi compatible up scale dvd i installed the audio and visual difference for dvd and hd television programing is amazing with the cost at half the price at retail stores very happy and highly recommended	19
1	this works perfectly and it is built very well my picture looks great and sound is also great	19
1	wonderful for those who type and work with computers alot soft and comfortable ! i have n't had any problems with carpal tunnel since ! it did n't have a nasty smell as other reviewers stated a great buy saves me a lot of pain	19
1	this phone is clear and easy to use have had a couple and have not been disapointe	19
1	this performs better than the unit offered at the apple store at about 20 of the cost ! plus it has an indicator light and the folding plug is handy for travel good deal	19
1	this arm band is surprisingly good i initially got it for my boyfriend for his iriver but i was afraid it would n't fit his arms since he 's very muscular surprisingly it stretched enough and was n't tight ! he loves it i thought there might be too much motion on mine when i run or use the eliptical but no it 's fine	19
1	this product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly a seller ! will definately buy from again	19
1	this receiver puts out a lot of power it also has a bit of weight to it it comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound the remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a dvd player cd player radio and many other devices the display is nice you really have to read the manual before you start plugging away if you 're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up	19
1	i just got mine from amazon \( after a lengthly delay \) it is an awesome memory card it comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras i tested it on the camera and it worked great the real test was the compatibility with the sony psp no issues there the card worked flawlessly i 've already used up 600 mb its a must buy ! plus at 99 99 its much less than other retailers btw i ordered it at 104 99 then contacted amazon about the price drop they credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one day shipping at no charge because of the delay overall great service too	19
1	i use this 1gb card in my sony playstation portable and it is awesome ! the tranfer rate using the usb 2 0 cable to the psp is very good and i love having all that storage space for movies music and images i got the ultra ii because i had read that sandisk outperformed sony in speed tests and i have to agree the tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32mb sony card that came with the psp for an extra 5 10 i got the ultra ii that has a warranty and better performance i think it is well worth it	19
1	when compared to other 1st generation ipod shuffle armbands this one is just as good if not better and you ca n't beat the price definitely worth every penny	19
1	the bci 3ebk is good quality black ink for an inkjet printer i have used this ink for a couple of years now and do n't recall it smudging on the pages i print the price on this product \( compared to hp products \) is fair but i am able to print a 100 to 200 pages before running out of ink of course you will get more pages out of this cartridge if you print more color graphics than text	19
1	good price just not sure it is needed	19
1	the first one i ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the usb devices i was plugging into it although i had considered just getting a refund amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles the replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now the usb 2 is much faster than the original usb ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price	19
1	i own the hp 475 and since it 's slightly larger then the rest the printer barely fits in the case it does fit but it is very tight i would not recommend this for the 475 probably i should n't have bought this but i really liked the case	19
1	this cable has worked fine for me with no problems i'm using it to connect an inexpensive keyboard to a laptop	19
1	outstanding item plenty of room to carry dvds enough padding to protect the player but not too bulky	19
1	i wish targus made the same bag just a few inches wider my toshiba 2600 barely squeezes in the bag however it does fit and i was able to mount it between the two seats of our 2004 toyota sienna with no problems there 's also ample room for cords and dvds i like how this bag doubles as a storage case and a way to mount it in the car for viewing all in all a very nice product	19
1	the creative zen is outstanding took a little while to get use to the controls but the sound is incredible i bought one for my wife as well and see loves it i did spend a little extra money for better earbuds for the price that i paid for 8gb you ca n't go wrong	19
1	i totally love this cd wallet it is not too big and not too small the construction of this piece is very sturdy i 've owned this for a while now and it still looks new the color is a classic the only problem i have with it is that the cd pockets are very flimsy other than that the exterior of this piece is unbelievable i love it ! ! ! i actually bought another one oh another note do be careful because the if you do n't handle the zipper with care it tends to get caught but nothing major	19
1	these headphones sound pretty good but they are n't the best when running the volume controller gets in the way and bounces it is also easy to change the volume which is annoying i also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange i realize it is done intentionally but it does nothing for me overall for just listening at your desk or in your room these are great headphones for running i would recommend something else	19
1	i needed a way to power my laptop and my batteries for my camcorder as well as my digital camera this was done without a problem when my wife and i visited slovakia	19
1	i installed this antenna in my pawn shop where we keep most of our electronics running all day i could never get good reception with standard antennas and now this single antenna does the job better than any i have ever seen keep in mind that i have a full surveillance systen alarm syster phone system 20 home stereos a dozen or more computers and on and on the terk fm 50 has exceeded my expectations thanks joel dba pawn plus	19
1	radio reception in my apartment is terrible i have purchased a few indoor antennas even a different terk model but none of them helped very much i had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations and my digital fm radio only received one digital channel this unit however works great i get every station i want and the digital fm works great the only thing i would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky so if you 're concerned about asthetics you 'll have to figure out where you can conceal it also i did n't get any additional benefit from the amplifier but the antenna worked so well that i did n't need it	19
1	after reading several reviews on portable speakers i decided to purchase the sonic impact i f2 for my ipod it has great sound quality the case is durable it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere you can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive this is by far the best accessory i 've purchased for my ipod did i mention that it has a remote control ! !	19
1	contrary to popular belief i even had a good experience the one time i needed technical support a few random disconnects but overall a great product	19
1	they say it 's quiet and it holds tons of data they were correct fast access speed easy installation an overall fine product have not used the feature that let 's you back up your entire drive but we use it in our lan for shared files and it 's comforting to know that we 've got these files stored redundantly this box does just what it claims to do the warranty of merchantability \( from my old law class ! \)	19
1	very easy to assemble has very classic lines lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation hard to find add on shelf in maple holds a lot of equipment	19
1	buying from amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping stepped up for more power per channel stayed in the sony family \( previous sony surround output to center speaker quit \) dislike the speaker hook ups in back difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections overall happy with purchase	19
1	very satisfied with sound quality and ease of use before purchasing i did believe that these were noise canceling however that is not the case the foam inserts do reduce background noise enough that i am very satisfied with the result replacement foam inserts must be purchased online	19
1	i bought these for my dvd player they work wonderfully ! the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but did n't measure up these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies especially the dialogue the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever for those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds	19
1	i lost my monster cable brand m to m cable for my ipod and looked for a different kind and ran across this one at half the price plugged everything in and it works super good sound quality and saved some bucks hard to find these cables so i highly recommend it	19
1	i saw the small size of this case and was in love it has plenty of space for dvds and cords \( though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold \) it is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky it 's great you wont regret it	19
1	great price ! cant compare it to the more expensive monster cables but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components	19
1	for its price and definately for its length its an awesome alternative to it 's 100 monster counterpart	19
1	i purchased three of these for three kodak easyshare camerasi gave as gifts it was a great buy for much less than whatyou can get at any local stores	19
1	good sound and comfortable for the price like the fact that the cord is on one side and does not go around you neck	19
1	the best at this price like the color and functions mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized great optional backlight feature	19
1	i really needed a printer with a scanner so i could store my important files digitally this printer works great i would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster it can scan color also but that takes a loooong time b w has been sufficient for me scans quickly for those printout quality is excellent	19
1	good product great combination of screen protection along with a small flexable piece to cover the keypad	19
1	pros very inexpensive can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 playercons ca n't shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash driveoverall i'm very happy with this device i live in a big city and had no trouble finding an fm station with little to no interference i love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time the sound quality is good but not perfect similar to playing a cassette instead of a cd for the low price i ca n't complain though	19
1	i purchased this remote to replace a broken tv dvd vcr combo remote before buying it i checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo this was the only one that definitely could it has worked well a couple features are not available but i expect that with any replacement control i 've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered	19
1	i bought this card to be used with an ipaq hw6945 it has enough capacity for gps maps programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from sandisk that is supported by the ipaq the reading writing speed is ok too very good product for only 18 bucks	19
1	i purchased this particular cb because of the front firing speaker the size is perfect for in dash installations and it is very user friendly after installation i tested it out to 8 miles which was more then i expected overall i'm very pleased with the price and quality of this product	19
1	ive owned a couple cb 's and this is definitely one of the better ones \( the only ones that are better are substancially more expensive \) works great and can be mounted in dash because of the front firing speaker tons of features including scanning and weather \( which actually comes in very handy \) the only feature it lacks \( and i wish it had \) is the ability to hook up to a pa other than that its great	19
1	very very loud enough to make you 're ears ring \( thats a good sign \) bass is very deep and the silver volume dots on one of the speakers are touch sensitive like the ipod now thats cool great great desktop speakers and they can hook up right to your ipod worth the money	19
1	well made hard case that is virtually a necessity to protect the tungsten e2 which comes with a flimsy cheap flip case	19
1	great sound fun colored lights great design love this radio	19
1	we love this tuner and the kids have had funfinding out what key different sounds make they change their voice tap on things withpencils etc	19
1	i bought this mouse for my fiancee about three months ago and she has not complained once she uses it extensively in her office and reports that it is accurate comfortable and looks sharp	19
1	one lvel up from the es30vs much more capable of the last generation the es35vs is a versatile unit capable of handling all home recording needs and most professional needs as well remote control is easier to use than the last generation the addition of the dvi input gives it ease of recording from camcorders with a clikc of a button i am very happy with this uni	19
1	it was easy to set up and use our remote was bad out of the box but panasonic sent us a replacement we were able to record tv programs right away and then transferred our old vhs over to dvd it took a long time to transfer but it was worth watching the vhs tapes again to bring back memories	19
1	does exactly what it 's supposed to do i live 30 miles from the stations and have a good amount of tress surrounding my house but i still receive all the network channels and their subchannels perfectly easy to install too	19
1	i have this console for protection of master bedroom 40 lcd samsung 1080p hdtv and denon surrond sound 7 1 home theater system i have been very pleased with the improved picture and sound before hooking up to this console i had a slight wave going across the screen it is now gone as is the slight buzz from the sound system i also have 1 2 power outages every month from new construction in our area the console has protected all of the equipment very well considering the price and free shipping through amazon i highly recommend this console	19
1	it 's a good quality notebook bag that can fit 17 laptops notebooks easily balances well on your shoulder \( unlike some bags that rest lopsided \) good strong stitch it can get heavy but then again you 're carrying around a 17 laptop	19
1	i needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose	19
1	this antenna is one of the best indoor uhf antennas but is designed for uhf only many cities use both uhf vhf for digital tv to see if uhf vhf are used in your area enter your address at www antennaweb orgthen look at the digtal channel frequency assignments column if any channels are 2 thru 13 this antenna is not for you do not buy any knockoff antennas sold by terk they are mostly junk	19
1	the mounting kit installed easily and is holding a pair of bose 151 speakers it works well for what i need	19
1	excellent value for money my razr is a fully functional mp3 player now ! thanks	19
1	2gb sandisk is awesome i can store lots of files in my pda and not worry about space also the price was very afordable	19
1	a fast card which works as expected you do n't know the difference a fast card can make unless you swap to a slower one even a slower camera device will have improved performance with a faster card such as this one enjoy	19
1	this memory card has not given us any trouble very reliable product highly recommend	19
1	plenty of room for our hpa612 printer and a friend bought the same one for her hpa617 pockets for extra paper shoulder strap for even more ease in transporting the printer	19
1	when the room temperature hot and no one else wants the air conditioner turned on this desktop air conditioner cools just my 7 feet by 7 feet personal space it 's heaven i would n't be without this is my second order	19
1	i really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use ! ! it clips nicely onto my laptop or i can take it off it comes with a little protective case and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you 're not using i really like it and all its features as well	19
1	i bought these after buying tdk for the past 5 years and now only being able to get memorex at a low price \( i 've had very bad experiences with memorex cdrs in the past \) these were surprisingly cheap as verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands not surprisingly the discs lived up to expectations on my plextor 716a drive i have n't tested a whole lot yet but the ones i did test burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run there were no errors you really ca n't go wrong with verbatim just buy them	19
1	i exchange audio letters with friends and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony 100 dvs died and no replacement parts were available the sound quality is perfectly fine though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high end machine it comes with a stereo microphone but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit as it is there is a long clip on cord this makes it tough to do off the cuff recording overall a good value for the money the other machine cost nearly 300	19
1	i bought this so i can transfer video from my panasonic pv gs300 camcorder to my pc installation was easy and my computer was up and running in a matter of minutes the is a great value considering they include a 6 pin to 4 pin firewire cable too i highly recommend this product	19
1	i purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for herhp pavilion notebook pc \( dv5139us \) screen size 15 4 ht 1 8 wdth 14 1 depth 10 4 the bag is for personal use not business and use will be moderate she did want some extra compartments for organization this case has met all her needs it is light weight constructed of durable material well organized her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease she is satisfied with this purchase we would recommend purchasing this case	19
1	a great product snug fit on the laptop and appears to be a part of the laptop itself difficult to remove but no real reason to remove it anyway	19
1	i can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire this size works very well for small medium satellite speakers i am using this wire with a samsung ht q80 htib it 's working wonderfully and i'm getting nice crisp sound unlike the other reviewer my spool came fully intact i would suggest this for anybody looking for good cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire	19
1	if you zoom in on the picture you 'll notice that it 's actually 16 gauge wire i received it and can confirm that it 's 16 gauge wire works fine although the spool that 's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing it 's not a big deal though and my only disappointment was on my end when i realized 100' was n't enough to hook up my 7 speakers	19
1	this is a great little machine and has so many uses i bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled what 's with that \? keep looking and you 'll find this at a hot price again eventually	19
1	never having had any other headphones i do n't really know how to compare these but the speakers definetely work fine and i can identify different directions' sounds but there is a small crackling in the background that wo n't go away and i ca n't find out why	19
1	as headphones they work fine but the microphone falls off repeatedly and this appears to be the result of a bad design after the 10th time the microphone failed entirely and refuses to work i 've isolated the problem to the microphone itself as headphones they are fine but in you need a microphone you should look elsewhere	19
1	i received them ok none broken or cracked this price beats walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases i have ever used i like the translucent back better than the black ones at staples	19
1	this is great it makes it easier for us all to listen to the music in the car	19
1	bueno esta quemadora dvd muy buena recomendable para los usuarios que quieran vivir una experiencia unica es la mejor que ha existido gracias amazon por vender productos de vanguardi	19
1	before adding this antenna to my wireless router i had unreliable connections since adding it i consistently get the high speed connection i'm paying for	19
1	i was a little worried about spending almost 70 on this bag but when i recieved it i was so impressed i really love this bag ! very well made ! ! the crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows but i really like it to be honest i shy away from croc patterns but it really works with this bag ! i have a 15 4 in gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag	19
1	this bag is just pefect ! i purchased it for my dell inspiron 6400 and although the fit was pretty snug i am very pleased with the purchase it is easy to carry and above everything else is very stylish and professional	19
1	excellent service but i expected to see another model of the handbag it looked different on the picture	19
1	a great addition to the ih5 radio ! you could do without it but being able to adjust volume from across my apartment is a great feature	19
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your normal plugs for operating four devices most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money \( wires cables etc \) but this gizmo rocks	19
1	we 've only had ours a week and i wish we 'd bought it sooner the photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones i like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big hp printer 's photos which stay sticky for some time having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters to use in scrapbooking and to frame for your home or for gifts really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop	19
1	like the name suggests the m audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first however when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496	19
1	the only reason i did n't give this item 5 stars is because i have only taken it on the road once so as of yet i ca n't call it a worthy 'road warrior ' however it is certainly a great case proportioned well and good design with space for essentials would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17 widescreen notebook	19
1	i bought this for my husbands birthday he was very excited he had been looking at bags at a local store and had n't found anything as nice as this especially for the price plenty of room for his laptop and pens notebooks extra books etc very durable highly recommend	19
1	i love the jlab miniblaster because no matter where i go i can have my favorite music with me the sound is clear and i found this product easy to use i will be giving several of these for holiday gifts and birthday presents to friends and relatives young and old the delivery was prompt and i appreciated the friendly customer service in response to my questions	19
1	the cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the airport express this comes with a 2 meter rca ministereo a 2 meter optical ministereo and a 6ft power cable i found that both the rca and optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver i wish that the power cable was a little longer and i would 've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set the installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some	19
1	it is a good universal remote control i had several but this is the only one that could realy controles my tv wel	19
1	theis is a small manuverable mouse i especially like it for playing games since it is very quick i had one before and i would buy another if this one quits	19
1	i lost my original stylus \( left it at a restaurant \) this replacement pack of styli are just like my original i have none of the problems the other reviewer had my stylus fits perfectly and the telescoping top is just like my original this is a great replacement	19
1	this carry case is great it would be even greater if it had a carry strap	19
1	oem charger failed replaced with this one it 's more compact functions well	19
1	this product works great for my ibook g4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case although it seems like i'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen do n't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time though mr clean magic eraser works well for that but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard	19
1	i have both the 4 port and 2 port versions of these and they seem to work well with my dell optiplex 260 running windows xp my poweredge 500sc 1400 and 1800 tend to lose the mouse and keyboard and have to be rebooted but this may be a function of running windows 2003 r2 on them also the 1800 has a promise sata card which locks up with usb in general making this switch a problem \( i had to go back to the ps2 kvm \) but with xp machines it seems fine	19
1	the connectpro usb kvm switch costs a few dollars more but it really works the first time with no hassles i 've been forced to use cheaper kvm switches at work and windows xp never seems to play nice with them i use this one at home with two linux machines and a desktop and laptop running windows xp the switch worked the first time i connected everything together and has worked glitch free ever since	19
1	works just as expected switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop \( all running winxp \) each machine takes lt 1 min to recognize same as when plugging in any new usb device very durable cables was concerned about using wireless keyboard mouse but works great with the microsoft wireless desktop including the multimedia function keys version of the switch that i received is black not white as pictured	19
1	speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things i was looking for in speake	19
1	i bought this switch last week the installation was as easy as plug n play no major problems so far this switch is worth its price	19
1	i have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their black and white desktop printer so far not one problem the toner is long lasting and affordable great quality small desktop footprint does a great job with envelopes labels and even light cardstock i would highly reccommend to anyone	19
1	my husband and father both have this unit it 's really handy to have on road trips and to use while geocaching from our experience it does take a while to download map information onto the unit and a color screen would be nice but for 200 i think it 's a good value	19
1	actually i loved the philips acoustic edge an earlier and internal sound card but it did not like my older dual processor system because of that i was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper threading which windows treats as dual processors i bought the aurelium instead i love this thing ! i am a bit of an audiophile and this sound card is just perfect with my klipsch computer speakers it makes a perfect combination	19
1	a nice little radio good sound for the price i like the easy to read station indicator	19
1	i love this item we bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation it can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van the boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it i was glad about that i 'd recommend this item	19
1	the case was very well made and sturdy unfortunatly it was too small for my sony 7 in dvd portable player returning it to amazon was quick and easy i wish it would have fit	19
1	this is a great product for your mini the armband is well constructed from a neoprene type material \( which does n't slip when you 're sweaty \) with heavy duty velcro all the way around and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it the rubberized skin keeps your ipod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance this is n't a super cheap armband but as they say you \( usually \) get what you pay for this should last you for years of gymming running biking	19
1	very good product actually came with a bonus 8 cd sleeve to attach to a car visor for free very happy with the produc	19
1	it can transfer flash drive sd card to a car mp3 player that 's very nice i love it	19
1	wonderful holds all my songs holds my books on tape so i can listen on the road photos are large and sharp very easy to use and easy to download the dials are excelent on off and volume work flawlessly i have many products such as car adapter speakers external charger and external microphone and all work great i highly recommend the unit i would never get less then 60 gigs plenty of space for all of my needs on my recent trip to california this was the only thing i took for entertainment never listened to a song twice	19
1	this is my second one of this model i burned up the first myself when we moved and i accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it \( too much voltage smoke \) i found it easy to configure set up wep keys mac locked everything using the web based interface it worked great with our linksys media extender we watch recorded tv from our media center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device no problems whatsoever has n't slowed down my internet connection either i am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work	19
1	i 've been in the newspaper business for many years and i 've always used recorders at governmental meetings interviews etc much easier and faster than taking notes and it allows me to focus more on my subject until now i 've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event this little sony is the perfect size picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear additionally it has a long battery life and i never run out of room while i'm taping i could n't ask for more	19
1	out of the box and into the attic followed the instructions and i'm receiving perfect signals for my 46 sony hdtv set from pensacola fl \( approx 20 miles \) and mobile al \( approx 50 miles \) i did read the instructions and followed them i believe the folks that are n't happy with this model did n't read and follow the instructions	19
1	unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated this product stands in nearly every aspect the sleek supreme design by f a porsche makes this product appearance timeless and its preformance is outstanding more effective in this model than its smaller slower \( 80gb 120 gb \) counterparts the autostart is a little slow for me \( its the usb model not firewire remeber \) but is a totally acceptable feature for the price design performance cost benefit equilibrium excellent purchase	19

1	all of the pc to stereo cbales i could find in the stores were only 6ft long due to the furniture arrangement in my living room i needed a longer cable to make the connection i was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances the 20 ft monster cable took care of both those issues for me the connections are solid and the sound quality is great it was well worth the money	19
1	i bought this mouse about three months ago and i love it it works on every surface and the scroller works well too the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short \( about 2 5 feet long \) and it plugs into the left hand side of my laptop which means that i only have about a foot to work with although i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left \( good deal for the left handed population i guess \) some people have complained about the wind up function for the cord getting tangled but i have n't had any problems with that	19

1	when i first got a wireless network at home i purchased a kensington wifi finder it worked fine but as time went on i saw these smaller versions come out from chrysalis development i heard they were more powerful and more versatile so i bought one i was not disappointed since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car it fit perfectly on my keychain also it has a much longer range than the others but best of all it is directional meaning i can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the leds change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases what a great product i love it !	19

1	great item picture great sound great connection choices great one problem being located about a foot away from an under cabinet radio the presence \( shut off \) of this tv produces an annoying ratteling sound in the radio to eliminate this sound you must unplug this tv from the power source ! or optionally move it at least three feet away which in our case is not practical very curious !	19
1	radio shack wanted 39 95 for a similar item so at 9 95 this was a steal swr is good and performance is as much as i need for corvette runs although it hears well and gives a good transmit signal for the small size far beyond what i need i did have to put a metal plate on the vette \( discreetly \) as it would n't stick to the fiberglass good produc	19
1	the product shipped immediately a new dell ac adapter from cable4less i am extremely happy with the company and the charger 's performance as i needed a second one so i would not have to keep plugging in and out my primary charger i did n't think i could get such a good deal on a real dell product	19
1	without a doubt this is the best product of its type i looked at several others priced significantly higher and after setting up the am2 it was clear i had made the best choice	19
1	i have a 40 samsung lcd and wanted an arm that would both extend and also be able to hold 50 lbs or so this arm feels solid and does the job the tv has n't fallen yet one thing to be sure of is to check the size adapter plate you will need to connect the arm to your tv my arm came with a 200 x 100 but i needed a 200 x 200 plate and had to order it separately i would recommend this arm	19
1	i bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17 laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is the storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag i also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to as an engineer i must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop	19
1	i needed something to hold my ipod while i skateboard and this works like a charm never moves an inch can get a litle uncomfortable if sweating a lot	19

1	the mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking i use it with my apple mac g5 the optical tracking is great no moving parts the scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents i just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable less buggy i had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options functions and less bugs	19

1	when it comes to ink for my r1800 photo printer i am concerned with the quality of the images i print the epson matte black ultrachrome hi gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water fading and smudging it is important to me that my prints are of high quality so i do n't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges the color can be duplicated but all inks are not created equal third party options may produce a good print initially but may not hold up or last as long pros provides superior resistance to water fading and smudgingcons pric	19
1	this is the correct ink for my printer i do not buy lower priced substitutes it was great to find this on amazon at a good price and eligible for free shipping i only wish amazon stocked the complete set of inks for this printer which i purchased from them	19
1	while these recorders are considered old fashioned by electronic geeks they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape he still insisted he could n't remember anything but had to admit it was his voice and that he being the model of honesty and truth must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke very effective these old fashioned recorders	19
1	after 8 months of thinking these \( foam inserts that came with my e3c 's \) will last forever i broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty whoa ! the new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened my great sound and comfort was back and the decay was so gradual i did n't even realize what i was missing ! so 5 stars for performance but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs avg 4stars	19
1	i needed to have an s video feed from my classroom computer to a projector and to a tv monitor this proved to be the most cost effective solution to the problem it works just as hoped	19
1	this cable was just what i needed to connect my stereo to my computer 's sound card across the room i 've been converting old lps to digital files and having a well built cable probably improved the sound quality considerably amazon 's price was unbeatable too	19
1	opened the enclosure plugged in my hard drive connected it to my pc and it worked simple as that i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws but that was the only \( very minor \) problem there is no fan in the case which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself i am pleased with the enclosure and would happily recomend it to anyone	19
1	we bought this to use with our ws 300m to record a class we thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording in the end we set the recorder to mono \( hq \) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other ! good quality but distracting save your money and buy the mono mic the quality is excellent in either setting buy the way in case you miss it this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder	19
1	i received my package within three days via the super saver shipping \( cost me nothing \) the printer is great too i used the brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to hp and i'm impressed the printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up and its very light weight and small size making it more portable i love it	19
1	bought this mp3 player for my girlfriend for christmas she loves it it is small and easy to use the headphones could be better though the process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast considering you cannot hear the music without headphones and the headphones that come with it are not very good it only gets a 4 out of 5	19
1	i recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but i was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg it was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers she seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents the only real problem that i had with is that it costed less a few days after i purchased it but that 's really a personal problem	19
1	i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product other than offering more color combinations would be to make it bulletproof which it damn near is already a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory although 15 might come across as steep for such a small product the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds the 100 shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it 's category	19
1	the card works great in my camera no problems i would recommend the product	19
1	this card was easy to install and works well i have very little experience even opening a compter box making a spot for the connection to come out of the computer case turned out to be the most difficult part	19
1	awesome video card im using this with dvi cable on my 22 inch viewsonic lcd i must say it installed great and looks awesome ! ! great card for the money def a happy customer ! !	19
1	great portability good picture for the price i like the fact that i can plug this player into any tv and play dvd 's and also take it in the car camping or anywhere i also purchased a small set of external speakers which will really improve the sound onboard speakers a little lacking but overall a great value	19

1	this phone installed easily has good sound caller id is visible hooks securely that 's about all we wanted	19
1	since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone \( esp with caller id \) this phone is tops this phone and all other at t phones corded or cordless exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up but no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable given the other choices this is the one to get	19
1	i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case what i received is what i expected lots of compartments to store needed accessories sturdy construction pleasant appearance as with a previous review my only citicism is the shoulder strap while it is comfortable when used it is also fixed and cannot be removed i 've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane other than that it was a good purchase for the price	19
1	if only other computer products were this easy to set up and use highly recommend this product	19
1	makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands only thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier	19
1	price is excellent no problems but i falls below a 5 star due to product lacking higher quality materials	19
1	i have went through so many cd r blanks and finally found some with some good dye and have zero error burning rate tdk is amazing the first one i 've burned i 've now had for over a year and still no defects on the back of it it 's amazing	19

1	these dvds never fail i 've tried other brands and had miserable results stick with memorex and you wo n't be sorry	19
1	its great i bought it for my husband and he loves it the zen micro fit perfect	19
1	this is a very good sounding sub for the price i compared others at higher prices and liked how this produced a full range to compliment the other speakers it fills a 1500 sq ft room with cathedral ceiling very well i would buy another	19
1	i have three handsets and have programmed different ring sounds for each one e g then one in my home office rings with the three stooges singing hello hello hello ! phone works very well	19
1	this mount is perfect ! it sticks well to the windshield keeps the gps rock steady it allows you to swing to driver center and passenger 's views and back without any bending or remounting i am very pleased ! my roadmate looks a 100 better on this mount i hated the mount that came with the gps the build quality of this mount also seems to be very good i would highly recomend this mount	19
1	i wish i searched found purchased one earlier i'm a road warrior with laptop i work from home at times have a desktop this device is awesome to plug in go i love it better than a clunky port replicator for my laptop saves precious desk space i 'd highly recommend	19
1	at around 35 these ultraears are a amazing deal they have great base mids and highs the seperation is good too if you tweek your mp3 's sound you can realy dial them in push them nice and tight in to your ear to get the best sound	19
1	this is an absolutely wonderful product the cd player in my cadillac was skipping tracks and was a mess one use of this cleaner \( specially for cars \) and my player was good as new	19
1	i bought the cooler for my dell inspiron which tends to get hot because i work it so hard it 's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically is very sturdy yet light enough for me so i bought another \( wide screen \) \( black \) version for my hp pavilion which has more ram and so does n't have to work that hard now its internal fan virtually never kicks in in both cases the fan is so quiet that i have to turn it on off to make sure that it is working the only improvement i would suggest is more usb ports 4 stars because 5 is perfection	19
1	my daughter is very happy with the product she not only got the mp3 player she wanted she also got her favorite color pink thought we got a great deal and it has been working wonderfully infact my son is now jealous that his younger sister has a better mp3 player than he has	19

1	i bought the keyboard for my 5 year old son the keyboard is light weight and therefore easy to carry small and convenient for my son to play anywhere i am using batteries and really enjoy the freedom of movement i e not needing to worry about plugging it into a power source it 's an excellent choice for my situation	19
1	i purchased the casio keyboard for my grand daughter 's 4th birthday she really enjoyed playing it as a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day it is the perfect size for a small child she sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms the only thing that was n't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it	19
1	this router has worked great for the past year we have 3 linux computers connected to dsl through it one pc is at the far end of the house we use two novatech powerline ethernet adapters to connect that pc to the netgear router through our home powerline wiring netgear and novatech work fine together with no dsl speed degredation the browser interface is easy to use the firewall features are easy enough for the inexpert user to understand the manual is good but i would prefer to have a hard copy	19
1	this pny 2 0gb card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card we purchased the 2 gig card for my wife 's canon powershot s 900 elph to replace smaller memory cards although 1gb cards worked adequately with the elph we noticed early on that its 10 0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card the 2 0gb holds many more photos \( over 400 shots and counting \) than the 1gb at half the price of other brands the pny is proving to be very satisfactory \( we purchased two 2 0s at once \) we happily recommend the pny 2 0gb photo card for your photos it makes a great gift candidate get yours soon !	19
1	what i ordered on time delivery good price	19
1	these batteries last a long time cheaper batteries wo n't hold a charge after repeated use charging i have aa energizer batteries and after a year they still hold a charge with out any problems	19
1	do n't let the size fool you i do n't know much about audio yet but i can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is wayyyy better than the usb microphone headset i was using much crisper with out all the fuzziness and i did n't spend nearly as much as the online gurus were recommending i am sure the 600 mic is great but this is doing every thing i need	19
1	this lavalier microphone works great and is very easy to figure out well worth while if you 're trying to record an individual talking onto a camcorder	19
1	this is an excellent boom box if you want to be able to take your skyfi out of your car and put it in the house or take it anywhere it works great	19

1	this really works is very sturdy the problem is the bolts they give is too heavy for light home projectors just get 14inch screws from lowes you will be ok the manual is not good	19
1	i have been happy with these phones i find no problem with the sound no static at all the only small thing i have noticed is that occasionally the sound echoes a little i do not understand the terrible reviews this phone is very usable	19
1	i do n't understand the 1 star reviews unless there is some product variability price was 60 at target talk time is ok although the longest i have been on the phone is maybe 10 or 15 minutes range is fine phone works all over the house and audio quality if fine	19
1	buy it and you will not live home without it if i would rate this product i will rated a 6 stars	19
1	these buds are definitely a step up from the standard ipod buds they stay in your ears much more easily \( without the foam black covers which are easily lost \) the sound is at least marginally better and the overall construction seems to be better you ca n't do much better for the money however if you 're willing to spend a little more the jlab jbuds are the way to go i own both the gumys and the jbuds and the gumys are my workout pair and i use the jbuds for everything else but if you 're looking to spend as little as possible yet still upgrade from the ipod buds the gumys are the way to go	19
1	great product totally eliminates the need to constantly change frequencies in urban areas	19

1	the printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why i bought it in the first place i am yet to try printing photos because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting it might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni	19
1	love the wireless connection to my hp all in one scanner printer works great	19
1	the product works fine it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off	19
1	great sound love the volume control on the wire great fit to almost any head size or shape overall a great purchase and i love their product	19

1	this was the perfect tv for our needs it fits the space is economical has great picture size and quality and lots of features it is a good blend of current digital and crt technology not an lcd and bulky as they come but once in place it delivers a quality viewing experience	19
1	it pairs quickly with laptops bluetooth phones holds the gps module firmly and matches the look perfectly the only gripe i have is it does n't have an anti slip surface so that i can throw it on the dashboard and not worry about it falling off the battery lasts forever i remember using it for 6 continous hors before switching off mind you switching off because i had arrived at my destination	19
1	i love this product unfortunately i blew mine up in west africa \( my computer was not damaged \) so when i returned i ordered another right away i wish that it were a little thinner but i suppose you ca n't have everything at least right now	19
1	i could n't believe how great this cd case is ! i had a ton of loose cd 's all over the place because i did n't have any cases with this i could hold them all with a ton of room to spare !	19
1	i have used these seagate drives for almost 2 years now they work nicely for editing movies and i like the combo firewire and usb2 0 interface i trust these cheaper seagate than the expensive lacie \( we bought a box full of lacie d2 they all fail in 6 months \) or store brand drives hard drives are prone to failure but seagate has served my company well using seagate 750gb 500gb 400gb daisy chained	19
1	works great looks great no problems 22 monitor for this price \? more than i expected !	19
1	great product ! very pleased with my decision to get this over the 100 so i could replace my alarm clock set it up just for the counties near me and turned off all the alerts i was not interested in	19

1	ca n't say enough of this machine i view all dvd 's in hidef now and that is a beautiful thin	19
1	i 've had this for about a week and it seems to be working very well the autoscan feature is very nice since i seemed to forget to switch between city and highway with my older units the voice prompts are very clear and the automute keeps the annoying beeps to a comfortable level i 've had several radar detectors over the years and this one certainly seems to be the best so far it is also rated very highly in the amgazine articles i found	19
1	i have used these batteries in a variety of applications and find they perform very well can tell no difference in their performance vs the name brands	19
1	this is simply the best remote you will ever need for all your infarad remotes ! i have a chinese satallite receiver that i could never get it to work with all other universal remotes i was able to teach this remote to work with it ! this is a small computer	19

1	this notebook case is a perfect fit for the macbook and it is compact enough to fit into larger bags it is exactly what i was looking for	19
1	this was a perfect fit for my 13 macbook tried a couple cheaper ones but was never satisfied usually they were just a bad fit this is by far the best holds the computer in place and is light weight it 's true you get what you pay for one complaint the extra pocket in front could be larger	19
1	i originally bought this cd case for my car because i listen to cds the most while driving this was not a good case to bring back and forth at all it is very large and heavy \( even without cds ! \) and the long zipper tail makes it hard to open with one hand i now use it to house computer software and playstation gamecube games for what you pay it is an excellent buy	19
1	seems pretty good doesnt come with any directions on how to transfer files from your c drive into it	19
1	this is a great value for money and it is very silent and soen not get hot it is also silent and convenient it is more flexible with the fat 32 format it comes in but i preferred the ntfs file format whice is safer and more stable it was no problem to reformat to ntfs	19
1	this was exactly what i needed it is very easy to use it does a great job of encrypting your data if that is what you want there is plenty of space and it is snap to use with my mac powerbook i recommend it	19
1	this product is fantastic great sound with a small footprint i purchased a jbl on stage at first and it malfunctioned after only a few days the cta product has been great and it cost a lot less than the jbl product	19
1	i got the griffin itrip to enjoy my ipod in my car and then i had to get a belkin tunebase for ipod mini ! with the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the itrip the tunebase keeps my ipod charged so that i do n't have to plug it into my computer 's usb port every night after work	19
1	i'm very pleased with my iriver i have tons of room to store all my favorite songs and even sermons ! i do a lot of driving and i listen to it all the time	19
1	this is my second iriver product the first one was fine but it could n't survive a trip through the washing machine this one works well is easy to navigate through good sound the case is rather cheap the other one was rigid plastic this case is hard to use and makes it difficult to change the batteries the software leaves something to be desired so i use windows explorer to add songs and rearrange the order all in all this is a great little mp3 player	19
1	i use this on my macbook works flawlessly to hookup a tv via svideo osx handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that i use when i have it hooked up plug it in and video switches to tv settings unplug it and its back to normal i use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook and i just get extra desktop space when i plug the tv in the quality is quite suprising for s video very good 100 must have for anyone that has a nice tv	19
1	it works fine but it gets really annoying when you 're using it with a widescreen mac and a widescreen tv the zoom function most plasmas and lcd tvs have is 16 9 aspect ratio whereas macs are at 16 10 aspect ratio so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you 're trying to display or have massive letter boxing after three months i still have n't had any glitches that were this adapter 's fault if you have hdmi or dvi on your tv or projector do n't bother with this go straight to dvi with a mini dvi to dvi adapter then get a dvi to dvi cord or a dvi to hdmi cord	19
1	ya tengo una semana con el y lo recomiendo ampliamente la imagen y la nitidez de este monitor son sobresalientes con una resolucion de 1680 x 1050 las fotos tomadas con mi camara digital se ven como una imagen real tiene varios ajustes segun el uso que le quieras dar viene en espa ol	19

1	i have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints one of my laptops only has a usb 1 x port and it is incredibly slower for backups that has no reflection on this product but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have usb 2 x and do n't blame it on this drive	19
1	this product is perfect for anyone who has a thumb drive but no lanyard or other item already attached to it i could not find anything like this at any of the big stores i e circuit city hh gregg etc i hopped online and found this right away thanks	19
1	i love the sling media slingbox tuner ! the install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews the quality of picture is just as good as on my cable tv i have a great processor with the highest internet speed i could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color i get with it and may also be the reason i have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time plue my shipment from amazon was in 2 days ! you rock amazon !	19
1	i am very pleased with the brother p tough ql 500 the printing lables are a good price for the quantity you get	19
1	i bought this like a ipod but its better i have about 20 movies on it and about 500 songs and some photo's and still have 50 gigs left the only hang up is you still have to go pay another 20 00 to get the plug in download that lets you show most of the movies they say it can do all this stuff but not with out downloads and some add on's once you get all that there are hours of fun to be had	19
1	excellent product very ergonomic easy to set up and use ! wireless works great i would recommend this product	19

1	after all the hype on line about the t amp i had to check it out for myself all the reports are true ! this is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price if you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it this amp is for you you will not be disappointed i recommend purchasing the ac power supply as well you can find others cheaper but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the t amp remains valid	19
1	great sound form small box nice platform for tweaking good power needed	19
1	ha sido una buena compra es un procesador rapido y efeciente en las tareas multimedia	19
1	i purchased this as an extra phone so i could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house well built with hold and 3 way conferencing features sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line powered from the phone line no external power is used one drawback the line indicator does n't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house	19
1	i wanted something to use while mowing the lawn without emptying my bank account cuts the lawnmower noise to a tolerable level and the sound quality is decent headphones are comfortable and adjust easily unit collapses down to a more manageable size for transportation good battery life	19
1	yep everything is very cool clarity etc but they should do something about clipping in the head of laptop it is just dancing while i keep it on laptop	19
1	recently bought this receiver to replace a dead one there is n't really anything special about this receiver but it a solid one the two year warranty tells me they stand by their product in case of a problem \( hopefully i wo n't need to use the warranty \) it gives good clean power and sound do n't let the 75w channel fool you this is a high current receiver and it has a good amount of power time will tell however how well this receiver performs also for the price amazon was selling for i could n't pass it up	19
1	unit installed in seconds with no false starts or headaches of any kind the base is wide and heavy and when placed on a mouse pad does n't move around at all even when i get a little too into my flight sim games one ca n't beat the price either for flying prop planes i am very saisfied with the performance	19
1	first time i 've ever written a review i'm not a high tech type and sometimes it 's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff this remote was a breeze to program and works fantastic my wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it any problems with use just press help and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem highly recommended	19
1	i bought this cd player to use in my car and it has worked beautifully ! when you consider what a fine cd player it is and the incredibly low price it is most certainly a best buy !	19
1	plenty of room for my creative zen nano player ear buds and spare battery i only wish for something other than black ! it is easy to misplace	19
1	works as advertised and works really well i purchased it to provide a serial port for a virtual windows machine running inside mac os x i used to have issues with other products but not this one	19
1	needed the adapter to charge my shuffle since the ac adapter i have is one of those older apple ones with the firewire connector suits my needs perfectly no experience with any sound docks however so i ca n't comment on the performance flaws other people have brought up	19
1	great headphones for running ! they fit my ears perfectly and i do n't have to worry about foam anymore	19
1	plugged right in and worked like a charm no software to configure great buy great product	19
1	portable easy to use with any chip and really nice pix i love being able to print from digital files on my ipod	19
1	just purchased earbuds at target excellent sound quality expected that much due to a previous of full headphones even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear well worth my 100 dollars granted i 've only had them 5 to 10 minutes but i wo n't be returning them any time soon	19
1	bought it for my wife and she loves it it keeps track of where you were and restarts from there the display is small \( no fancy menus like ipod \) but works well sound is excellent be sure to install the drivers and software the software is small simple and easy to use or you can just copy paste files onto it if you don't install the drivers it only works at usb 1 1 speeds and takes a lot longer to load songs with drivers you get full 2 0 speeds	19
1	i 've never had a problem with these dvds they burn and play perfectly and i 've never had a problem printing on them what 's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole it does n't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds by the way i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds	19
1	this bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my apple notebook be sure to insert the bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin i thought mine was in far enough at first but it really was n't one caveat i was hoping that the bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room but it 's not also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both bluetooth and cable at the same time	19
1	works well for my mac and bt enabled sony ericsson phone other than the built in drivers for the printer in mac osx support for options within the card and printer are non existant still cant figure out how to manually force a realignment of the cartridges	19
1	i purchased the hawking hwu8dd on the recommendation of several other rvers wifi signals at rv parks tend to be unreliable until now the built in antenna on my laptop could see the signal at my park but could not access it as soon as i installed the software and connected the hawking antenna via usb port i immediately accessed my campground 's signal the hawking antenna has solved a major problem for me	19
1	these were double the price on another site ! my little girl loves these speakers ! she is using them with her pc my only complaint and it 's my complaint and not my lil girl 's is that the sound quality is poor obviously not the speakers to get for real sound quality but kids love them	19
1	my doctor recommended getting a wrist support when using my computer because i had previous carpal tunnel surgery ilove the way it comforts the wrist the gel inside is different than other gel pads i had in the past it really does give great support and comfort it can prevent future problems for your wrist iam glad amazon carries it	19
1	i just made a long trip from miami florida all the way to s carolina with a explorist xl loaded with directroute v3 everything worked just fine i installed the software unlock it upload the maps all with out any problems the unit was very fast and accuracy did n't need to keep it over the dashboard from inside the vehicle worked very well never took more than a minute to track all satellites the street route where very accurate never got lost working with poi 's was very simple did n't have any problem handling very large maps i really recommend this unit	19
1	does the job nicely i am not an audiophile so i dont get into the nit picking when it comes to speaker wire just tell me what gauge to use and i do it seemed high quality to me	19
1	this bag is very good the outside phone jack is a plus the only negative hard to access the other dvd 's when in use	19
1	arrived on time and is perfect for using headphones and speakers at the same time	19
1	i also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by sony this 7 1 channel home theater with hdmi passthrough is a great machine that money can buy if you are looking for quality surround sound in your livingroom or your own home theater this s the product you should invest in this is a great investment for me i am glad i found it in amazon	19
1	this is a solid device and i like the included software for burningb dvd as well as c	19
1	i have n't had any problems using this dvd cd burner over firewire on a g4 imac running mac osx tiger in fact setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual it was truly plug and play minor quibbles the open close button is hard to reach when the disc tray is extended the black plastic face of the drive looks cheesy compared to the cool aluminum case and only the lite version of toast 6 is included bottom line i would buy this burner again given my experiences using it	19
1	the product works great what i did n't like was not having the attachment to charge the battery in my home it only came with the cigarette lighter power source i had to purchase the other power source seperately i also had purchased the 3000 model previously and it came with both power sources why is that	19
1	the cam is good it has a special feature to show the person object by automatic adjustment and a very good part abt it is it has a built in mike and helps a lot	19
1	bought these stands after much research was looking for a good stand at a fair price these serve the purpose great stand great price	19
1	i bought this sd card and took some 100 snaps out of it the card is really fast with my canon a510 camera reading takes a slightly longer time than writing i would recommend this card to anyone actually this card outperforms the 16mb mmc supplied with the camera also the 256mb card will hold upto 200 \( may be lesser \) 3 2mp pictures	19
1	i purchased this card a month ago i use it on my dell axim x3i so far it has been fully compatible fast and flawless i have n't owned another pda or sd card so i ca n't give you a first hand benchmark but i can say that accessing the card is quick and i have not had any skips while playing my music files the 256mb is good for the price if you wait for amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer 's rebate	19
1	i got my replacement battery and put into the computer the date started working whenever the computer is off and i have n't had any problems	19
1	the klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long i researched dockable ipod mp3 players for a few months before i decided on this one for my wife 's office i'm fussy when it comes to quality audio equipment the i grove does not disappoint it provides room filling sound with no distorion i listened to it extensively before wrapping it up for xmas to make sure it had the quality i insist on it delivered another bonus with the klipsch is it 's ability to accomodate other mp3 players and or personal compact disc players i'm completely satisfied with my purchase of the klipsch i groove	19
1	i'm sure these earphones work and sound fine but i was looking for something softer smaller for my apparently small earholes	19
1	i purchased this for my teenager to use with her ipod nano i shopped around for a while before i finally decided on this one because it came with losts of accesories and she uses it everyday all the time and says it works perfectly i 've only had it for a month but it 's holding up in the hands to a teen and no complaints so far	19
1	we love the card scanner it 's the best everyone who is a recruiter should have one it saves time and space	19
1	i have and have had lots of sw radios including a number of sonys this is one of their many gems great perfomance lots of memories and snazzy look good for travel \( certainly not as compact as the sw100 of course \) a great radio to consider if you only want one shortwave radio and do n't want to spend very much good for listening and good for dxing while traveling look no further	19
1	good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device my major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and i would not use it it is just right and great protection for my 1955 by the way i replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen it is a great piece of protection	19
1	what can i say it 's an ink cartridge you get a lot of pages out of it its great quality and thats about it	19
1	i ca n't describe this mp3 with words great it 's more than great it fits my pocket and it 's music quality is great my sister and i bought this incredible mp3 with doubts but it is more than great if somebody is considering buying an mp3 i strongly recommend to buy this iriver thank you thank you thank you	19
1	these speakers can almost hit any range of sound but if anything they are a little weak on the bass side they put out very crisp sound for my system you might want to add a sub to them for complete range sound	19
1	if you 're looking at this page you probably already know a lot about hp calculators chances are you either had a 32sii and do n't want to go the ebay route or wanna slim down from that 48 49 series because you do n't really need that extra functionality is the 33s perfect \? no not by a long ways but it 's the best thing we 've got if you want a new scientific rpn calculator this is it	19
1	this battery will transform your epson picturemate deluxe viewer edition from a nifty little photo printer into an absolute must have item ! i take it with me when ever i'm doing an off site photo shoot or even when i'm out for a weekend shooting candids the portability you get by adding this battery to the printer is priceless i have printed as many as 40 photos on one charge	19
1	how often are you on the way to work or to a meeting and you end up getting stuck in the traffic jam of the century nobody is moving and you can tell it 's going to be a while it would make sense to brush up on those reports or your presentation while you 're stuck but who wants to eat up the battery on their laptop right before a presentation \? this inverter allows you to plug in your laptop into your car just like a wall outlet no worries work off your car 's alternator instead of your battery and catch all your typos before you get to your appointment	19

1	what can i say i got a code at chrismas time through the amazon promotion and got this tv for 200 it 's perfect for a master bedroom set and the picture is great why spend so much more than the regular amazon price for a more expensive brand when you can get this tv \? no problems and it works wonderfully ! great deal with free shipping even ! time and again amazon is great	19
1	i purchase this on amazon for 499 no tax free shipping you can not match this quality at this price the hd with hdmi cable using comcast digital box is outstanding the sound is also better with the hdmi vs componet cables the jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode the picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color i looked at samsung for 800 and i am glad i saved myself 300 with this lcd	19
1	i use an i pod mini in my car it is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input i used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off the air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that i leave in a tray outside the console it works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all it solved my problem and i am a very satisfied customer	19

1	i 've had canon printers using this cartridge for more than a year and wo n't settle for any of those knock offs yeah they 're often much cheaper but this is one area where you get what you pay for brand x fades and does not perform as well in the inkjet system this has been confirmed in independent lab tests in a leading pc magazine i have had to install and remove countless cartridges and never spilled a drop the pop in pop out design could n't be easier	19

1	the apple airport card network adapter airport 802 11b was a fabulous purchase it did exactly what it was supposed to was easy to install and test worked immediately the vendor that supplied the airport card was prompt efficient courteous and careful in the packaging very happy with the product	19
1	this card is great for the seamless apple look and feel \( and only option for internal in imac ibook pb \) but it is way overpriced now that it is out of production there are other options belkin f5d6050 usb b adapter has drivers for 9 2 and osx several manufacturers \( e g certain belkin linksys microsoft \) pci cards have airport extreme chipsets \( broadcom \) on them that osx reads as a real airport xtreme card you need to do your research and some cards have different chipsets in different revisions but it is pretty easy overall and you can save 100	19
1	i had been using my air conditioning vents to hold my xm radio and this was recommended to me through a friend it 's super easy to install and works great it does n't move or shake while driving and is adjustable height wise to fit most car setups it was well worth the money and in the summer heat i am glad i bought it and got my extra air conditioning vent back	19
1	nothing much to report they were as advertised and fulfilled my need	19
1	the thing that seperates this dvd case from the rest is it 's center lock design it 's secures the disc nicely without damaging it like i have had others do worth the extra dough to have a quality product \( now if only their memorex 's software was as good !	19
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your normal plugs for operating four devices most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money \( wires cables etc \) but this gizmo rocks	19
1	the tapes are exactly what i had searched the web for thanks to amaxon com for listing the seler	19
1	the sony str dg600 7 1 has worked as expected and is a high quality system at a great price	19
1	these ear buds provide a very good fit they block out a lot of external noise much better than my previous ear buds the sound is clear with good bass definitely worth the price	19
1	this salamander designs rack is very well made and looks great it takes a few hours to assemble but the result is nicer than most home theater furniture out there unfortunately amazon 's shipping \( via ups \) did n't go so well and the outer box arrived in very bad shape i was hoping that the inner box would protect the item but alas one of the two doors was damaged i'm now trying to get amazon to replace the door but they can only exchange the whole unit the shipping box is completely destroyed so i 've been forced to contact the manufacturer directly crossing my fingers	19
1	this tv monitor rocks ! ! i 've been looking for a combo computer monitor and tv that i could use in my office this lcd does both very well i'm writing this review with the lns4696d installed and everything on the screen is very large \( what i wanted \) even at 1600x1200 and the resolution is far better than i expected ! ! \( hint sharpen the image and set high energy saving mode \)	19
1	also at an awesome price i am going to buy another one just to keep in case the one i have needs to be replaced	19
1	are they the best no do they impress people who havent hear them before yes ! ! to me thats the best compliment they are much more objective listenerswith no preconcived notions all i ever hear is those speakers sound so good i love those cool little speakers etc i 've played everything from bach to dio and they sound very realistic subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level at they are a steal i paid in 1991 and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new	19
1	outstanding product ! keeps the laptop cool plus the added benefit of having 4 usb ports	19
1	i bought this cooling fan because my computer was shutting off on its own and the problem seemed to be that the computer was overheating while this product has n't cured my computer the performance of my computer has definitely improved with the use of the cooling fan the extra usb ports are convenient as well i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a laptop and wants to keep it from overheating	19
1	i am new to this type of device but it has performed as expected	19
1	this is a great radio for sailboats and other boats that do not have a 12v power supply	19
1	i bought this because i needed good phones without the extra bulk they 're really lightweight but not flimsy they have very good sound quality i really like the volume control on the headphones themselves it gives me the extra level of control all in all a really good bang for your buck	19
1	jensen jm10 anonymous review i love these headphones ! ! the easy access volume control is right where i need it and i can turn it on and off whenever i need to they are a great value ! the headphones stay where they are supposed to and fit my head great the sound quality is clear and crisp the single cord attached makes it feel as if your not wearing headphones at all i would recommend it to all my friends	19
1	this card worked out of the box on my linux ubuntu 6 10 based system this belkin card at least the version i have is based on the atheros chip set	19
1	for the price these speakers are well worth the cost of course in my opinion anything that dosnt say creative on it is usually worth the price not a lot of bass but with the bass boost these speakers sound real nice only bad thing i 'll say is that m audio 's tech department is really bad emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista still no answer \( my inquiry was about a different m audio product \)	19
1	note this product will only work on walls with wood studs no metal studs see the sanus website for installation manual and more details	19
1	the carry case does the job of holding my walkman and therefore i say it is worth the money however i have found for my smaller arm it is hard to get it wrapped around in a steady position but with some effort it does overall i am happy with the purchase	19
1	i use this subwoofer to augment my 7 1 system it was easy to install gives excellent response and i could n't be more pleased	19
1	i liked options and text edit i really liked the ability to scan into micsoft word	19
1	this is one of the best products i have spent my money on this speakers 'speak' well and you will be amazed at how well they sound for that kind of size also the buying experience from amazon was excellent i got mine deleivered in about 2 days will recommend product for anyone else	19
1	you can count on every monster cable made it 's worth the extra money over the cheap ones the gauge of the wire is thicker and the ends are made of better material	19
1	i ca n't say enough about the tivoli am fm radio ! it has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well some folks might be hesistant to spend over 100 for a radio trust me it is well worth it my girlfriend 's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years still sounds great	19
1	simple but does what it 's supposed to allows you to connect the audio output of a laptop pc ipod etc to the audio input on your tv	19
1	this product has worked great with my 2wire gateway modem from at t yahoo the real plus has been the usb connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop 's back panel the connection has been good and i set it up in minutes i tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router and not this device i can see 50 networks from all over my neighborhood	19
1	this printer does an excellent job the colors are vivid and the clarity isvery crisp the only negative is you are restricted to the canon paper with end tabs good value for a compact snap shot printer	19
1	switch was simple to install to my existing network just plug and go i used this switch to separate some cpus off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway worked just as planned and was seamless i actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch network speed and response time increased even for those cpus w out a gig nic i like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic highly recommend	19
1	these cases are amazing ! ! i love them ! ! if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy memorex dvd storage cases there the next best thing i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds thanks memorex !	19
1	this is the only type of speaker cable i use to connect my state of the art sound system	19
1	while the two fans i ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly they are not as advertised on amazon 's website according to the specs on the site they have a double ball bearing design which last longer than normal fans be warned these are not the antec double ball bearing fans but the less expensive ones have contacted amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately	19
1	this radar laser detector is very good detects the police radarand the best is do not false signals	19
1	it does everything promised but takes several hours of going over the instructions to figure out how to program some of the features instructions hard to locate in booklet	19
1	i took my mp3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds eveyone i tried was terrible so i ended up buying online i read all the reviews especially amazon reviews because the people know what they are talking about i have bought 5 pair altogether for friends and they love these buds too the music i listen to ranges from tupac to vivaldi and everything in between my mp3 player has 9 eq settings i keep it on new age most of the time the price is right and the sound is the best	19
1	this is a very nice tv for the money great picture and with the built in dvd player that plays cd 's i was able to remove a big old crt tv dvd player and stereo from the bedroom i'm happy with my choice	19
1	i gave this 5 stars only because it serves its purpose well it 's just a basic mouse pad but the price is excellent ! !	19
1	i just love the color the stile and the price it is a perfect player thank you	19
1	for the money i got a good quality product my purchase experience was good and product was received in a timely manner	19
1	i bought this cable half minded reading the other reviews and i was bit worried whether it will work when i hooked up the cable between my laptop and tv wow this is really worth a buy	19
1	we received this item very quickly it was exactly what we ordere	19
1	umm this is ink not much to say other than it works fine with my epson r320 printer	19
1	we looked at many tv stands to go with the sony tv we were buying only a few were worth considering but finally decided to go with the sony unit designed for our specific tv am i glad we did ! it has hold downs to secure the tv and the cable straps at the rear are easy to use and make the installation clean and clear very nicely designed along with being good looking	19
1	great joystick ! i did n't think i could find any better than my sidewinder but i was wrong ! very configurable and smooth	19

1	no problem whatsoever with this product it was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly	19
1	i 've never tried verbatim media since there were 5inch computer floppy disc \( circa 1983 85 \) i pleased to find that verbatim still makes a quality product	19
1	i 've seen others coaster from day 1 and i 've seen others coaster after day 60 \( after an actual succesfull write ! \) but these are absolutely awesome highly reliable long term	19
1	i'm so happy with these speakers for the price the sound is utterly amazing i have a good moderately priced system and these speakers really make it special no one can believe the crystal highs or the big bass coming from such humble looking speakers	19
1	this radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple user friendly set of controls also perfect for those that like analogue style controls that would be encountered on older radios i have the s 350 the model that the s 350dl replaces for general world band programme listening this radio is fantastic outstanding speaker easy to read digital display includes backlight includes attenuator clock can be set to 24 hour time easy to carry anywhere robust antenna does not support ssb tuning which you would need to tune in ham radio same radio sold under tescun name in other parts of the world	19
1	i do n't know what was wrong w the other reviewers machine but let me assure you this is not an inferior product i got it on clearance target for 69 98 i have been looking for a long time for a good portable dvd player i have used it and had no problems with it whatsoever plus if anything does happen in the first 90 it is fully returnable to target good deal all around highly reccomended	19
1	this product is good i have n't seen any issues with this so far	19
1	mouse is comfortable to use and i have n't had any problems with it so far i did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer but once i figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there it is my first wireless mouse so i have nothing else to compare it to but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse	19
1	i needed this cable to use with my garmin rino 120 because my new laptop did n't have a serial adapter my first try was to use a similiar product from radio shack but i found the radio shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable i ordered the cp technologie product from amazon and it worked great ! also the cp tech product was less than half the cost of the radio shack product \( including shipping \)	19
1	i tried many other adapters and this was the only one that worked for my pda	19
1	this wall mount works and hold 's great i used it for an olevia 542i lcd flat panel and have had no problems the instructions are not all that clear but it is not hard to figure out how to instal	19
1	these folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory and amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it 's like money in the bank i hope no one comes in and tries to improve things	19
1	great new product ! easy to use and turns my audio ipod into a portable media player i can even use it to record my favorite tv shows i highly recommend this product	19
1	for this price these are a steal ! purchased mine for 15 \( with shipping \) and let me tell you it was worth it ! the headphones come with a 1 4 converter too ! so you can use them for cd players and amps ! the sound quality is good and the headphones do n't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours these are an amazing deal for the price i'm honestly surprised these ar n't marked for 50 do n't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones	19
1	when i opened my package i was a little disappoined with this product but after using it for a while i learned to like it it is easy to use the front controls with the inno but akward to turn on and off overall a nice case shoped around and found amazon had best price with free shipping received in about one week	19
1	i bought these for some sony surround sound speakers although i was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is \( essentially \) plastic however they turned out to be very sturdy and easy to install i also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware well worth the price	19
1	popped it in works like a charm hardest part is opening the packaging but other than that no worries	19
1	my husband and i bought this for our new home and we 're both thrilled ! he loves that it holds our new tv and stereo system and i love the way it looks it 's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours we 're so glad we found something we could both agree on ! what a great piece of furniture !	19
1	they are good for the price they have a very good sound quality or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player it had a low volume output and then again even on the sony player i had to have the volume at 7 and it only goes to 9 if you have a high output player or a computer these will be great but if your using them for a low output or old device these probably wo n't cut the cheese	19
1	easy to mount on the wall though this item came with hardware with different sizes i still had to buy some hardware with different length than what they supplied this mount perfectly suited for my 46 sony lcd flat panel in about 30 min i could mount tv on this bracket	19
1	seems to be good quality has a strong rubber scent and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though	19
1	i have two ipods that do n't work i bought a shuffle first and that has an error that i ca n't fix and apple ca n't fix so i thought i 'd buy 1gb ipod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer so this time i made the right decision and bought the 30 gb zune wow ! the zune is so much better ! it has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely instead of making you frustrated like the ipod the screen is perfect sound quality is excellent 5 stars for the zune	19
1	i do n't bother charging my zune from the computer any more this is the only way to go	19
1	this compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio all computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down it was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers i will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first	19
1	garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to this option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the gps now if only the software was smart about how and when to use the sensor	19
1	i used this recorder alot i have alot of classes and the playback is good it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you have n't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record the sound quality is good 36h record time which can be broken up to folders the only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low and that goes vice versa as well nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons	19
1	this is about the only mouse i buy have gone through a couple of them in the past few years i just ca n't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out this model is one that i find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using if you want a good reliable comfortable mouse this logitech is a good choice	19
1	this is a great product for those who probably do n't write too much as an engineering student i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable however it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class plus it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally	19
1	this is truly the best wifi you can get on the market right now its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1 most importantly i 've had the best gaming experience ever now i can host games on xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun the linksys wrt330n wireless n gigabit gaming router is well worth its money and a great investment i recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great wifi for whatever reason	19
1	i already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers the speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled the mounts are solid and can be oriented in any direction easily i am about to by three more for my center and two fronts i highly recommend	19
1	i have an explorist 210 and this bracket fits it like a glove good sturdy bracket uni directional with strong suction cups installed over a month ago and still has not come loose from windshield great product for the money \( in my case 30 76 free shipping \) purchased a second one for my other vehicle	19
1	this product is really what i expected it to be it has a very clear display with a high resolution for a 4 inch screen the stereo sound is really good and it has a long lasting battery buttons are easy to use i tried recording from the television and it is also satisfying i had no problem about any divx or xvid video type i really enjoy watching films with cowon a2	19
1	i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing ! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players i love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my tv and watch on a big screen any place i go	19
1	i 've used allot of different adapters but this one is got to be the best ever the linksys wpc54gx4 work with all routers but when you pair it up with the linksys wrt54gx4 router look out my range increased and i'm getting upwards of 250mb of speed setup is also a breeze	19
1	i bought it in feb 2006 never had any problem occasionally it stops working and just restarting both the units \( sender and receiver \) fixes the problem i am so satisfied i am buying another pair	19
1	this has got to be the easiest piece of tech i have ever set up except for charging it took under 5 minutes it works as advertised i use skypein and skypeout my phone bill is now 68 a year instead of 384 i also get voice mail for free with the skypein call quality seems as good as ma bell i was concerned with it being made by netgear as i have had spotty luck with their products i liked this phone so much i just purchase another handset \( it can support up to 4 \) this phone will pay for itself in a few months	19
1	im not a professional keyboard player i bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and guitar pro it suits those needs great its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing the keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard if your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the 100 bucks and get the bigger model	19
1	this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference but to see the beam \( not just the dot at the end of the beam \) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out and if you are wondering no matter how bright your laser is without particles in the air you wont see the beam at concerts where they use the big argon lasers they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of	19
1	this has a nice size screen it only has 3 buttons play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it i was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button i just found this out by trial there was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital this would only last a second or two at first i thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them the volume control is on the side as well as the power button it could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me	19
1	very good product small easy to store well worth the very reasonable price	19
1	great invention to those who do n't want to be attached to an ipod and like an updated version of a juke box easy to use load unfortunately however it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound	19
1	i'm not any expert in the computer world but this product it is very easy to install the range is very strong i'm very hapy with this product ! ! !	19
1	i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises but it works nonetheless and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections but i suspect it 's related to where i have things in the house no so much the product in fact i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine it 's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed ca n't complain especially for the price	19
1	i bought a zen 30g mp3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v moda earbuds came in they are awesome the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon so i feel pretty good about the purchase	19
1	this is a great card for a laptop however they need to correct their problems with the installer for xp also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line once you do get to them they fix the problem right away seems they know it will not install correctly then it works great	19
1	the product description is incorrect usb 2 0 works fine on the newer macs that have such ports it 's overpriced buy a gently used one	19
1	i use this bag to carry my hp nc6000 business notebook i have received many complements on this bag	19
1	i am using this bag for school in which i need to carry 4 textbooks a laptop \( 15 4 inch screen \) and a couple of notebooks the pack has plenty of room for these items and still a couple of empty front pockets for additional gear with all that weight the pack is still comfortable to wear and has yet to bother my back	19
1	these dvds are probably the highest quality and most reliable that i have tried and given their low price what is there not to like \? i would recommend these to just about anyone	19
1	in comparison to the component cables the quality is a little better i do n't think i agree with those who say you must have hdmi cables to get a good picture but i am extremely satisfied with the product and i do n't regret purchasing it amazon 's price for this product is unmatched	19
1	totally agree with the other reviewers' comments originally i was going to buy canon 's adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic ! ! plus even with shipping this is still cheaper \( by 5 bucks \) and its metal ! fyi if you do n't have any filters \( like i did n't \) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm \( circular polarizer uv protector and 812 warming len \) a good buy for the price i bought it because of the reviewers' comments and do n't regret it	19
1	it costs 30 40 less than the canon la dc58f conversion lens adapter and it 's metal not plastic need to say more	19
1	i purchased 4 of these adapters \( 3 extra \) so i could hook up my macbook 's digital output for digital surround sound through my logitech speakers the product works exactly as i expected great digital sound from my macbook parts express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than i expected \( ordered on a saturday and they had the package to the courier by saturday night \) very prompt service i would definitely order from them again overall a great product from a prompt company !	19
1	excellant product excellant price hope to do business again ty for fast speedy shipment a pleasure doing business with you	19
1	this really works i have 3 zp100 's and 1 zp80 using a nas for storage of my mp3 's the whole thing hangs together perfectly if you want to get music through your whole house this is a great way to do it most importantly tech support is great ! ! !	19
1	wow ! i did n't trust the other review i needed a mini amp so i decided to bought this one because of the price and of the dual purpose right out of the box it actually smell bacon ! ! amazing it was true ! and not only that if someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp and do n't want to stop this is the mini amp for you ca n't believe the speaker in it and about the disto well is ok for practice wo n't regret about it	19
1	i have had this items before in fact this is a replacement for one that was mounted on my motor home the windshield had to be replaced and a new antenna was needed works fine just like the one before a very eash purchase and fast delivery	19
1	i 've been using this nas for a month and it 's great ! the box is quite speedy with a maxtor ata 133 drive with a 16mb cache i have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files very slick ! i ca n't get the built in ftp server to work through my firewall but i think that 's a ports issue all in all a great box	19
1	i wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports i bought two and both worked fine right out of the box not the fastest card ever but certainly large storage for the price	19
1	when i bought these i was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my mp3 player in my pocket not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound i did n't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product the cord also has a built in volume control so i do n't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume the buds are quite comfortable i have worn them for hours at a time with no problem i love these	19
1	i just purchased a mogo mouse and i'm amazed at how usable it is i was extremely skeptical \( and probably would n't have bought one \) until i was able to try a colleague 's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is the one thing and it 's a pretty big thing is the lack of scroll wheel technology that 's a sorely missed feature in this mouse that said there are always trade offs but in this case that 's the only one battery life seems great usability is great convenience is great just add the touch pad and it 'll be the mouse for notebook computer users !	19
1	when you look at the price it may seem pricey but when you get the product there is some serious engineering involved the web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason i bought an ergotron the attention to detail is incredible mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two person job other than that the installation was flawless this is a very solid and well machined kudos to ergotron \( also these guys are serious about ergonomics 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations \) wonderful product 5 stars shipping from amazon was slow and behind schedule	19
1	i am an it director and bought these for exercisers for my users the outside is like a balloon only much stronger rubber and the inside is gel when you squeeze them the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color it 's cool ! the resistance is very good and my users love them ! good product great value and excellent quality	19
1	when you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate it really seems to run out of one color much quicker than the others personally its usually red it has caught me with my pants down a couple times going to print out a project the night before its due only to run out of red or blue ink i would definetly suggest to always have an extra one around just in case	19
1	i use only the best products not refills or other manufactures as i have had problems with print cartridges that have ruined my printers the hp ink jet cartridges are the best i will always buy them	19
1	this is a great case i have had no problems with it and works very well it 's also very sexy if you want to put it that way and looks really cool only trouble i have is that when i open it sometimes it 'll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch but its very minor and does no damage it 's a great item ! however if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot i 'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc just protect it from scratches and smudges i recommend it highly	19
1	this card works exactly as stated by startech i bought two one for a pc and one for a mac popped 'em in and plugged in ipods external hardrives a scanner and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly the pc needed a quick setup and the mac worked instantly ! and all at a great price ! ca n't figger out why you guys are having trouble	19
1	bought this player for its size \( sports \) and its napster compatibility updated the firmware after having a rocky start but things seem a little more stable now also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods \( around 0 degrees celsius \) odd behaviour but mostly ok now that we are in the spring teens again have n't found a case yet to protect from sweat interface is what i expected dead simple no complaints for the price	19
1	excellent machine great performancesaved lot of time and desk space great scanning speed and qualit	19
1	i have had other apc battery backup 's in the past and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit given our power failures brown out and the high wind and storms in our area the apc does an excellent job i have not only my desktop pc but my scanner printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures	19
1	there are over 100 reviews i am not saying the same thing again i just throw my rating in all i can say is you will be better off if you completely learn how to master this calculator	19
1	i have been using this mouse at work since it came out after many miles of use the scroll wheel has finally started to fail i can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls the best feature of this mouse is the battery life a coworker who swears by his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months but i usually got at least ten months out of mine i even took to dating the batteries when i installed them just to rub it in this mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some but overall i would recommend it going to try a rechargable logitech next time around	19
1	i do n't know where the guy below got that this card does n't work with windows media center edition because i just installed the latest xp drivers for the card on media center edition 2005 and it works perfectly i sold my gigaport ag to get this because of the much better signal noise ratio that the firewire audiophile has and it made a big difference very clean sound ! i use it to dj with using mixvibes using the asio drivers and it works beautifully ! a great buy to say the least pick one up you wont regret it	19
1	we purchased this tv in dec of 2006 we are very happy with it it was very easy to plug and play had it ready in no time for holiday i would definitely recommed it to new buyers	19
1	it was easy ordering easy delivery and satisfying outcome love the tv	19
1	have only used it a couple of times in a month and feel like i 've already justified the low cost should be fine for my intermittent use	19
1	right price and works off of usb ! the sound is terrible on macbook so this will fill in nicely	19
1	i bought this cute little speaker from walmart \( 14 \) and it is so compact and very useful it also matches with my other speakers of sony dream system this has 4 usb ports \( so good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pc sitiing down the table \) they are lighted so that you can plug them in even night speaker is good quality and it has one usb connection and one dc connection quality of sound is good if not excellent overall it is a great buy for the price	19
1	works as advertised i needed longer range and it provided easy setup stable connection	19
1	fast service and great price ! work great for about a mile or so but then i got them for shopping with my wife she is at one end of the store and i am at the other	19
1	sent quickly and nicely packaged these will do the job for those desiring a shorter recording program	19
1	this is my first experience with hdtv and wide screen this 46 sony tv is excellent with hd programs with regular broadcasts it is a bit muddy but that is the fault of the signal not the tv i am very pleased with the overall quality of the set i had the set professionally installed and set up and i am sure glad i did install and set up are not for amateurs like me if anything ever happens i will be hard pressed to reset things sony 's instruction manuals are not that great	19
1	my panasonic rv31k is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when i first took it out of the box panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon if this player ever dies \( cross my fingers \) i will get another panasonic i choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions co	19
1	the stick came in an excellent condition and works perfectly i recommend this product	19
1	elegant design sturdy construction supports my yamaha sy35 securely after reading the forbidding reviews i decided to assemble it without first reading the directions it took me 10 min	19
1	i'm very happy with this device the suction cup holds very securly i would advise anyone who buys a satellite receiver to skip the adhesive mounting bracket that comes with it it will come un stuck eventually just get one of these brackets and mount the radio right in the first place	19
1	if you like to listen to audio tapes you will like this one replacing the provided headphones is a good idea fm reception a little weak but the tape play time on one aa battery is amazing lightweight and good quality for the price	19
1	by far this is the best printer i 've had i been buying epson for many years if you like your pictures to have that pro photo look this the printer to own the price is great delivery was very quick rec 'd it next day when you buy epson you wo n't back	19
1	came quickly and was exactly as offered i am completly satisfie	19
1	i mean seriously i'm running a ubuntu box here with other card type things sometimes i 'd have to modify or find drivers and wrappers for some stuff to work not with this i just slid it into the computer and wa bam makes my dvd player a bajillion times faster than it was before and just worked out of the box	19
1	i just purchased the archos 604 about 3weeks ago so far so good it interfaces very easily with the computer though i have not tried it using windows media 10 yet i recommend at least buying the archos docking adapter kit \( if you do not plan on using the archos to record programs \) it allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos the only negative that i have so far is that the volume at its highlest level is difficult to hear on an airplane you may need some noise canceling headphones	19
1	i ordered this for my teenage daughter for christmas and she loves it the sound is great and the amplifier works well for the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument i recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar	19
1	i received a pleasent surprise the keyboard was shipped sooner than i expected arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully i will buy from this vendor again	19
1	it does work live with dsl installed on the same line ever heard of dsl filters \? too small \? are you kidding \? this phone is great all around	19
1	the price i paid for this spindle of cd r 's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet the only price that i have seen that beats this one was staples running a sale of 50 for 10 but i have yet to use the stock that i bought as i still have about 25 left on the spindle if you do n't want to wait for their sale this is an excellent bargain the print surface has done very well with the inks from my epson photo r 220	19
1	the case is nice but i bought it thinking it would hold my folding keyboard it was too small the price was great and the transaction was flawless	19
1	compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special cf 's with extended bases other than that it ca n't be beat for the price and quality adorama rocks	19
1	i enjoyed putting this together the spacers kinda threw me until i realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf i got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the dvd shelves were n't spaced properly cd sized so i had to take it apart and redo it but that was n't too bad the spacers snap apart easily enough even for my feeble fingers it 's not terribly sturdy maybe i did n't get the poles screwed down tightly enough but as long as it 's in its permanent location holds the multimedia well i really like the way it looks bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one too	19
1	the amd ahtlon 64 venice processor is great installed into my new gigabyte mb without a hitch and runs very cool that will give up some room for future overclocking overall i would highly recommend the processor by applying for their credit card i received a really low price from amazon which was very surprising about 170 00 with free shipping and no tax everyone else was 200 230 for the same processor it is a great cpu at a good price from amazon	19
1	this card is one of the best the graphics are very high ! i play games at full specs needs a big chassis because generates heat i did bought a tt armor and my system works better easy installation	19
1	not a bad product but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well no matter where the antenna is positione	19
1	i have been using a lot mouses during last years but this is the best far away from the others it 's very comfortable to use it	19
1	i compared it with low cost monoprice and high cost monster cable i picked up 10' cable for about 70 00 from amazon few months ago it 's been working pretty well no complains so far and i like the thinness of cable	19
1	this 23 lcd hdtv has excellent image quality and looks really stylish too it also comes with hdmi so you can hook up the latest hd video source such as hd dvd or blue ray hi def dvd players the lcd panel itself displays vivid evenly lit images and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model i personally ended up opting for the sharp ld 23sh1u hdtv lcd monitor because the sharp works as pc mac monitor \( plus j r started offering a rebate \) but i think this panasonic is a great choice too no doubt about that	19
1	i purchased this so my pc could share a monitor with my xbox360 does the job at a cheap cost ! so easy to use that my 4 yr old can use it	19
1	this is just great lots of storage for data files and pictures allows me to keep my file with me where ever i go no additonal software required just plug it in the usb port and you have instant files fast and easy to use small in size but big in storage i give it 5 stars	19
1	code length of this product is very small i had to buy an extention cord the sound quality is not bad	19
1	turns out i do n't like in ear ear phones the sound on these is good though the bass is a bit much in my opinion the in ear style makes me feel deaf to the outside world if you do like this style these are pretty good	19
1	these are the only reliable disks i have found i began a collection of friends on my dvd rws i have over 25 disks full so far and only had minimal problems with 1 or 2 disks i rewatch all my favorite episodes of which i have over 100 and have no problems these are the best	19
1	with over 3 hours recording time these are great i use them for meetings no problems or errors	19
1	this is a great printer for those who want to print on 12x12 scrapbook pages it works well with heavier \( cardstock \) paper it also prints great photos i have a mac i book i also use the print shop 2 program with it it gives me great versatility with my pages photos	19
1	my criteria for my new printer purchase was 1 11x172 individual inks3 reliable printer company4 easy installation good customer service5 price \( this was a bit pricey but the next step up was not a choice \) so far for my needs this has been a great printer so far it does great quality prints for photos school projects and more i wanted to have more versatility to make posters labels photos etc my last hp wide format printer \( 1200c \) lasted for over 5 years and i took it everywhere i have only had this for a few motnhs but it has n't been a disappointment yet	19

1	its a great graphics card especially for the price i got it to improve roller coaster tycoon 3 and it did but the controls arent as clear as they could be for the anti aliasing settings and the anisotropic filtering	19
1	so far so good ! only takes up 1u in our rack this product arrived in good shape and on time setup was a breeze right now we only have 2 servers connected to it but switching between them is no problem so i do n't foresee a problem when we add 4 more kevi	19
1	i hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the ipod and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches thanks for a fantastic product	19
1	i ca n't remember when i felt so good about an online purchase the product is more than i expected for the money and the quick service just awed me ! i will definately be doing business through amazon many many more times in the future ! thank you	19
1	use original epson brand ink the heads in the epson printers it 's in the printer itself not in the ink cartridge it dosent worth saving some dollars and ruing the printer	19
1	i bought this printer to print my shipping labels faster it 's easy to use ! it prints very fast print quality is excellent changing diferent type of labels is easy too i highly recommend this printer	19
1	everything about the sonos worked as advertised it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated the interface is commonsense and well thought out it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously you can also play different music all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises	19
1	the xmb 10 is a great way to listen to my xm audiovox receiver at home the boombox is slightly larger than i desired but the sound is great it 's easy to use lightweight very portable and nice looking	19
1	i got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it the unit is beautifully designed fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small my only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong i live in a tough area for reception and there 's slight static on my favorite stations the fm antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit but the reception is still not totally clear that being said i'm glad i got it and when my wife 's happy i'm happy	19
1	this is an excellent power conditioner and voltage stabilizer all in one this unit can protect your sensitive high end audio system computers and video moniters from everyday power surges power sags over voltages and brown outs these surges pick away at your sensitive equipment taking years off their useful life i own and highly recommend this unit	19
1	i 've had hp and lexmark printers in the past this canon outshines both of the other brands it is super easy to install without any troubleshooting works like a charm the prints looks great	19
1	amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones the different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear when i first got them i put the smallest buds on first and thought i had just bought the worst headphones so i tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold and just let you know i ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just do n't fit righ	19
1	i reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as i have n't authored or copied very many dvds with it yet however what i have accomplished with it is commendable i can copy an entire commercial dvd \( movie all the extras \) under 50 minutes i have composed a slide show dvd with my own mp3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it so far no coasters i am now in the process of producing dvds of my old 8mm home movies the converter is giving me more problems than anything still recommend the px 755uf for anyone interested in an external burner installation was a snap \( plug n play \)	19
1	these fit over everything very well and they stayed put without stretching out which is why my original pads fell off i guess it 's one of those products that you ca n't do much better than 10 for but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something	19
1	got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable do n't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty	19
1	i used these speakers \( 4 \) as part of my 7 1 channel theater and i used the hti 55 center channel plus the hti 8 ceiling to finish off my system i have a denon 2307ci pumping these speakers and let me tell you i ca n't even crank up the system to the highest as these speakers rock my entire house from the basement ! ! ! these are the best in wall speakers i have ever bought ! ! ! ! buy them now before they 're all gone ! highly recommend	19
1	the chip works just as advertised i have had no problems with it it was easily formatted to my kodak camera and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video great product i would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price	19
1	works great had to remove the brown plastic fitting from the antenna wire that encased the actual metal connector to the cradle other reviews pointed this out so it was n't a big deal just had to be done carefully	19
1	everything works great the only marginal issue is that the batteries do n't last a full eight hours it works in the car but cuts in and out guess i have to break down and buy the car kit	19
1	my dad and i installed it in just an hour ! it was very you ca n't beat this price i found the same mount at best buy for over 200 ! ! !	19
1	great soundcard ! i noticed in battlefield 2142 that i can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better i'm not getting knifed as often \( which is a very good thing ! \) i'm glad i got this card	19
1	this is a great little power strip that allows me to maximize the contents of my briefcase one of the most useful things i have ever bought for business travelling very well made i would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive	19
1	very solid nice looking shelf easy to assemble with good instructions and all required pieces included it 's exactly as i expected it	19
1	i have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now and the quality of the sound is excellent particularly given the reasonable price i'm sure you can get better performance but it will cost much more these speakers are a rare find in today 's business world something that is actually a good deal	19
1	i struggled between this and the shure e2c i decided on the e2c after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3 this one has the least clarity but wonderful bass if i do n't listen to as much classical music i 'd definitely pick vmoda vibe it makes even terrible pop songs sound cool i had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason and i had an extremely hard time putting it in even with the help of my bf the vmoda did not come with any foam only the silicon ear pieces i settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c	19
1	this is by far the best radio i 've ever had for singing in the shower no more fumbling and messing with the dial while i 've got soap in my eyes 10 fm presets 5 am presets and 5 tv presets weather i'm always able to find something good to listen to it works great for when i'm out in the yard doing some work as well	19
1	the maps are good enough for navigation of streets and outdoor adventures it allows downloading tracks and waypoints from the gps editing them and saving to files or the gps it is annoying to have to put the last cd in your drive to use the program	19
1	i recently purchased the item and knew that some assembly was required i did n't know that i would be soldering components onto a printed circuit board that 's ok i was an electronic technician in a former life but it might pose a problem to who might purchase this item expecting a snap together kit	19
1	i 've had these earphones for about two month and i 've discovered the following i like the look and they seem to be well made the only grip i have is that they are not very loud	19
1	i love the sound quality and the way i am able to exercise and not notice that i have headphones on the headphones do n't slide but i have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit overall well worth the money	19
1	great product but is only 30 at iriver com 's stor	19
1	there is not a lot to this device simply plug the wire that comes with it into your yamaha amplifier and receiver and away you go the ipod gets charged and on my receiver i can even select the song to play via the on screen gui on the tv	19
1	it is very small and looks very cool you can charge it very fast ts sound is very good too t has radio function too	19
1	i purchased the transmitter because i do n't have an aux input in my car the product works well i live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio one review mentioned the sansa player wo n't fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on i use the silicon case to protect my player i took off the belt clip that comes with the case the player and case fits well enough in the transmitter	19
1	i 've used everything from ableton live to protools to reason and this thing is just plug and play very easy interface makes for no brainer recording i'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it 's all about the song the sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles fantastic product guys and for the money it 's a steal	19
1	this is just great for a single vpu video card the cooling system works great moving all the hot air outside the cpu the software overclock is good too u can change values any time u want and u can select if u want those applied for 3d games only it works with any game i 've tested it with oblivion at 1280x1024 hdr enabled and every option at maximum it works great with f e a r at 1280x1024 with aax8 and ffa x 4the price is good for a very high end video cards	19
1	i have purchased over two dozen of these units this is the best unit for the price there are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit this allows you to be certain that your feed is being input also the card slots are a plus two things to be aware of if you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in also if you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required not a one disc does all unit	19
1	works as billed i am currently playing a dvd rl that would not play on any other player i have not purchased a 1080p lcd tv but it is why i purchased an upconverting dvd player i have tried dvd r and dvd rw i will be trying audio formats later i would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the hd versus blueray to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down	19
1	they are great for putting dvd 's cd 's in they arrive in great condition	19
1	i'm not a serious piano player just casual do n't have room for a piano so this serves my purposes i just want to entertain myself if i were a professional who played in public not sure if this would be the ultimate keyboard because it does n't have a fullsize keyboard but for practicing and casual playing it 's great ! it has more features than i will ever use	19
1	this is exactly what i was looking for not too expensive not much hassle with the cables they are integrated with the unit and no need to reach for the button to switch computers simply press scroll lock twice to go from one computer to the other cables are pretty long which is good longer that i need at the moment but i may appreciate the extra length in the future	19
1	a great and economical replacement ! this product saved me a lot of money the red in the color leaked a tiny bit in shipment but cleaned up and worked with no problem	19
1	it works very well it 's nice to be able to listen to cd 's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed my only problem is that the cd player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent this happens rarely but it 's enough to be a little annoying other than that it 's a very nice product no skipping easy to use and a fair price	19
1	i got this product when i first signed up to telewest broadband and it has never failed i have had it for 2 years and not a problem i started at 512kbps and they 've upgraded me to 4mbps and it handles that speed without a problem perfect for your light moderate or heavy user good all rounder thanks for reading	19
1	this product has good and bad points i listed some below good cheaper than apple \( 5 as compared to 30 \) works greatsmallconvienientbad cheap \( might not hold up long term \) no warranty coverage for your ipod is something goes wronghas to be plugged in upside down \( for me anyway \) overall i'm glad i bought this instead of apple 's version the main factor for me was price but if you have the money get the apple charger simply because you 'll be covered by warranty that way	19
1	just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from western digitals website you should have no problems very nice	19
1	i love this remote i was afraid that having a non tivo brand unit \( toshiba brand tivo unit \) would require lots of setup \( testing dozens of codes before finding the right one \) mine worked just as soon as i put batteries into the unit the buttons are quite intuitive i never used the user 's manual yet a real winner an inexpensive replacement for the real unit	19
1	we installed this external hd on a dell computer as most dell customers will attest to any time you talk to one of their representatives they 'll deny compatability with anything other than a dell product well i have upgraded the video card power supply and now added this hd to the computer with very liitle effort this hd has performed perfectly for us	19
1	i bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me ! so far it does what it 's suppose to do i am pleased it 's a little clunky and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended we 'll see how it works in 6 months	19
1	this is a great drive for your money if you use mac windows and linux i use all of them and it works great i do wish that they had an 8 gig versions out but this one will do for now	19
1	i am kind of a shortwave junkie and have a few radios all over the place i must admit that for the money spent and the performance and endurance this little bugger is probably my best buy ! i cannot believe the sound quality or the reception its phenominal ! i can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where i work ! \( big heavy steel freezers \) it is a simple small no frills pocket size radio but it blows away anything in its price range trust me	19
1	same hp burner player that is 30 or more in the local stores installation was fast and easy nero software installed fast very little info on the nero products to play dvd you need to install the cyber dvd player on the nero disk	19
1	i love this product the earbuds were even better than i had expected i wanted something small that would n't hurt my ears and i wanted a long cord and that is just what i got i am very happy with the product and the service thank yo	19
1	i travel overseas a lot for my job this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your normal plugs for operating four devices most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money \( wires cables etc \) but this gizmo rocks	19
1	i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity it worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which would n't fit in the normal outlet at the same time it 's small rugged and light so it 's easy to pack	19
1	having a bad view of the southern sky i needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio it maded all the difference great product and it came with 30 ft of cable	19
1	a very good product but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself howard rules !	19
1	i 've owned this item for almost a full year and i am extremely pleased with it it 's so nice being able to carry around my laptop and my books in the same bag the side pockets are kind of useless for them being so small but i guess i 'll be able to find a purpose for them	19
1	ordered directly from hp fast delivery solid package no dead pixel works perfec	19
1	i muchly recommend suggest buying purchasing these batteries power sources in the pre tried used section you can save pay less for them these that way but be warned aware used pre tried batteries is may be no good since they is not may be rechargedable	19
1	all electronics should work this easily you hook it up read the manual play with it alittle bit and it works like a charm i 've been using two \( home desk and car player \) for 5 years now they just seem to last forever	19
1	this watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use whenever i need to remember to check the dryer or the stove all i have to do is push one button to the number of minutes i want to wait its the only watch i wear and i never take it off i even swim with it on the only reason i did n't give it five stars is because it is so plain i wish casio would make it in a pretty color	19
1	great product that works exactly as described i have not used this as a stand alone label maker i 've only used it with my computer the software is fairly easy to use and it will pull data from an excel spreadsheet which is a definite plus i had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which i needed to make labels and linking to the excel doc made the process very quick and convenient the only complaint i have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey i spent 40 on the label maker and so far i 've spent 60 on tape	19
1	the lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease product is easy to use and understand for the money a great purchase	19
1	i purchased this as a gift for my 56 year old mother who simply ca n't get enough scrabble with her friends while i did not get the opportunity to use the product myself she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat	19
1	i have multiple cameras and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time if you have a sd card and a cf card both can be inserted and read written to without having to switch out the cards very nice reader for a great price the blue led is very pleasant to look at	19
1	this card is significantly cheaper \( at the time i ordered \) than the sandisk extreme iii at the same speed \( 133x \) i was expecting to receive a 100x since it was listed as that in the description but the 133x came and i was very happy works as advertised and kingston is a reliable memory brand product came quickly	19
1	outstanding cleaner for your cd or cdrw mp3 player takes you through many diagnostic tests even has a dolby test well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it i used it on both my pc cd and cdrw drives as well as my stereo cd player fantastic product ! !	19
1	i'm so technically challenged and i had no trouble figuring out this system i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it altogether they were a bit pricey but worth every penny ! very easy to understand the directions and lots of bells and whistles lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description i love the intercom features they are great for when the kids are upstairs i do n't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them very cool	19
1	i could n't believe how lightweight this monitor is and how easy it was to connect to my computer it is one of the best investments i have made this year what a difference the lcd screen makes for my vision its wonderful i highly recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for something easy to connect and have excellent quality as well it is the perfect monitor for me	19
1	this watch is not only the best watch i have ever owned it is the only day time watch that i ever use i love the 1 3 5 10 20 30 minute timer found only on this watch i love it so much that i buy several and change out the band to match different outfits ! i do wish that this watch came in a more dressy version i also hope that casio continues to make this watch for people who need a timer and a dependable alarm	19
1	i 've had this printer for four years i print approximately 25 documents each week this is the first time that i have had to replace the cartridge it 's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time too compared to ink jet printers that i have had i get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets great buy	19
1	i 've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems a ge set and a 2 4 gig uniden set this is by far the best actually it 's perfect no noise on the line at all everything just works perfectly only one caution this particular model does not have an answering machine i was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did if you want an answering machine to come with make sure you buy the right model i'm totally sold on the dect 6 0 ! ! ! ! buy it you wo n't regret it	19

1	i recently bought and installed this radio in my truck and i have not had any problems yet ! ! ! a few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive \( sometimes when it is on i do not receive any traffic \) but that is about it i enjoy cobra products this is my second radio \( i just traded up from a 25nwxt \) i have a cobra hg2000 antenna and i am waiting on a cobra mic for my radio so far no problems with any of it and i hope to have none down the road ! ! ! !	19
1	i 've had my cobra 29 for over five years now it 's been in four different trucks and traveled over 500 000 miles with me once i added two wilson antennas and a power mic i can get out over four miles on a good night my personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside i love it i was thinking of getting a galaxy but why \? i have a great radio here	19
1	after doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model i decided to purchase this shredder so far it was a wise decision i have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money i have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome i put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag and i can just keep reusing the same bag it really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working no jams etc great buy !	19
1	there is just one word to describe this product amazing i'm full satisfied with it just buy it with 1mbytes \( mine is 512kbytes \) one last thing the battery lasts forever	19
1	fantastic sound for the money ! \( seems to work well with asus p5w dh anyway \) nice crisp highs decent mid range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick imo the only down side i could find is some of the nonsense software included is well nonsense creative scores again	19
1	buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again used to have one years ago now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer	19
1	i use this scanner primarily for text documents and could n't be more impressed you do need text software i have textbridge but i find relatively few errors in the scan proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient best of all i do n't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk caution i have n't used it for photos but it does a great job on text	19
1	this mouse has never let me down really works on most of the surfaces	19
0	sometimes it sprays when she barks most of the time it does n't so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low it 's not the battery or the fill level maybe it just depends on the dog i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine \( my children found this amusing	20
0	light is beautiful and functional and so great for traveling but first led light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months too bad	20
0	not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs but the company also refused to provide a refund replacement after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing after sitting out in a rainstorm the super bark stop shorted out and is now totally worthless find another product you 'll thank me later	20
0	clock is smaller than i thought and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall made of cheap materials definitely not worth 25	20
0	i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell i have 3 dogs i put it on and they went beserk they started going after each other i did n't hear anything myself but i am quite sure the dogs did like i said they acted very badly towards each other the tone must have made them lash out like that i cannot use it anymore	20
0	my beagle \( 13 mo \) cocks her head showing that she hears something with a slight pause in the barking process but does not deter her from barking at a later time does nothing for howling and will only go off for loud barks not smaller barking or any form of whining \( even if extremely loud \)	20
0	i purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old 's room he has a 19 inch tv vcr dvd combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a 20 inch tv if you have a modern tv with speakers on the side it will not fit ! ! ! ! ! i purchased the item directly from step2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item ! ! ! !	20
0	the neighbor has a yapping mutt that barks night and day since the police wo n't do anything about it i bought this bark free hahaha what a joke the darn dog barked more anyway it did zero for my problem and i consider it a waste of money	20
0	the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly does n't ! this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt what a useless thing i'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor this thing certainly does n't do it ! if you 're looking to buy this thing look again there must be something better if not just your regular broom	20
0	the flip it vacuum was a great idea but little did i know thati would actually have to put my hand in the bin to pull out the dirt and grime after using the wet mop when using the wet mop it will leave water lines where i stop therefore i have to wipe up the floor with paper towels when using the vacuum myliquid cleaner drips onto my hardwood floor leaving water marks ! i have not recommended this product to anyone a waste of 100 00	20
0	bought a global knife a few years ago then bought the water ceramic sharpening device cannot keep this knife sharp it sits in my block with a bunch of cheap 4 star henckels i use the cheap sabatiers \( 9 for the set and the block \) anway it 's no worse than any of my other dull knives just cost mor	20
0	not a good light the light is already fading and i do n't use it very often very disappointed	20
0	if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment this is n't for you the radio is hard to use since it does n't have any indication of what frequency you are on and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static the pedometer function is marginal at best but its what you would expect for 15	20
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working	20
0	i bought this set thinking is was going to look nice for a while due to the name brand and the price wrong this pots get scratches from anything that goes near them after a few months of gentle use they already have so many scratches on the outside and look awful also the handles get really hot	20
0	this item did not work when i got it i returned it to zelco who informed me that it was my error they did not do refunds and returned it to me i had a previous model zelco that worked great for 10 15 years it had a switch this new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off gr	20
0	light is beautiful and functional and so great for traveling but first led light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months too bad	20
0	this item is cheaply made and i sent it back the picture looks cool but it 's deceiving the minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left it plopped down to the left it could n't keep the right time	20
0	i have ordered this unit twice this past month the first one did not work properly in one of the units the signal was distorted after returning it to the supplier i ordered it again from another amazon supplier and one of the units did not work at all i will now look for another brand	20
0	the unit did not recieve or transmit half the distance that was reported across a flat surface 100ft would be pushing it	20

0	the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use i would get the furminator instead it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes ! this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove	20
0	i bought this for my mother in law at her request she has arthritis and saw it on tv she also wanted the free gripper that came with it i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper even paid a little more for it she used the can opener once and it broke the free gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s h fee	20
0	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working	20
0	received this as a gift and i must say i'm very disappointed at its highest setting it takes forever to toast the other issue is that if you buy any bread with non standard width \( like home made gourmet breads \) it wo n't fit into the toaster	20
0	this toaster is more a decoration than anything else my kids eat a lot of bagels frozen waffles and this machine just does n't do the job without multiple toasting cycles even regular bread comes out barely toasted on one cycle i also had the plastic prongs that hold the crumb tray in place break off \( how \? \? it just sits on the counter no one is playing football with it ! \) i feel that i wasted 50 00 on this save your money	20
0	more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc	20
0	i wanted to buy something that would remove the taste of chlorine from the kitchen faucet but even with the brita it still tasted like chlorine after about 2 weeks it started to drip from the where the brita screws into the faucet so now you do n't have filtered water my husband replaced washer and it still dripped if you accidently put the hot water on while someone in the house just before used the filtered part the filter is ruined	20
0	we bought this model because it had the different grind capabilities it quit working after 1 year we also bought one for my mom and her 's quit much sooner	20
0	sent it back could n't see the read out with a plate or saucer on the scale needs a tilted or canted face	20
0	the scale does not come with a battery even though there is a distinct place for it in the internal packaging scale had a 2002 manufacture date on it all of this i can live with the bigger problem was that the scale would not zero itself when turned on it would drift dramatically after a couple of seconds i timed it 40g for one minute \( and after hours just keep on going \) the box had no signs of damage so i'm guessing the load cell was bad very disappointing	20
0	i have had this scale for about 4 months it worked fine the few times i used it but last night i went to use it and it has given up the ghost i swapped batteries and still nothing the connection for the 9v battery is very loose and even after crimping and holding it tight it did n't get any juice not happy so i will order a different brand and hope it does better i do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets so maybe i just got a lemon	20
0	this is a 30 ice crusher whose instructions advise inserting just one cube at a time even at that ludicrous rate the machine occasionally jammed i threw it out went to target and bought a 20 waring blender that has an ice chopping mode it works beautifully even with a dozen cubes at once	20
0	i purchased this opener 12 6 06 and the motor quit 3 5 07 what really troubles me is that i probably only open five or six cans a week please do n't waste your money	20
0	i saw an ad for rabbit comparing it to reidel it is no reidel heavier than i expected and larger than i expected	20
0	i really like the look of this bread bin but the manufacturer does not package it in a box it only has a clear plastic bag around it even though amazon uses it 's own box for shipping it arrived with dents and cracks amazon quickly replaced it with another one which had dents cracks and the entire bottom was was badly scratched i do n't have time to keep sending these back hoping to get a replacement which is n't damaged so i gave up after returning the second one	20
0	the legs were a bit tricky to put down and when i did i busted the mounts never even used this thing threw it away coleman makes one that i bought that 's better built and excalibur electronics has one available as well that i also bought i like excalibur 's better but both are better than this piece of junk all 3 brands are in the same price range interestingly there are n't a lot of portable ac dc fan options out there i bought these for camping in florida	20
0	the electric skillet takes forever to heat up and it does not heat in the corners also it takes longer to cook than an electric frying pan i would not recommend this product thank yo	20
0	the writeup is incorrect this does not fit all cuisinart 12 cup coffee makers it definitely does not fit the dcc 1200 while returning it is not difficult through amazon it means a trip to ups and another 2 weeks of waiting for a correct replacement	20
0	i have two cats both less than 5 months old i bought citikitty training kit hoping it would save me from scooping the litter box it turned out a piece of flimsy junk that 's way over priced my cats would rather do their business anywhere but on this piece of plastic save your money and use it on something more useful	20
0	the heater that i received was defective i down loaded a return label from amazon com and returned the heater i received my refund very quickly i have two other delonghi heaters of a different model that i am very happy with but are no longer manufactured this was my first experiance with this particular model	20
0	if you are looking for a plastic box that rotates then look no further if you are looking for a space heater keep looking	20
0	i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i 'd kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them are n't great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they 're pretty but not very functional	20
0	mazon i ordered 4 for xmas dinner was sent three and they cancelled the 4th one saying the will never get it in thanks amazon	20
0	i purchased this book because i have a lot of bundt pans i was disappointed to see almost half the recipes involved a box cake i buy cook books to make things home made not via boxed cake mixes it basicially told you to buy a box of cake mix and add this and that to it who ca n't do that themselves \? not a good cookbook at all if you want lessons on how to make boxed cakes than you 'll like this box i make all my cakes homemade so this book was useless to me	20
0	i did not buy the whole set my review is for an 8 fry pan it was one of those try it deals i do not like the grooves in the pan because after for instance frying an egg the grooves retain food and if you do n't use a brush to scrub the grooves you 'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves i ca n't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware yikes	20
0	i was very excited with such a inexpensive purchase for high count sheets but very soon i learned it was not such a great deal beware if using them on an older mattress which is not thick ! after putting on the fitted sheet it looked like a huge skin on a baby elephant ! loose material everywhere my real complaint is the pills which appeared only a few days into use they snag on rings watch bracelets etc i would never purchase this material again	20
0	while this vacuum is easy to use it loses suction after only 6 months do n't buy this to waste money	20
0	i loved this vacuum initially you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint you ahve to empty the filter every 5 10 minutes i do not have a terribly messy household just one with no stairs going to the front backyard	20
0	streaks and scratched the front of my dishwasher does a very poor job	20
0	i returned them beacause they are nothing like the good old revereware made in the u s a they are very thin and cheap i do not recommend anyone buying them you willonly want to return them	20
0	i ca n't believe i spent good money on this vacuum i 've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems why it wo n't vacuum without pushing it with all my might why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children why the filter wo n't stay in place and why it smells like burned rubber every time am forced to use it i have replaced every filter and belt now i am going to throw it away i 'd gladly give it to charity but i ca n't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim	20
0	beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop although microfiber mops are relatively new major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs in order to standout from all the competition five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews fortunately the reviews were fabricated about a month ago so hopefully not too many customers have been deceived my experience has been that most reviewers give helpful honest reviews	20
0	the space between the strands is much greater than shown in the picture the cutrain will not hide what is behind it	20
0	i'm glad some of you received these dishes not broken in a million pieces ! amazon or whoever is packaging these needs to learn how to properly pack there was no bubble wrap or popcorn at all just flimsy sheets of cardboard ! ! duh \? \? i 've sent them back twice now and third time wo n't be a charm for me 'cause i wo n't go through this again never will i ever order breakables from amazon again the headache was not worth it even if the dishes are nice and pretty	20
0	this item is not nine inches wide it is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan but costs ten dollars more so you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size hopefully the item description will be changed soon now i have to pack up and ship back several of these but at least amazon is paying the freight lodge logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though i think this is just a random error just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7 99 the cornsticks will be the same size	20
0	just when i thought i was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the us i should have taken more notice of the other reviews beautiful glasses but they are way too small my set will also be returned they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use i would have for them	20
0	the way this steamer was advertised i really thought it gave out alot of steam and lasted a decent amount of time i tried it a few times and was very disappointed i returned the item	20
0	the design is such that when you pour out liquid some of it seeps into the space between the outer plastic and the vacuum glass container then when one sets the carafe on a counter the liquid leaks out this could be a problem with a particular unit or a marginal design	20
0	cat kept peeing on laundry tried this product no change the only thing that worked was constant cleaning changing of litter maybe this works for other cats but not mine	20
0	it looked like such a good idea on tv but that 's the thing about tv they did n't fit well on my stove at all and i could n't even put my other stock pots on my back burners at the same time also the bottom scratched after a couple uses !	20
0	we bought four sets of the victoria collection 600 thread count queen size the fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed it seems like that were made for a full size not queen size list this as a reject we are very very disappointed	20

0	if i had to do it over again i would try a different mat \( something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic \) pros1 reduces tracking somewhat2 more attractive than other litter mats3 does n't take up too much spacecons1 my cat does n't like it most of the time she races out of her domed box just to avoid stepping on it and ends up flinging litter and other stuff that really should stay in the box onto the carpet2 it 's too smal	20
0	i purchased an igloo refrigerator and within a few weeks it completely stopped working curtis international \( igloo 's parent company \) has terrible customer service and will not honor customer warranties after a year of trying to ge this resolved i have found out that they have an unsatisfactory record with the better business bureau and have many of these types of complaints stay away from igloo products ! !	20
0	i purchased this through amazon but returned it i intended to use this with their 3qt 10 inch saute pan but it is huge ! it is not an elegant design for this size pan all clad should have designed a screen that matches this pan instead of a one size fits all from 8 inches to 13 inches furthermore the unique handle that curves over the screen takes more storage room my wife did n't like it back to the drawing boards all clad	20
0	as of today 3 24 i have not received this product very disappointed with delivery	20
0	my company bought one of these to replace the similar capressa 1000 machines which finally broke after n years after 2 days the led readout of the functional information stopped working the machine continues to operate but you ca n't tell what 's going on how much water it will use for your particular cup etc very disappointing we 'll see how good the warranty repair is and report back to you after we experience that	20
0	when we first bought it it worked nicely and smoothly thought we do not need to buy another opener again boy were we wrong ! after the third use it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning reminds me of a car turning it 's wheels will all smoke and noise but no results glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand this opener certainly does damage to the kitchenaid name	20
0	it looked like it would work it turned like a high quality itemit wo n't open even 1 6 of a can as a newlypurchased item go cheap and shop old time stores forcan openers this is an over engineeredbenz lemon of a can opener i'm taking it back to nob hill tomorrowmorning	20
0	it seemed like it would be a great way to store cereal but it made more of a mess than it was worth it spit cereal all over the place i used special k and kashi granola cereal so it may work better if you used it to store something soft like oatmeal or gummy bears ! i returned it	20
0	bought this item two years ago for power plus price the blender ring broke right away and i had to ship it for repair the speedometer has never really worked correctly and eventually broke the blender when it does work is powerful the blender ring recently broke again if you get a good warranty go for it otherwise save your cash for a blender with a good warranty and track record	20
0	corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies usually \( but not always \) oxo products are good at making things easier to do i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork poor design this time oxo	20

0	this has been a nightmare when i received the chair i could n't wait to put it together however the holes for the screws were too big and therefore i was unable to secure the pieces i called and asked if the the right size screws could be sent i was told that there were no provisions for that but they would be happy to send me another one \( i could return the faulty one in that box \) very nice i thought well i got the second one the screws are too small for the holes ! now i am stuck with chair parts all over the house and no chair to sit on ! i do n't recommend this item	20
0	we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them this coffee maker has two problems \( 1 \) its spout is badly engineered it is impossible to pour out the last 3 4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid \( 2 \) it is a thermos so the machine does not heat up the coffee but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed i like hot coffee after the first cup i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave this is inconvenient i would not buy another of this model	20
0	a year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash the swing out filter hinges broke during normal use once broken the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed hence it 's ready for the wastebasket on closer inspection the entire filter unit is made of plastic and the hinges are only a few mm 's in diameter sturdier design needed !	20
0	like everything in the world this coffee maker is lawyer approved in other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee every day i have to warm my coffee up in the microwave	20
0	evidently the people at krups did n't try this coffeemaker before they put it on the market the caraffe is hard to take out and put back in it scrapes the lid every time they say it keeps the coffee warm if you preheat the thermos but why then have a timer \? you need a microwave handy if you want a hot cup of coffee you never know how much coffee is left in the caraffe also you need to turn the caraffe upside down for the last few cups i'm sure this is the last krup 's product i will buy	20
0	saucepan made in indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely there was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit it was in the construction of the pan as a long time user of revere ware we were very disappointed in this product sent to us we will never purchase another revere ware product once burned we will not go back to a second treatment	20
0	i bought cat sitter1 for my 3 cats they enjoyed it so much i gave cat sitter 2 a go what a disappointment ! ! they were bored within 5 minutes of it being on ! the entire dvd is of birds and only birds as compared to cat sitter 1 that has a variety of animals that catches the cats attention span in short segments trust me if you have to choose between the two do n't spend your money on on cs2 however it may appeal to the \( human \) avid bird watcher \( \? \)	20
0	large burner failed after about 12 months use i opened it up the wire between the plug and the resistor had burned not only is it broken it is a fire hazard i lost all the paperwork that came with it and i probably voided the warranty by opening it i think i can fix it but i am not going to risk a fire so i will try another brand	20
0	i just got this thing 2 hours ago in the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working made it through about 8oz try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot nope number one this is nothing more than a typical small hand held grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing do not buy this the others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing	20
0	this item affectionately named r2d2 worked like a champ with all the bells and whistles well actually lights and dials for about 5 weeks and then just stopped thus i'm profoundly disappointed and now without any grinder in fact given its short life the 2 star rating is incredibly generous	20
0	these 'vino grande chardonnay' glasses are less in volume and shorter in height than the spiegeleau stemware previously sold under the same name	20
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven	20
0	i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation motor power and style i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs ! it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet	20
0	i have owned this vacuum for 2 years it was great at first now with a 3 level house it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace if i had to do it all over again i 'd buy something else invest more in a better vacuum not this one	20
0	i bought this product on my mom 's suggestion because she was impressed with the suction power not only did the suction power fade over the first few months of ownership but within 6 months the vacuum was completely broken i called in to customer service because it was still under warranty and they were anything but helpful they sent me to a small shop 45 minutes away to have it fixed which took over a month they even lost my paperwork one month later it broke again and customer service suggested i take it out in my backyard take the vacuum apart and blow the small holes with an air compressor to clean it out for 400 this is ridiculous i want my 100 vacuum back	20
0	i thought this glass would be of better quality than it is it took 3 shipments \( re cieved and returned \) to get my complete order without any breakage these glasses are too fragile and in practice impractical because of the design one must live with fingerprints all over the body of the glass not too appealing when you are observing the legs of your wine recommend that you pass these by	20
0	i got a set of 8 a few months ago first one package arrived with a broken one then all of them ended up broken they break if you fill them with water and try to take them by the side they break if you set them a little too fast on the table one of them broke by just holding it such poor quality i am extremely disapointed but i loved the design though	20
0	i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability but the first \( and only \) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime and the dye used on the moss green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm and has an attractive weave	20
0	i guess misters are hard to make because most of the ones i have bought in my life do n't work out of the box or die shortly after this one did n't even work out of the box there was no mist just air oh well i figured i was taking my chances anyway if you buy this hopefully you have better luck update nowadays most grocery stores sell pre packaged pressurized spray canisters of olive or canola oil it 's like a can of raid except it sprays oil i have found that these work perfectly and last a long time	20
0	i ordered this product 3 months back as they say got into the line this item was part of an larger order so i could have gotten free shipping now i get an email from amazon stating this item has been cancelled as it was further delayed and as i did not respond to thier email for extending the wait time i never got an email and now as the remaining items have been delivered if i need one then i will end up paying shipping too amazon is normally good about these things how can they still have it listed on the site when they are cancelling orders in the pipeline	20
0	this did n't do as well as an old microwve poper i 've used for yers it did n't showa great increase in kernals popped and they were not as light and crispy it is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs' which i could n't find in local stores since i gave several of the poppers as gifts i shopped on line for replacement 'power packs' for all and found the postage handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one \( incredibly light \) pack	20
0	pretty but started rusting on the edges after first wash would not buy these again	20
0	i read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it well that chance did not pay off even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere if anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it	20
0	well its uz hot to the touch and it has n't really seemed to help my cat with her tension maybe she just does n't have a problem that feliway can help anyway i'm not too thrilled speedy delivery though	20
0	while the water tasted better this model did n't last for more than about two months before leaking and eventually spraying water all over the place	20
0	makes good coffee but grinder lid breaks very often and has to be replaced since the lid is costly to replaced we bought a separate krups grinder cusinart does't answer e mails about the problem look at the number of recondition makers for sale and draw your own conclusions	20
0	i have to agree with the review about overflowing and basket popping while this coffee maker does make excellent coffee if you put a grain too much of ground coffee in it it will overflow very frustrating as we like strong coffee because ours has overflowed so many times the metal plate on the bottom has corroded and now it wo n't hold water i 'll never buy this frogware again	20
0	toaster was defective had to send it back cost me 20 in shipping and i have nothing to show for it	20
0	the coffe table arrived broken the item where easy to asemble and look good	20
0	i'm not sure the timer i receib ved works properly the timing mechanism dseems accurate however the sound it makes when the time is up is more like a ticking if you are nor right near it you 'll never hear it	20
0	i ordered this pan even though i had never heard about this brand before but the picture on the site and the product review looked good when i recieved this item the lid that was promised was not shipped the pan looked worn out and it looked factory refurbished i returned the pan today and i promised myself that this is the last time i order brands that i have never heard about through the internet its better to stick to brands like faberware and calphalon which have not caused me any problems earlier and have lasted for such a long time	20
0	a drawback of calphalon 's anodized alumninum is that it cannot be cleaned in the dishwasher but stainless steel is dishwasher safe and amazon 's product description claims that calphalon 's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe but if you check out www calphalon com and look at the description of their stainless line it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent so it is dishwasher safe but you ca n't use dishwasher detergent	20
0	yes it sits in my drawer and that 's all it 's only useful if you have a real dread of trace garlic aroma on your fingers instead i cut off the base of the garlic with a widish knife then put the flat side of the knife on the garlic and whack it with my fist it 's so much quicker and easier the skin comes off no problem plus crushing garlic releases more flavour than merely slicing it	20
0	these glasses are very cheap i sent everyone of them back when i recived them 2 were broken they are very thin	20
0	the first time i used it i could n't even boil water in it on my flat surface stove ! a notice that came with it said this pot may not work on all stoves refer to the owners manual \( no owners manual was sent with it \) as soon as the water started to heat the pot danced and wobbled all over and the water was sloshing out of the top ! nothing in the web site ad referred to the pot not working on a flat surface it would have been nice to have known before ordering as i am not a pro cook and have no special knowledge of these details	20
0	more thought needs to be put into the design of this produc	20
0	do n't waste your money on this unless you like your coffee luke warm \( i ca n't imagine it \) you will not be satisfied with this product i am promptly returning mine	20
0	worked great for a couple months and then the gears stripped out guess you get what you pay for	20
0	after i cracked and ruined my original filter i purchased a new one that insisted the biomax inserts were essential to its functionality having had my original filter for about 6 years i decided to follow the instructions about adding biomax thinking this was a product upgrade i was deeply dissapointed not only did it create cloudy water despite my effort to add clear water drops to resolve this but the lifespan of my fish decreased dramatically i was losing fish every week once i removed the biomax insert the water cleared instantly and my fish started to thrive	20
0	i bought it some time ago for much less also from amazon it is not worth 24 00 may be 6 9	20
0	it 's noisy and expensive you can get that from reading the other reviews on this page ours stopped working within 2 weeks of light use i called the company and when i described the problem they said it was a faulty unit thankfully the store let me return it and i got my money back we have bought the hamilton beach trueair 04381 allergen reducer air cleaner which is cheaper smaller and very quiet most importantly it works ! ! !	20
0	after just a few months of occasional use the lever to lower the bread would not stay down i see now that others have had this problem typical made in china junk no more t fal for us	20
0	this toaster lasted for about 8 months before it started to burn toast on one side even at low settings we are very disappointed with this purchase	20
0	a 1 3 inch split developed in the wood on the spoon 's flat edge after about five uses \( i hand wash and dry promptly \) the same thing happened to the replacement amazon sent amazon great ! ! mario batali not so great	20
0	i'm looking for a timer simple as can be i should have listened to the previous reviews this thing simply did not work right out of the box it would catch at the 20 minute mark and just get stuck there great i would definitely not recommend this product	20
0	for the price you get what you pay for they are not the best quality	20
0	sleep better \? how could you sleep better when your pillow has a warning flamable label \? scary the pillows are soft but does not have great neck support i'm usually a side or stomach sleeper the pillows are better for hugging	20
0	i purchased four of these pillows ! i really should n't have wasted my money they fluff up as soon as you take them out of the bags but after you sleep on them they are flat and impossible to fluff up i 'd rather sleep without a pillow at all ! !	20
0	this was a special offer and the price seemed excellent description stated standard classic white goose down feather pillow a more accurate description would have been mostly feather pillow with some goose down skimpily filled i would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate i e larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content as they did with other catalog items i believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was caveat emptor	20
0	i am totally unimpressed with this set of bowls i received them a few days ago and washed them and one has already managed to crack after falling of the drying rack and into the sink a melamine bowl should be far sturdier than this the orange measuring cup bowls towards the center are nice but the outer bowls are rather flimsy	20
0	i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money	20
0	this fountain is a piece of junk i ordered three of them and all three had cracks and holes in the top piece the top piece is a molded resin that is very thin in places the thin regions easily crack making it unsightly interfering with the performance and within days rendering the fountain unusable i was very disappointed and ended up buying an entirely different fountain	20
0	this filter is not in my estimation any good it leaves a sediment and the end product the coffee tastes terrible use paper filters insted for a great cup of coffee	20
0	i bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago used 2 x daily and cleaned every month with either vinegar or special cleaner unfortunately it began leaking water from outside top of machine very poor quality machine i just threw mine out in the trash bin just got tired of constantly having to mop up after it do n't buy this coffeemaker a waste of good money \( i paid 99 99 \)	20
0	this burner is driving me nuts it was okay for the first 2 weeks took forever to heat up but it would boil water well i am trying to make pasta now and it wo n't even boil the water i would never by another toastmaster product	20
0	do n't buy this product it was ill fitting and incompatible with the coffee maker amazon matched it up with i returned mine and went with paper filters which work so much better and are cleaner	20
0	we had a set of chicago cutlery knives for many years and thought they were good quality over time the wooden handles dried out and the blades did n't sharpen very well so we replaced them with this set but were very disappointed the blades rust after very brief exposure to water we are still using the old ones	20
0	unsatisfied never received the item waited 8 wks before canceling order purchased item at macy'	20
0	poor quality the cover leaks i had to return it back do not buy	20
0	i 've owned one of these for about a month it 's a total waste of money it rarely sprays just a steady stream of oil i'm diabetic and thought this would be a good way to restrict my use of oil on salads etc i am so very disappointed i 'll try to find another brand that is more reliable and that does what it 's advertised	20
0	i placed an online order of the set at ronco and cancelled it 5 minutes later to confirm my concellation is in time i called ronco hours later despite their promise on the phone they still send the package after i refuses to accept the shipment \( follow their instruction \) they still charge me 35 for the shipping these people do business in such disgraceful way how can you expect a good quality product from them	20
0	this wok is heavy and unbalanced it can tip while on the element the long handle is thick and uncomfortable and its solid weight is probably what unbalances the wok lifting it up is difficult with one hand and trying to shift the food to a plate is a dangerous task the flat bottom is n't wide enough to really be stable or to capture enough heat for the high temperature required for stir frying if i wanted to saut i 'd have gotten a saut pan the lid is also heavy and difficult to put anywhere you need lots of counter space as well this wok just is n't large enough for stir frying for more than two people	20
0	i paid what i would call a fairly high price for a blanket i could have gotten from a discount club for half the price the photo is very misleading in that only the top and bottom edges are hemmed the left right sides are simply cut i expect this to disolve within 4 washes will not buy from this manufacturer again	20
0	it looked okay when i opened it then i washed it before using and my washer and dryer were full of cranberry colored lint \( wet in the washer and dry in the dryer \) the next time i washed it was better but still some lint in the washer and normal in the dryer it is not warm enough alone it might be okay in the warmer months but not what i expected for winter	20
0	yes it is pretty no it is not a good teapot i have made tea for over 40 years in all sorts of pots and this is right up there with the worst it drips a lot ! perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout and no it does not drip from the spout rather lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot this happens with both fast and slow pouring with full and near empty pots this teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot just too much mopping up	20
0	i bought this sheet set the newest blue comforter with the light saber duel and the micro bead pillow as a christmas gift for my 9 year old son he too loves star wars and as i read the other reviews im nodding my head these sheets feel like burlap ! i have washed them regularly since december with no improvement they dont fade though which i suppose was the motivation behind the manufacturer making them with 70 polyester and only 30 cotton very stiff and scratchy	20
0	got it to work once but ca n't now dont buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	20
0	i decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it the metal is thin and flimsy and the construction very poor \( e g little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose \) also it was a bit lopsided so it did not sit squarely on my counter maybe it works fine who knows the design and manufacture were so poor i did n't keep it long enough to find out	20
0	i would not recommend purchasing these sheets they are thin not very soft and they wrinkle easily	20
0	the feel of the sheet is good but the details such as the elastic are questionable elastic on fitted sheet is loose and slips off easily	20
0	the bad news about these 300 thread count sheets is that the threads must be so thin as to qualify for supermodel status this causes the fabric to be so thin you can just about see your hand through it also out of the dryer they are quite wrinkled the good news is that the red border color that i chose did not bleed in the washer further they did not shrink at all i do n't know how they feel to sleep on as they are for a guest bed for occasional use only just by the way they look if i were to use them daily i would have returned them	20
0	i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces needless to say it 's useless this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last	20
0	unfortunately i ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead this was not amazon 's fault but emile henry 's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not in fairness to amazon they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled althought i would have preferred the oval bakers i kept the rectangular ones and do like them	20
0	i found it very awkward trying to stabilize the pump with one hand and pull the pump up and down to get the air out also i can not get the top out of the decanter it seems stuck there as a result i can not say if it does what you claim	20
0	first one came cracked second one came chipped gave up	20
0	washed them once \( before using \) and now they look really old they have loose threads hanging out in several places and have small balls all over them i am not impressed would not buy again	20
0	i ordered it on 9 9 at the beginning it would come middle of october it was ok however delivery schedule had been changed it is not arrived yet nor i do not know when it will come amazon knows this delay however they asked me to send a review of it what does it mean \? i rated this item as 1 star it is not for the item but for the seller amason amazon is generally good campany i think however i cannot accept my situation for this honestly saying i want to rate 0 star for this order	20
0	well built take apart to clean very noisy and the setting for the width of slicing moves to much and thickness changes	20
0	i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy i would say this table is worth 20 and no more	20
0	i bought these because i was looking for nice red glass i'm almost embarrassed at the size of them they are not practical but i paid so little it was n't worth sending them back i recently saw them in bloomingdale 's so maybe this is the new trend but they wo n't do anything for your wine	20
0	a few times it worked great but mostly it brewed uneven i'm not being a nitpicker here literally one cup would overflow and the other would be 3 inches below the brim there was no pattern to it sometimes it was the left one sometimes the right one sometimes neither filling the reservoir and seeing where the water level falls is challenging do n't mess up because there are holes in the back and the water will pour right out the back and all over your counter ! it only took two days before i realized this was not worth the money or the time	20
0	i am becoming steadily more disillusioned with the kitchenaid brand this blender is only one of several ka appliances i have purchased that only lasted about a year i do n't use a blender much maybe once a month so when this died after only eleven months i was shocked kitchenaid was no help whatsoever my husband took it apart discovered that the motor still works but the on off switch went bad however we found that having it repaired would cost as much as a new blender ! ! after years of brand loyalty i am sad to say that i will not be buying anymore kitchenaid	20
0	i was very upset with these sheets and how much lint is still coming off it totally clogged my dryer i have washed them 3 times and i still come up with a trap full should have sent them back	20
0	i bought this only because i wanted a pair of stainless shears you do need your muscles though i am using it to remove the fins from fish good luck	20
0	i thought i was getting a set of forks not one fork the picture and description are deceptive the picture depicts a set \( s \) i am sure the one fork i got is great but i have 5 other hands that need a fork as well	20
0	very bad quality not worth to buy it it is not as good as the picture do n't buy it ! !	20
0	i am extremely happy with this product it works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick it 's a superb design and i am very pleased i would highly recommend it	20
0	i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well ca n't win them all	20
0	normally things i purchase have no problem this item is now being used to heat water when company comes over for tea has to be the worse item to make coffee yet always purchase the whole beans and grind the coffee myself this item just never got the coffee 's true wonderful flavor perhaps because it was a refurbished item but i just think hamilton beach needs to improve this item big time	20
0	we had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out when i saw the refurbished for 20 00 i thought it was a great deal it would have been if it had come with all the parts and did n't leak ! ! it did n't come with seals or with the water purifier i tried everything including new seals \( that i bought separately \) eventually we just went out and purchased a new one because we still like the model	20
0	i had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews but it is n't so hot the light is n't very bright and quite diffused and the light sensor is n't sensitive enough it stays on in all but the brightest light i ordered two but have only opened one and the other is likely to stay in its packaging	20
0	ok so i thought i was crazy not being able to make a decent meal with my crockpot people were making fun of me how can you burn anything in a crockpot \? \? now i look at the reviews on this thing and see that i am not alone i always wondered why people liked food out of a crockpot ! now i know that they are not supposed to be like this ! ! ! do not ever buy this thing unless you like scorching burn gunk ! ! ! ! ! on the 10 hour setting it starts boiling within only a few hours ! ! ! ! i am trashing mine today ! !	20
0	i took water temperatures at high low and keepwarm i am at 5200 ft altitude so water boils at about 195 all temps reached 203 and the water was in a rapid boil ! i have a small rival i picked up for 12 and it works great low 190 high 199 and warm 160	20
0	i received these as a wedding gift not five of my tall glasses are broken and two short glasses none of which were from dropping them one broke as i was hand washing them and cut up my hand another literally broke as a guest was drinking out of it i was so embarrassed	20
0	i liked the blinker light when i got it in fact friends noticed it and i referred them here to get it however in short order it went on the blink so to speak the on off mechanics are not well designed and literally half the time the darn thing is such a pain to get working i either take it apart and reassemble it or throw it back in the drawer	20
0	one should n't have to empty water out after every use one should n't be punished with a rusty teapot for leaving water in the pot once or twice that is not a functional teapot if that may be the case though it is the prettiest teapot around it is not very practical if you want to keep it around for a while le creuset products are generally supposed to last a lifetime but the enamelware ca n't even touch the quality of the cast iron cookware fortunately the company stands by its products and i am sending mine back for a replacement see www lecreuset com for details	20
0	i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot	20
0	the set is lovely and coordinates perfectly with my ocr china set the box is also beautiful i wish they 'd give you a diagram for placement of the flatware in the box for those of us who are first timers	20
0	the seals are not air or water tight there is no problem with the cansiter or the clear window but i cannot store any flour or rice type products as the seals are not airtight and allow bugs in them the canisters themselves do not rust and the lids are not easy to remove	20
0	i bought this and used it once right from the begining i could tell this was a shotty product i do n't know who designed the wringing fuction but it does n't work in the least and the removeable cleaning head would not stay attached half the time and i assure you it was inserted correctly waste of money ! !	20
0	unless you look like popeye and or have the ability to rip phone books in half with your bare hands you will struggle to wring this mop out even if you can move the wringer the handle sections slide apart i spent more time putting it back together and cursing than actually cleaning the floor	20
0	the thing did not work right from the beginning and now the tail fell off would not recommend it to anyon	20
0	its an oven timer right \? so why is it made out of cheap plastic that can melt \? the first time it was used was also the last time it was used because it was left on top of the oven while i baked a batch of cookies the heat from the oven melted the back of the timer good thing i also used the timer on the oven clock as a back up or i may have had to pitch the timer and the cookies even if this product were free i would not use one	20
0	we 've had this for about five years the battery went dead but there is no way to change the battery the battery is soldered to the circuit board ! they expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost 20 each way ! i opened it up cut out the old battery and duct taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months cooks rice great though	20
0	i have owned this type of product for years and it works very well this review is to warn others to think twice about ordering it from amazon they shipped the first one damaged then the replacement for the damaged one was much worse than the first one ! very frustrating and time wasting think about it its a plastic product that if not shipped packed properly is going to be damaged and will likely leak water i have ordered many things from amazon for many years and this is the worst result i have seen needless to say i am getting a refund and buying from another retailer	20
0	we have been searching for a solution to our very uncomfortable seats in our ford windstar van this cushion did not help	20
0	i'm a big coffee drinker and i thought the bunn would be a coffee lover 's delight it turned out to be my biggest nightmare it takes a lot to set it up and get it started if you make a mistake and close the cover before you have the pot in place boy what a mess it leaked out the bottom and was very large and heavy took up way to much room on my counter i dumped it after one week and bought a farberware coffee maker and it is just as good if not better it 's small easy to run and the coffee tastes great deb in new hampshir	20
0	sorry but i can still smell the odor plastics absorb odor after a couple of weeks the smell permeated the whole contraption also the tube bag thing does n't last as long as they say i dump baking soda in with the poop every time which seems to help otherwise it 's not worth the money	20
0	this is not a good product it is not a very flixible plastic and breaks easily if dropped or flexed it is also not large enough for some dishes and microwaves nordicware does make a more flexible cover but the advertising for this one is not very clear about features	20
0	it does nothing that i can see except leave a pleasant scent i scrub it in with a firm bristle brush wait 30 minutes vacuum with my dyson and my carpet still looks the same it is only 2 years old so it is n't an old carpet it might work on carpets that are more of a pile but not berber i gave 2 stars just for scent alone	20
0	bought one it quit working within 6 weeks the litter box lid never did fit correctly and the unit just stopped running littermaid sent a replacement the lid on the replacement would n't close either and the tracks for the rake were out of alignment after some fine tuning the unit worked for three days before quitting perhaps this is a good idea whose time has not yet arrived the units i have bought and received are useless as it is i'm out 170 with no hope of a fix	20
0	i have two earlier aerobeds and they are very comfortable and conforms to support our bodies this new premier durasuede is like lying on a sheet of tin the material is so stiff it does not conform to our body i find it unusable	20
0	this flan pan is very flimsy and do n't hold up well	20
0	the wire broke off as i was slicing my first slice of chedder cheese needless to say i do not recommend this cheese slicer last i checked they 're supposed to last longer than one slice maybe mine was faulty but regardless i expect better	20
0	you never ever use an electric wok to cook chinese food it is all about the fire and the intensity of the heat only people that use this are people whom have no idea what they 're doing do yourself a favor and purchase a real wok	20
0	has to be seasoned just about everytime before use overwise great pan	20
0	i ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser when it arrived the teapot was broken with a large section missing from the side i returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after i received a refund only for the items price after receiving my second teapot it was cracked in the exact same spot i returned the product and complained with no response i was refunded the price for the teapot but i am out 10 in the cost of shipping it seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot so i would try a different product	20
0	i did what i think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product and the euro pro was bad decision the product would n't even turn on much less work the packaging indicated it had passed qulaity control whatever that means this was a christmas gift that totally flopped the euro pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and i assumed the price was equal to the quality boy was i wrong if you 're purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands this will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another euro pro too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to deepfried japanese dumplings for christmas a real disappointmen	20
0	i have purchased 2 of these from amazon neither worked i tried buying them from bed bath beyond neither worked this is a horrible company there fryers are delivered non working there sweepers are bad and get recalled if they didnt catch fire very poor product development better off buying t fal	20
0	the handle and pump mechanism for this dispenser are cheesy plastic they will not last at all the previous reviewer also pointed out correctly that the honey drips out very slowly not worth the money they should have used a metal handle and pump and charged a reasonable price for decent quality not worth your money	20
0	i could not believe it was for only one cup i did not read throughly and thought it was for four big dissapointment	20
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven	20
0	i'm sure it will get a 5 star if i ever get the item i placed the order on 2 6 07	20

0	i have the black version but i'm writing reviews for the white and red as well to save you from buying this toaster model from day one it has n't been able to toast anything evenly be it frozen fresh refrigerated bread bagel english muffin you name it if you do n't believe me see the photo i uploaded the toast is burnt and raw at the same time	20
0	hi really like drinking wine from these glasses ended up with 8 each in two sizes broke my 4th glass the other day while cleaning it never broke any other end high stemware doing that believe me i 've been very careful too also had one break in a very modern dishwasher operating on a crystal cycle just too thin and fragile despite the resonable price and good functionalit	20
0	i purchased this reconditioned item primarily to toast english muffins which i eat regularly strangely i had to set it all the way up to its darkest setting \( 9 \) just to get the muffin to be somewhat browned i would routinely have to toast more than once to get the desired level of toasting i suspect there was something wrong with mine but who knows \? i returned my kitchenaid and ordered a krups toaster i am hoping for better results	20

0	i have been searching for a baster with an injector this one looked good it works ok with the injector but it does not work at all as a regular baster i guess i will keep searching	20
0	i bought these because i was sick of creating foil shields on the pies i bake i love that these slip perfectly on and off however i 've found that since they 're made of metal or aluminum they actually conduct heat and cause the crust of the pie to darken faster than the center which is exactly what i didn't want it to do that said i have to admit that while the edges of my pies look darker than the rest it has n't come out burnt as it would if i were to bake the pie without any sort of shield i'm planning on buying another brand 's something made from silicone instead	20
0	we are very disappointed in the peformance of this toaster the bread will toast good on the inside but barley on the outside i sent email to west bend and was told the maybe the bagle switch was stuck no help if i return it shipping cost makes it not worth it good appearance and company name fooled me fy	20
0	the coffee pot came with the down and timer buttons stucked together sent it back and received replacement quickly it was great when it worked after the 3rd day it did n't come on as programed and the down button got stuck again the weather display was neat too bad it did n't work out i think there is a design fault on the machine but i have to say amazon has great customer service we received our replacement very fast	20

0	these lights are junk but the vendor i purchased them from is excellen	20

0	i used this light at my computer desk because i wanted something that would give off a soft light so i could still see to type after everyone went to bed and less than a couple of hours later the light began to fade the batteries \( brand new \) died	20
0	i was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer i have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were i bought them because i liked the color and the red is a very pretty bright color i would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets or dry them on low heat the material of the sheets is fairly thin so i am not sure how long they will last	20
0	this is an ugly vase so ugly we are returning it the day we received it it does not measure up to mikasa standards at all it looks and feels like a cheap vase one would buy at target we were very disappointed stick to the clean lean lines of other mikasa crystal vases	20
0	this product is the worst there is i purchased it in a target store going by the oster name it takes forever for it to heat up and then another long wait for the waffle to be almost done needless to say i am taking it back	20
0	we waited too long to try this out after it came we would return it if it was n't so late it takes forever to warm up and forever to cook ! then the waffle is not hot ! not happy at all with it	20
0	we bought these for our two girls \( 2 and 5 \) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great for a while now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time \( 5 months since we ordered \) they have n't been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat same issue with the bowls ymmv but when 3 out of 4 are dead i think there is a problem	20
0	the rainbow 600 count egyptian sheets were so irregular that the seams on the pillowcases were not square i returned them	20
0	this product arrived in what appeared to be good shape but upon washing became blotchy and discolored in places making them unusable very disappointed	20
0	i purchased this fryer after the death of our previous deep fryer thinking you get what you pay for so i splurged yes i read the reviews which had a lot to do with my decision to purchase this particular fryer mistake no one explains that the plug is extremely short or the fact that the magnet holding this heavy cord has a difficult time keep it plugged into the fryer the temperature does n't seem to stay consistent as my previous fryer yes i know that adding food to the oil will reduce the temp after only 6 months with average use of once per month it 's dead bewar	20
0	usually break free product but smashed in amazon delivery and then had to wait 4 weeks for credit boo	20
0	as great as it looks i ca n't get past the incomplete directions \( only printed outside of the box no directions inside \) to get it installed on the wall it says pull out the plastic end cap have n't a clue what the plastic end cap is nor how to pull it out nor how to install the screws that hold it on the box may have to return	20
0	i bought this wok 6 months ago i seasoned it very well and started to use it but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce it meant i could n't use it for steaming when i made a fried rice i had a hard time to clean it and re season it most chinese use a wok to cook everything so i expected i could do that too but i was wrong this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry that 's all	20
0	this toy didn't even last 3 minutes he had the stuffing out in 10 seconds flat	20
0	the first time i tried using this machine to make beef jerky it shut off in the middle of the process i had to stay next to it for 8 hours making sure it did n't shut off when it shut off i had to take the cover off and let the machine cool down and this happened about 15 times what a pain ! i called the company and they said that they would send me a new one but i needed to ship the old one to them at my cost what ! this is a brand new machine used once and i have to pay to ship the machine back buy a different machine	20
0	i bought it did n't work exchanged it the new one did n't work same problem the pump is very weak and just barely seaps out a few drops of liquid soap that 's all and yes it does very easily rust spend the extra 5 and get something better	20
0	it leaks from the top barely drips from the pump but it looks great	20
0	although this item 's description says it is made of commercial quality stainless steel it arrived with several rust spots so much for whatever commercial quality stainless steel means also be aware that the handles are not round but are u shaped it is difficult to clean the inner part of the handle short of using a small toothbrush on the positive side the locking mechanism seems to work well and i do like the non stick silicone tips however on the whole i would not recommend these locking tongs	20
0	do n't buy this wok it tastes like you are eating metal when you cook cabbage with tomatoes i ended up returning the second wo	20
0	i placed my first order for the red casserole in march it was not slated to be delivered until may ! but i waited patiently for it in may i see that it has finally been shipped and delivered to my house but i never received it so they send a replacement and it is white not red and apparently they no longer have red	20
0	amazon is out of red after waiting for 2 months they shipped a white while the packing list states red when contacted they said that they do not have a red for replacement if i want a white i can get it elsewhere for 7 99 not i have to go through the trouble of returning it	20
0	i bought a blue one the mug looks nice enough but it cracked the first time i filled it with hot water for tea get your act together guys it really is not so difficult to make dishes that can withstanda little heat as for the claim that this can go in the microwave after the mug cracked idid n't bother to try	20
0	looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet item is being returned	20
0	how does it create space \? if you have a cabinet that is 12 inches high 15 inches deep and 14 inches wide and put this large plastic item inside it will that give you more space or take it away \? the manufacturers must not be very logical or are trying too hard to sell you something you do n't need	20
0	the metal side arms that the drawer slides down on were binding and need some lubrication somewhat flimsy i do not expect it to last long nice concept but i wish they had used better materials	20
0	i got the expensive one rather than the 14 99 aroma cooker thinking it will be better quality wrong i only used it twice not only the rice get burn after i clean in and out of the cooker it still look dirty the quality of the material was really bad i think the store where i got this products knows the problem that they take my return even it past 15 days requirement do not waste your good earned money on this one	20
0	i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone the coffee does taste funny and i did n't realize it might be the metal pot also do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out just like one of the other reviewers said the pot does not slide in and out easily not a coffeemaker i would recommend the only thing i like about it is the size ! ! ! ! ! !	20
0	this fan has nice features and operates very quietly seems to be a durability issue with most reviews i 've read because mine only made it nine months before konking out	20
0	very disappointed with this fan failed within six months of purchasing do n't buy a lasko fan	20
0	i expected better durability out of this fan it died after just 3 months and had flow problems from day one i tried contacting lasko but got no responses	20
0	this percolator is not worth the price the coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot i returned mine and purchased the farberware fcp512s 12 cup cordless percolator i love it !	20
0	we purchased this purcolator for christmas 2003 every other pot is weaker than tea many grounds are left in the bottom of the pot once the coffee is done the warmer continues to boil the coffee making it bitter and burnt the auto shut off did not work and boiled the pot dry i am returning the pot and purchasing a farberware for half the price	20
0	we purchased this purcolator christmas 2003 and ended up returning the first one after it did not work out of the box amazon was great in sending us out another via exchange the second percolator worked however i wished i 'd have saved my money the coffee basket allowed too many coffee grounds to end up in the coffee do n't take that last cup you will also need a carafe to store the coffee in after percolating the percolator maintains the heat too high when ready and boils the coffee continuously mmmm burnt coffee !	20
0	this mixer was highly reviewed at the time we bought it but ours started conking out randomly after only 2 months it would work one day and then not work the next whether it will work any particular time is uncertain enough that we are buying a new one today no matter what the features an appliance has that rates an automatic 1 star in my book	20
0	this is a cute vacuum and that 's about it the filter clogs and they are next to impossible to find the canister is a pain to empty the biggest problem i found was there was no height adjustment if you have thick carpet you just need to forget about this vacuum what a nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing mine has gone to goodwill	20
0	this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access however it is not a good sharpener it sharpens knives but not well also it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash probably half a year and it will be useless spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year	20
0	the armoire arrived with the doors damaged and a nick on the top i was sent new doors but they did n't fit frustrated i accepted the promised 175 00 off to keep the doors knowing they would have to be repaired by my husband later i have yet to receive this refund the delivery was also a major problem there was only one guy and he said he was told to leave the furniture in the driveway and go there was no way i could get this furniture in my house alone so i tipped him to bring it in for me i will never buy anything from this company again ! ! ! ! ! !	20
0	the lid drops in half the time you 're trying to put it on the first six meals or so smell bad \( spoiled \) as they are cooking i think it 's the sealing ring ! what a god awful smell for a kitchen	20
0	i bought this item based on price how can you go wrong for 10 for a programable coffee maker \? well you get what you pay for after having this coffee pot for only 3 weeks it just stopped working ! just to ship it back would have been the cost of the item ! based on the rest of the reviews i just threw away and went out and bought a mr coffee lesson learned treehous	20
0	i just got this took it out of the box plugged it in and it does not work	20
0	i bought this as it was just a little bit bigger than my preent coffee maker i could get 3 mugs of coffee out of it rather than 2 however i used it exactly 5 days and then it died granted the econonical price was a factor when i purchased it but i really expected it to last more than 5 days unfortunately it would have cost me more than it was worth to have it fixed so i was forced to throw it away lesson learned some things are just not a bargain ! !	20
0	ordered this item as a gift for my daughter arrived quickly and did not appear broken or used but would not work at all appliance would not activate very disappointing probably why it was such a deal shipping was as much as the item ! valentine surprise failed	20
0	loose shape and becomes literally towels within 3 months of use total waste of money and shipping	20
0	i purchased this item after having read about banneton in the book rustic european breads from your bread machine the picture clearly shows 4 baskets and the description is vague but you only get one the basket you get is quite small all but the smallest loaves would quickly overflow the basket it looks sturdy and well made it would have been good value for four baskets it was too much to pay for a single basket i did n't actually use it choosing instead to return it so i ca n't comment on how well it worked	20
0	this is a great sweeper but its tragic downfall is the short lifespan of the battery we bought one a couple of years ago from sears with a sears replacement warranty since then we have replaced it five times \( we really got our money 's worth from the warranty at least ! \) it 's getting to be a joke one day \( usually 2 3 months after we bring home the new one \) the rotor just stops turning and that 's all she wrote next time we will purchase a different sweeper warranty or not	20
0	many times i 've come across great deals on amazon where i 've paid just little for a lot this is not one of those moments this pan feels like it 's made from three layers of tin foil it 's shockingly flimsy	20
0	i bought this power mop for my daughter for christmas and it broke the first time she used it	20
0	had trouble finding out how to put it together then the motor started and would not stop had trouble getting the bottom in the right angle to stop it and then the slightest movement and it would go on again i would return it but it is too heavy to move heavy to move to make it change to mop part from brush part and making the motor stop was a formidable task i will let he battery run out and try it a few more times and try to use it just as a heavy mop that should not take too long	20
0	i was kind of disappointed with the black decker power mop it is to bottom heavey to flip the scrubbing brush easily you have to use two hands to flip the brush down and two hands to push the brush away i have already told friends do n't bother to spend 49 for this mop it is n't worth the money get a women to design this product i ca n't believe a women would have found this easy to use	20
0	this was a horrible egg slicer i thought something from kitchenaid that was advertised to slice strawberries or mushrooms would be worthwhile but was i wrong worked fine for eggs but broke on the first strawberry my previous one broke on the first mushroom ! do n't bother use a knife save the slicer for the eggs	20
0	i wish i had read the customer reviews before purchasing this my wife just tried to use our kitchenaide egg slicer for the first time and two of the wires snapped as she tried to slice up some strawberries do not purchase this egg slicer ! it is a waste of 10	20
0	whatever you do don't buy a shark it is a total waste of money it has to be the worst purchase that i have ever made you cannot contact the manufacturer smart move on their part their phone system would be overloaded with complaints	20
0	i received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time however as other reviewers noted almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day i was n't intending to use the delay feature very often so i did n't bother to return it now just short of a year after i received it it suddenly started working so i'm shopping for a replacement i might try another mr coffee model with better reviews but not this one	20
0	my order was cancel because company will not ship to a fpo fpaddress really unclear as to the reason but i am sure it isa fine product my turtles will continue to bask on their rock	20
0	i would not use this unless it had a featherbed on top i have two other waterproof pads from bloomingdales that are more expensive but much softer	20
0	hopefully i will never make this kind of mistake	20
0	all 6 of of the glasses in my set were at least slightly misshapen one was positively a mutant ! the stems were not centered and there were for lack of a better description glass tumors where the bowls meet the stems the glasses were also thicker than i expected from spiegalau other spiegalau items i 've purchased have been superb so this could very well be an anomaly	20
0	i'm not sure how well this coffeemaker works i purchased one from amazon and received one that was obviously in used condition the glass was water stained and not factory packaged there was n't a manual or any instructions 1 star for amazon on this one	20
0	i did not find these pillows comfortable for airplane travel they are too big and bulky to provide any comfort i guess they would be fine if you were laying on a couch and not sitting mostly upright like on a plane i would have been better off saving my money and using the airplane pillow i would n't recommend these particular pillows	20
0	this is a great maker for american coffee drinkers who have the occasional espresso this will not pass for a full time espresso drinker the machine functions fine but the coffee is not robust enough to be called true espresso	20
0	i am usually very happy with hilfiger home products well these towels are run of the mill discount linen store quality there is nothing luxurious about them whatsoever i would expect to pay around 10 bucks for each they are not worth it i do n't know what the heck kind of towels some of the other reviewers were using before they bought these ! !	20
0	so this clock woke me up alright ! the snooze did n't work and then i could n't turn it off ! i had to rip the batteries out of it to get it to stop it is very cheaply made \( explains the price i guess \) but yeah it works just fine as long as you do n't need to use the snooze ever	20
0	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided much smaller than anticipated i can only fit a tablespoon in it	20
0	if you 're of italian heritage and you grate a lot of cheese do n't waste your time with this one when the quantity of cheese in the grater gets low it tends to be very difficult to turn it also did n't last as long as i expected try a different one instead	20
0	this grater is fine when you can get it to work but most often the handle does n't screw in correctly and you ca n't get it to it 's mostly a waste of time though the concept is a great one i 'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one	20
0	this grater is not a convenience it 's more of a punishment i have tried it for hash browns cheese chocolate etc i thought at first i was using it incorrectly but then realized there really is no wrong way of using this everytime i have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that i would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually my fingers and hands ache so bad that i ca n't even hold a pencil after using this gadget i would not recommend this to anyone unfortunately you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star but in reality i give it no stars !	20
0	after two months a piece of the filter broke off after 3 months the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere cuisinart was kind enough to direct me to their website so i could pay another 30 or so for a new carafe because glass is not included in their warranty no thanks	20
0	these are great towels if you can get them they are very soft and a great price but i ordered them in december and they came in one at a time took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock when i ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship buy these only if you have a life time to get the	20
0	the bed warmer was described as dual controlled it comes with only one control the entire bed has to be at the same temperature the reason i wanted dual control was because my husband is always warm and i'm almost always cold hence seperate controls were needed since we had the coldest winter in years i adapted the product to work because there was no time to return and request what was described it does heat well though	20
0	i was very disappointed to find the iron broken so i have no idea if it worked well now i have the expense of sending it back plus i wo n't be able to use it for my holiday parties	20
0	i bought this unit a few years back worthless at best ! i wish someone even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units i called their customer service who said good luck as their best solution the problem is aluminum cools off too fast it will not retain heat i wish i could locate a cast iron krumkake ! do they make them anymore \? ebay help ! !	20
0	i received this popper as a gift and while it looks nice it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine i have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn nothing worked if i had the receipt it would already have been returned since i do n't it is going in the garbage also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine stay away from this machine	20
0	my gf loves popcorn so i was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo 10 air popper i saw this one and thought what a great idea and bought it on the spot i had n't read the reviews here when i did my heart sank although some people did rate it high and said it was great sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true slow popping with small kernals it makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere if you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model it 's simply too slow and requires a breather it was returned yesterday	20
0	i have owned a few oxo brand utensils over the past few years and in general i have been happy with them but i was disappointed with this spatula when the edge of the head melted the very first time it was used the product description does warn you that it 's only heat resistant to 250 degrees but i was flipping eggs in a skillet which i consider a basic use for a spatula if it ca n't handle the heat of a hot skillet than i do n't think it 's a useful spatula not to mention that it 's neither healty nor esthetically pleasing to have bits of black plastic in your food	20
0	we received it broken i do n't have the oriinal box to send it and do n't know what to do so just bought another one in a local stor	20
0	product worked well for several months providing sufficient heating for moderate sized space however heater now only provides heat for approximately 1 2 minutes after turning on then sparks and the heating mechanism fails dangerous for a space heater no	20
0	i opened one of the packages and there was blood on the card that the sham was folded around i promptly called amazon and they replaced it it was a waste of money the first time i washed them white patches appeared all over the shams as if they dye washed out i was very very disappointed with the quality and will not order them again do n't waste your money	20
0	my wife and i have used this machine for several weeks now we found it to be a great machine for the price others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands so i immediately machined an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other american vacuums now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on this thing is lite strong and easy to empty the cord retractor is a little lite so i would n't be to rough with it garrett and susan	20
0	we ordered one of these racks and it was ok then we ordered another one and one of the pieces was bent making it impossible to contruct target replaced it and the replacement was similarly defective not worth the hassle of going back and forth to the post office	20
0	this fan does not have enough power to even come close to blowing out the hot air from even the smallest room go for the industrial strength expensive ones	20
0	for the price i expected a quality canister the plastic insert in the lid arrived unglued and hardly creates an airtight seal had i seen this item in a store i would have passed on it immediately	20
0	the stainless steel lid has a glued in plastic piece that is supposed to provide an airtight seal to the canister my canister arrived with the plastic piece no longer glued in place i expected a bit more from a 50 coffee canister i'm returning it and going in search of a quality canister	20
0	the complaints about the pepper grinder squeaking and spitting out huge chunks of peppercorns are 100 true try to avoid this one if you can i would try to get a refund but it 's just not worth the hassle what a waste	20
0	unless you love the look of this pepper grinder i 'd suggest you look elsewhere when compared to a generic grinder this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds i 've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them with this grinder you 'll always get a huge variation in the grind some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable you 'll have trouble turning it not recommended	20
0	i bought this blender because i liked its retro design and i thought it would function well well every single time i 've tried to use it has been a disaster even for very simple tasks like blending soft avocado the blender has not worked the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything it 's horrible and i even threw away my old ugly blender when i bought this one and the other worked just fine	20
0	i followed the instructions many times but still ca n't get the cork pulled out of the wine bottle the oster wine opener cork screw goes in just fine however instead of pulling out the cork the cork screw just reverses direction and comes out of the cork i'm 75 and bought this after reading a review on how great it was for older folks with arthritis well maybe i have a lemon but i certainly would love someone from oster tell me is i'm doing something wrong thank you for the opportunity to bring this to someone 's attentio	20
0	i liked the product until it showed a small split in the bottom and developed a slow leak after only a few uses perhaps the plastic does n't tolerate boiling water as well as it should	20
0	clock started losing time the first day great tasting coffee no problem with the carafe unit stopped working all together after about 10 days returned it to delonghi they promptly sent me another clock started losing time the first day great tasting coffee no problem with the carafe unit stopped working all together after about 10 days this could get real old	20
0	i bought this to avoid buing and expensive mandoline to make my sweet potato fries what i leared is the sweet potatoes are too hard for this cutter to work well neither my husband or i could get the sweet potato to cut we had to take it out and chop them by hand it works very good on regular and smaller potatoes though	20
0	i bought this for my husand as a gift and it is awful it fell apart the first time we used it it even caught his hand when it fell apart and drew blood i do not recommend this product at all	20
0	very thin and unsteady could n't open it without having to hold the back of it it wobbled side to side as i was forcing it to open i sent it back as soon as i got it	20
0	these sheets were quite thin and like the label said needed touch up ironing on every square inch i wo n't accept the excuse that you get what you pay for i did n't intend to buy 13 sheets these were sold as 40 sheets marked down to 12 99 but i ca n't imagine anyone paying 40 for them this is not what i expect from amazon	20
0	i ordered this griddle and on the third use the teflon coating burned off onto my glasstop stove i called faberware directly since i was out of my return period and after explaining my situation they sent me another \( different model \) griddle free of charge the first product didnt work out but the mfgr made good	20
0	they look nice but the towels do not absorb much water i am very disappointed i suspect i 'll use them a few times then give them to goodwill	20
0	i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice	20
0	way off target said 350 degrees when in reality it was almost 500 doesnt work	20
0	i bought this oven recently it is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job all except the rotisserie when used grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full i was very dissapointed i contacted them via email today they say they will get with me in 24 hrs we 'll see	20
0	i bought a haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months i called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one i have waited 2 months and made 17 phone calls and still nothing do not buy anything from this company their products are cheap chinese junk and they do not stand behind their products do n't believe me \? look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and zero customer support	20
0	the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder does n't work disappointing	20
0	neither the salt mill or pepper grinder work well it takes forever to get salt and pepper from the squeezing of the handles together and still not an adequate amount perhaps the blades that crunch the s p are not sharp enough \? very disappointed in product	20
0	when you first unwrap these sheets they look and feel great but the true test is once they 've been washed a few times they do n't hold up at all they pill after only a couple of washings and are thin and flimsy i was really looking forward to giving these a great review but i ca n't	20

0	i initially bought this coffeemaker because i remembered my dad 's sunbeam silex type coffeemaker it made great coffee and so does the bodum problem with the bodum is that i had to send the unit back three times because of leakage in the lower unit between the heating element and the carafe which uses a polycarbonate material the folks at bodum have been very responsive and accommodating but admit that they have not solved this problem i am anticipating buying the stove top glass contruction version if i continue to have a problem	20
0	i bought this machine after researching it for a long time i could deal with the hard cleaning of it i was willing to shell out 100 00 for a good quality maker and i loved the design after two or three uses it started to leak after much searching i realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short i paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly i did n't return it i just will never buy bodum again	20
0	see other reviews for a description of overall performance and cleaning cool design but overpriced and requires the use of nearly twice as much coffee to arrive at a similar strength to that typical of a french press i only used this coffee maker 3 times and reverted to the press	20
0	i bought this item drinkwell fresh water fountain and reservoir for cats or small dogs fountain \( 6 cup capacity \) from petsmart at amazon though the title clearly advertises that a reservoir is included one did not arrive i contacted customer service who told me that the reservoir is not included and would only assist me in ordering one otherwise the unit is nice though simple i will be returning it used to purchase elsewhere	20
0	this is junk the blades tore through the plastic with the first potato i tried to slice the apple slicer broke on the 4th apple the blades are not sharp and takes considerable force to get it to slice anything the julianne attachment would not slice a block of chedder though i do think any attachment would be able to slice brie and if not that then perhaps jello worst purchase i ever made with the name kitchenaid on it	20
0	this item comes with many warnings as it should it can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet the product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house	20
0	the pop corn is very good but the lid broke i am going to look for one that has a solid metal top but the pop corn is great and you can put sugar in there with the oil and salt to form glaze and cinamon pepper chinese five spice and so o	20
0	i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice	20
0	we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen clean up was a breeze too the worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one	20
0	my friend was ecstatic when she opened up this present from me at the holidays she claims it 's the best spice rack very durable stylish and does n't take up too much space on the kitchen counter to prove her point she went and bought fresh spices and made her own personalized spice rack definitely was a hit	20
0	not what i expected i thought it did duo patterns of rosettes but only does one i ca n't not use other rosette patterns with the set it does n't remain the heat so it took longer to make the cookies	20
0	i thought i was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price but instead i got what a paid for and nothing more cheap product at a cheap price only used a few times literally 2 3 times then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined they feel really cheap too if you only want to use them a few times get them i know we will never get these again	20
0	i purchased this topper june 2006 and at first loved it this was a great purchase until it started to shrink deflate and discolor what a waste ! the pad used to be 3 inches think but it has shrunk significantly in all directions and thickness it has lost its cushiony quality and is now uncomfortable there also appears to be no way to get in touch with the company to inquire about what has gone wrong here	20
0	this timer arrived in two pieces top half and bottom half they could be reconnected but would never stay connected this is a piece of junk that i have thrown away made in china	20
0	my timer did n't work either it arrived broken in two pieces and even though i was able to put it back together it just did n't work back it went it 's cute but pretty much useless	20
0	this product is not eligible for free shipping yet it ships from the amazon warehouse along with the humidifier that is eligible for free shipping	20
0	i love water filters this perhaps is my third first was a brita gave to family member years ago and it is still in use went on to faucet style but prefer pitchers then to this ultra this pitcher leaks i suspect it is the style leak is not big time but pitcher will have to be replaced wayyyy too soon in a household where there is no rough treatment of kitchen items i am not happy elain	20
0	it 's weird the handle is so nicely designed with rubbery grips and that handsome emeril logo then you have the whisk part which is kind of cheaply made rough plastic which loses it 's shape easily you 'd hope the manufacturers would put the same effort into the actual whisk as they did in the handle but not here it 's not a bad whisk for the price but if you want a nice whisk and are willing to spend a couple more dollars buy something else	20
0	although the press has a timer i found that it does not operate as expected it does not seem to reset quickly after opening so i ended up timing myself i like that it can be stored on it 's side	20
0	this item has not functioned at all for me removable of the battery cover required rubber gloves for traction and the opener would not open a 2 3 4 inch diameter can a cute little useless item	20
0	we 've had this foam mattress topper for a couple of weeks and it 's ok but nothing special it does not significantly improve the comfort of the bed nor provide any improvements in sleep quantity or quality	20
0	the first dishwasher that i received from etronics was dented dirty and looked as though it had been used i complained they picked it up and one month later i got the replacement it was n't in much better shape but i kept it anyway because i was tired of waiting the dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes and although it cleans well the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made and it leaks even with teflon tape i would not make this purchase again	20
0	bad quality on off switch and plastic ring broken after 1 year	20
0	my kids think this is a better toy than our dog was n't worth the money i paid for it comes apart too easy	20
0	this coffeemaker does not keep coffee hot and fresh for hours as the user booklet says even if you first fill the carafe with hot water and let it set before brewing if you want a cup 45 minutes after brewing it is luke cold ! i was emptying the carafe right after brewing into another thermal carafe that actually keeps coffee hot just to avoid reheating cup after cup in the microwave ! it is hard to clean and very loud	20
0	i might have bought these pans if i could find out how deep they are	20
0	i was cooking 5 strips of bacon on the platter in the microwave and the platter actually cracked in half ! i have cooked bacon on my other platters with no problem this is dangerous and annoying i could n't find sango customer service anywhere therefore had to return to retailer etc	20
0	poor carafe design makes this mr coffee machine a waste of money we bought this model to replace our old mr coffe machine after we broke the carafe and could n't purchase a replacement for that model we loved our old mr coffee but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because as other reviewers have noted it 's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee water everywere after the first few uses we decided to purchase a different coffee maker	20
0	i 've had this coffeemaker for two weeks i bought it because i had an old mr coffee that worked fine but was white and stained i liked that this was black and looked sleek the very second time i used it the off button stuck so you can no longer turn off the machine but have to wait for it to turn itself off also every pot has grounds in it i'm using the filters that came with it and have never even filled it to capacity and i ca n't figure out why there are always grounds in my coffee piece of junk do n't buy it	20
0	looks quite cheap not as good from the pictur	20
0	within 2 weeks the pause brew did n't exist the coffee poured all over when i tried to pull the carafe for a cup my attempts at fixing it were for naught what a waste of money ! i'm not one who returns items i just wo n't buy braun again !	20
0	this coffeemaker is a huge disappointment ! the stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere and if you do not use additional paper filters you get coffee grains in summary a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee the plus \? the water filter but that is it	20
0	i bought this coffee maker because of its compact size but returned it a week later i found it very difficult to avoid spillage when pouring the water into the coffee maker and the coffee into a cup the problem was worse if making more than 4 cups another problem was the taste of the coffee i like my coffee full of flavor i have been using drip coffee makers for several years and think i know how to get the coffee just right but every carafe of coffee from this tasted weak and much too hot almost scalding !	20
0	package arrived quickly oven looks really nice oven burns toast even on lowest settings !	20
0	do n't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so called slow cooker just like most people have reported the unit runs very hot ! this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control after a couple of burnt meals i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch unfortunately i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i could n't return it as a result of this experience and wasting my good money i will avoid buying rival products in the future	20
0	read the fine \( or missing \) print carefully this is not a general purpose vacuum purchase you need to buy the carpet attachment to be able to vacuum carpets \( another 100 \) if you want to return this item they charge a restocking fee of 10 and also deduct for the shipment \( even if you got free shipping \) and you pay to ship the thing back we ended up buying locally from sears and are much happier with it than from central vacuum stores which is where the miele came from	20
0	i really like the look of the toaster and it does a nice job on one side the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other will be trying to get it repaired or likely will have to get a new one	20
0	the towel is quite soft however after using it your body will be covered with small fibers all over not recommended	20
0	this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years it brews very quickly losing a cup or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top the coffee is weak and bitter \( no matter what brand we have tried \) about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on the same thing has happened twice more this coffeemaker is a piece of junk	20
0	why do most of us buy sharper image \? most of the times their products work well and they look great this heater looked great in the picture it ends there i bought three thinking i would keep one for myself and two for friends there 's no way i would give this to a friend maybe a stranger whom i did n't care about giving the wrong impression pros it 's small con it looks cheap it feels cheap it does n't work at all if it did n't have the sharper image logo on it i would guess that it was a 5 dollar clearance item at walgreens	20
0	i hated these shakers i got them as a gift and 1 they are too big and take up too much space and 2 the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3 the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out the other smaller fiesta ware ones the round ones are much much better	20
0	this product does work and produces great tasting water for a while i thought maybe we 'd done something to make it leak but a guest said his did the same thing in about the same amount of time \( approx 8 months \) there 's a part of the filter assembly that becomes loose and leaks and then eventually squirts water all over the place there is no way to fix it we wo n't be buying this brand again	20
0	this product did not come with all that was advertised	20
0	we were very disappointed upon opening the package to see how small the glasses are i was concerned about this when i purchased them but could find no info on size \( and the seller is very careful to not show them near anything else that might give you a hint as to how small they are \( 2 inches in diameter at the largest point and only 4 1 4 inches tall i can hide the entire glass in my closed fist \)	20
0	the product came chipped on the bottom so its lopsided much smaller than anticipated i can only fit a tablespoon in it	20
0	i prefer my spoons to stand upright many of my spoons fall out of this one i guess it depends on your shape of the spoon	20
0	i did n't get this order did you credit my credit card if so email me with the conf number and when the credit was given	20
0	the frother works well as others have said unfortunately it broke very easily when i dropped it into the sink while cleaning i 've only had it 3 or 4 months but did not save any warranty info this device needs to be made stronger to withstand normal kitchen events	20
0	after reading all of the positive reveiws and only a few negative ones i purchased this humidifier back in dec well here it is early feb and this thing just plain sucks i have a digital humidistat sitting right next to it in a med size room \( 13x13 \) and it never reaches higher that 29 in the dry months of winter 29 is unacceptable and my eyes nose and throat would agree so do n't do what i did and save your money or if you must try it just be prepared to send it back or donate it to goodwill enjoy	20
0	i 've had two of these stop working when used with olive oil sadly though the canola oil one is still going strong	20
0	walnut tradition kitchen scissors \( asin b00005am7r \) do not have comfortable wood handles secured with triple brass rivets they have unattractive chocolate brown plastic handles the bottle opener and screw driver extensions are a poor design feature and simply get in the way	20
0	from the description i thought these would be a lot more sturdy they 're fine for storing light weight items that you do n't need to access often but i found that the plastic supports tended to break through the fabric at the corners and break in half if stressed	20
0	this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use it removes the air with a fan there is air left in the bag it does n't create a vacuum the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags they are thinner than ziploc bags you cannot use canisters with this one	20
0	it is a very lovely two piece set and amazon shipped it to me twice and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards i gave up but from what i could tell from the remains this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear i'm not sure considering the shipping problems whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher	20
0	i placed a substantial order mattresses sofa set table set and cocktail tables with this vendor and they cancelled my shipment becuase the cost to deliver the items they said was too much nothing in their ads states they will cancel your order for such a reason and they state the shipping charge on the items and their site this was a great inconvenience to me and i feel they are not a reputable dealer and do not conduct their business in an honorable fashio	20
0	i gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months even cut through chicken bones but just like the other reviews the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment i used these for making chicken soup alot but noticed that it also does n't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken i like to be extra careful so the next set i get i 'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from henckels this time	20
0	i received my bowls today and was very disappointed how bowls this size can be referred to as mixing bowls i cannot fathom neither do i know what could be mixed in bowls so small the second from the largest bowl is about the size of a normal cereal bowl the bowls nest so the largest bowl holds the cereal bowl and the next to the smallest bowl nests in the cereal bowl the smallest bowl is a joke i doubt it would hold an extra large egg without running over the material is nice melamine and colorful but those are the only positive statements i can make	20
0	the humidifier started leaking after a few weeks in another website a few reviewers also had this problem the water overflows from the reservoir to the unit and onto the floor and does not stop until the tank is empty very annoying ! ! the filter has not lasted long and started smelly funky the third day of use it is also way too expensive	20
0	although i have used this model before and have all good results the one i bought for christmas did not work jura capresso states that they test their machines before they leave the factory they might have tested mine and it may have worked but all it did for me was spit out hot water underneath the tray i tried different grind settings but to no avail water flowing out the bottom of the machine too bad as this was a gift for all of my family imagine the look on their faces when all they got was water dripping onto the floor	20
0	this steamer performs very poorly the wrinkles in my shirts just laughed when they saw it coming now it sits in my closet collecting wasting space	20
0	the design is great the function is not always difficult to get both in the same package ! i'm going to return it it toasts unevenly toast is not crisp it burns a corner of the toast	20
0	why do they call it a 3 cup press i barely get one cup out of it ! ! are they talking expresso cups \? well anyway every single time i use it i get grounds in my cup ! everytime ! grounds ! ! ! ! yuck ! this is the third french press i have owned and it is the worst of the three ! i guess i will continue my search for a fourth french press before i choke on too many grounds ! ! ! !	20
0	first i liked this press good coffee reasonable price but in 3 weeks operation the press itself has already broken the plastic holder for mesh filter has broken may be this pres is good for ones a year usage but not for everyday	20
0	product was fine except that it is n't microwaveable at the time of purchase it claimed to be microwaveable the handle has a screw in it i purchased it specifically for use in a microwave	20
0	the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep this defect in the design which uses sections instead of one long pole makes it impossible to use without aggravation we have put tape around the pole but it does not work now we are going to try screws to hold it together i never saw anything like this in my life and hope i never do again	20
0	i was looking for a set of steak knives and came across the infomercial one night it sounded great and much cheaper then the henckels of the world and look at all the different types of knives not worth it these knives do n't cut well at all \( as compared to my henckel knife \) i wish i did n't buy it and just purchased a couple of good quality knives also the block holder is huge ! it takes up too much space	20
0	the original filter that came with the unit worked fine and it was easily able to humidify two large rooms this replacement filter however does not seem to wick water very well it can barely keep a 17x12' room at 30 humidity with the door closed windows shut and heat turned off and it 's in the 40s not even very cold out in fact it wicks so badly that for the water level to change in the tank i have to flip the filter every hour or so i called hamilton beach but they said it was n't their problem because the filters are manufactured by 3m of course this is the only filter offered for use with this unit	20
0	we made two batches of iced tea in our maker we couldn't figure out why it was leaking but figured most of them do have spout problems my husband found a crack from the spout upward so out it went although the instructions say to adjust the spout we never touched it	20
0	we finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives the name wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them they work well until they started getting dull sooner then i thought they would i have numerous sharpening stone \( ceramic diamond \) and buffing wheels and sharpened them myself to a razors edge again they worked well but soon became very dull we were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance they are well balanced looked well made but are over rated and priced the 2 mac japanese knives we have stay sharper longer take abuse better and sharpen easier	20
0	i bought this screen and hoped it would keep the stove top clean whilst i sauteed or fried food i used it twice and it worked well the third time i placed it on top of my cast iron skillet where the hamburgers were grilling and the screen caught fire at the edge it was a small fire but big enough to burn a hole thru the screen and i no longer want to use it and take a chance of another fire think twice before buying thi	20
0	i loved these sheets when i first got them they look expensive and have a nice thick feel to them after laundering them in cold water by themselves once a week for 2 months they started to fade and worse yet started developing spots of discoloration in a bright orange color on the pillowcases ! i have laundered these in tide with no bleach ! what a shame they did not hold up well	20
0	just got the pressure cooker and it looks like a great heavy duty pot very nice because of the other reviews my main purpose in purchasing this was for canning however after reading the manual i learned that this can not be used at altitudes above 3 000 feet which leaves out a lot of colorado new mexico utah otherwise i'm sure it 's great	20
0	the pin is not properly secured to the body of the pitter after a few uses it will pop off i 've gone through three of these pitters from my local linens 'n things how could the designers be so inept	20

0	the outside ring works well but the inside ring leaves an incomplete cut it appears that the two rings are not at the same level leaving no way that the inside ring can make contact with the cutting surface i am cutting the inside ring with a separate modified piece of metal	20
0	you may as well put your betta in a glass of water the argument is that bettas are naturally found in rice paddies in thailand go ahead and google images of a rice paddy bettas can live in small areas due to a special lung that lets them breathe air directly humans can live in cars but should they \? and the tiny stick of bamboo is a joke adding insult to injury they have nothing to retreat or hide behind at all in this kit bettas were not put on this earth to make your office pretty if you want a betta get them a proper tank	20
0	this was a seventh anniversaty gift and being made of copper is its only real benefit two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it 's light and relatively shabby in construction it 's difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper and to that end this fit the bill but its real value even for the intended purpose is very limited	20
0	same problem the surface has begun to deteriorate we use this pan daily always using appropriate implements and washing by hand but still the non stick surface has broken down i am going to contact all clad to see if they will stand by their product and replace	20
0	i purchased this fry pan in june of this year and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of december 1st i would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from all clad but the sad truth is that i have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer and a small fraction of the cost after just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food ick ! i love the uncoated all clad but i will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future	20
0	i have used this vacuum for over a year now i consistently have trouble with the belts staying on i cannot count the number of times i 've had to unscrew the plate underneath and reattach the belts if it even rolls over something uneven on the floor the belt comes off and the beater brush stops moving also although bagless sounded great this vacuum is very very messy to clean out i have to take it outdoors and the dust goes everywhere it also does not have a lot of sucking power through the attachments i write this review today because the beater bar stopped turning and all belts are attached i have taken this vacuum apart for the last time	20
0	worked fine for about 6 months and then the inner surface failed i'm not sure precisely what happened but some part of the surface coating wore off and now it 's impossible to make a waffle that does n't stick completely to the waffle iron a complete waste of money	20
0	my husband brought home this neat black coffee maker deliberately choosing one without a timer the less bells and whistles the less can go wrong right \? how can this company not even get the on off button right \? \? \? it 's so cheap when you push it the lighted button just pushes right in and does n't turn the coffeemaker off or on why did n't we keep the box and receipt so we could return it \? \? 20 down the draindon't buy this	20
0	do not buy this product or any other product with the perfect pour carafe the brilliant designers at black decker thought that they would improve on a centuries old design by incorporating a plastic spout on the glass carafe the problem is that the coffee flows in between the two and on to the floor or whatever else you are pouring over nice work guys one call to their customer service line was cut off on the next i chose the option to leave a message and be called back unfortunately the mailbox was full i guess the poor product deserves poor customer service	20
0	do n't buy this fan unless you can put up with noise it will make on high speed also if it has green lights \( like my blizzard fan did \) it will light up a dark room at night also you will see the fan shadow on your ceiling low speed is quiet enough for sleeping but high will disturb you the angle tilt adjustments are not precise and are difficult to do there are better choices	20
0	the unit has nice large digits but the wireless sensors do n't work consistantly the system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down we have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re established	20
0	this is the worst pan i have ever had we love mini muffins and have had wilton and other pans they are hard to clean so i thought i would buy this one and cleaning would be a snap 1st the silicone smell was horrible 2nd the pan warped in oven i used the sled it came with and followed directions3rd i washed in hot soapy water 3 times and still muffin residue4th the muffins did not come out i used spray i waited until cool and still they stuck i will never buy silicone anything do n't waiste your money	20
0	being lost without a timer for everything ! i purchased this to replace one that jumped into the dishpan having a clock and the ability to time three events at once are great features but the alarm is too soft i have hearing problems but even at a distance to 12 15 inches the alarm is easy to miss even my sharp eared children agree i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing a lesson learned for me	20
0	reasons 1 faulty battery cover design the battery cover comes off time i remove the timer from a metal surface 2 the protective glass is cloudy making the timer numbers hard to see 3 the alarms are not very audible 4 the magnet unglued itself within the first three days of use	20
0	first item came with the lcd display scratched under the protective film from the factory yes from the factory put a battery and it ran for exactly 15 seconds and died tried a new battery different brand etc yup dead do n't buy this thing i 've never seen worse quality in my life	20
0	the temperature settings for the alarm are preset and cannot be manually changed so if you cook your food using the alarm you can over cook it horribly over cook it or turn it into a cinder	20
0	it was kinda hard to use and after about 6 months it just stopped even though i always kept it charged since this is the type of product youmight take camping i do n't recommend it because it 's not reliable i used it once or sometimes twice a day no more so i really thinkit should have lasted longer	20
0	the only european characteristic of this cup is it 's price the picture is deceiving this thing is tiny i could only put three of my fingers through it 's ear i am definitely returning it to amazon in my mind it 's worth 5 bucks and is more of a for a kid than an adult	20
0	the rubbermaid chrome dish drainer arrived in a timely fashion however the utensil holder was not included i promptly contacted the seller by email their representative apologized profusely in her response and assured me that the utensil holder would arrive promptly two weeks later i did not have a utensil holder and i had received no further communication from the company i plan to return the item and dispute the charge on my credit card i also have found the same item under a different brand name for a cheaper price at bed bath and beyond	20
0	it makes great tea but the pitchers last about 4 to 6 months before the seam on the front cracks and starts to leak it would be great if a quality replacement pitcher was available then i would give it 5 stars	20
0	i know this is supposed to be a waterproof thermometer but my wife ran it under the faucet to clean it and the screen fogged up inside i took out the battery and found water in the compartment i give it as many as two stars because until the water got in it did work as advertised and seeing that other people have had no problem with the waterproofing i'm wondering if i just had a bad o ring now i'm off to find a better thermometer	20
0	i hated these shakers i got them as a gift and 1 they are too big and take up too much space and 2 the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3 the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out the other smaller fiesta ware ones the round ones are much much better	20
0	not functional bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it impossible to use the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly also it came in a box that was damaged and taped together \( not the shipping box the polder box that the product comes in \) looks like someone returned it previously \( probably for the same reasons \) and it was then sent to me i still have it because i was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted time to throw it out waste of money	20
0	i have owned a roomba for several years and have been very pleased with its performance so i was very excited to purchase the scooba however it has been the worst purchase that i ever made the first one that i received would quit working every time it bumped into furniture or the wall irobt did send a replacement but it only works about half of the time the other half of the time it does not vacuum up the dirty water so it leaves the floor dirtier than before i cleaned it i have contacted irobot for help but none of their suggestions have worked honestly i would throw it in the trash if it did not cost so much	20
0	i only used the cup 4 times before my trying to get the lid back on \( not exactly easy because of push on design versus screw on \) caused the inner lid seal to break the lid is now worthless and needs to be replaced now i have to deal with seeing if amazon will help me replace the unit even though i already sent the packaging to the recycler a week or so ago i would not recommend anyone purchasing this unit due to the lid issue and other points made in the other comments herein	20
0	i have nice sharp blades i sliced veggies and got all these tiny little plastic hairs that the cutting mat gave off as i sliced it up along with my veggies had to toss them these mats are fine if you want to use them to knead dough or any other purpose other than for what they are made for chopping and slicing with knives or other sharp objects for the price it was worth testing them out	20
0	when i opened the product the sheets really were soft but when you 're laying on them they are n't very comfortable i would n't buy another set again but they were cheap so not a horrible buy	20
0	i knew when i purchased these sheets for only 13 dollars they were n't going to be great but really these are ridiculous they are incredibly thin sheets and they pill easily they also do not stay on my mattress i am constantly having to put them back on i will not purchase these sheets again	20
0	not the best sheet experience my legs broke out in a rash best to wash before using i guess the thread count is a bit lacking too for microfiber sheets i want a cloud like surface i will go for a higher priced item next time	20
0	i purchased the f69204 for 150 on sale used once that year with good results it was another year before i tried to use again shortly after starting the motor it froze up and quit on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed the parts book said you could order the motor alone but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of 90 plus shipping in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail	20
0	hoover has a known problem with the belts stretching out on all the self propelled vacuums but wil do nothing for customers stuck with them ! we must replace the drive and propel belts every couple of months rediculous poor customer servic	20
0	saw the other review and had to share my similar experience the glue is still not off of my pan after hours and hours of scrubbing it 's now spread out a bit into a larger dark grey spot surrounded by steel wool scrapings i have to return it because i know will get angry every time i pull it out of the cupboard and see the mess	20
0	the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan think twice before you purchase this pan	20
0	after just 7 months so be aware that you might buy into some hassle by exchanging the knifes with henckels i am very dissappointed and will not spend that much money \( 80 \) on knifes ever again at least not on henckels my k mart knifes hold up better	20
0	people cliam this fan is quiet it 's not quiet i wanted a fan that will circulate the bedroom air during the night it 's too loud and keeps me awake	20
0	we bought this krups flf2 j4 with anticipation of and excelent machine for our needs it is a nice looking unit light weight and fast at heating a full load of water however an odor is created in the unit and after two weeks of usage it still remains it had n't diminished during that time it smells like burnt plastic and it transfers that to the water for our tea or fresh ground coffee not pleasant we felt it just was n't safe i 've repacked it and will return it if possible krups know of this as they mentioned it in their manual	20
0	i have used a lightweight hoover for years and was very pleased with it when i first received this new cleaner i was really excited with the power it had the third time i used it the belt broke with each use my back would start hurting the forward motion was very easy but pulling it back was hard i returned this product because i felt there was something wrong with it	20
0	i bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and did n't lit on i did n't matter because they look beautiful underwater one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too i replaced the beams but they stop working days later it 's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium \( unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks \)	20
0	we ordered 2 of these wafflemakers one for a present for my daughter in college it never worked from day one the second one worked for 2 months then quit heating up calls to villaware company resulted in them telling us to ship them back shipping costs would have been above 30 00 then what if new ones do n't work do i pay to ship those back too \? do n't waste your money on these yes when they work they make great waffles but only when they work	20
0	i bought this belgiam waffle maker 30 days ago it worked fine for 30 days and then the iron stopped heating up i contacted villaware and they suggested getting amazon com to replace the unit which they did time will tell on the replacement	20
0	i got these sheets and was very pleased with them at first after a couple of days i observed color sticking to everything around the worst it painted my matress in red color ! ! i tried my best to remove the color but it wont go away now i found the best place for these sheets in the attic	20
0	these are more like 200 250 thread count soft at first but after a couple of washings they feel rough loose their shape and wrinkle easily i purchased several different colors in twin and king sizes and all have been a disappointment	20
0	okay there 's something wrong with brita filters they do n't always fit into the pitchers when i tilt the pitcher i can hear the filter shifting inside and yes i am aligning it properly it may filter out impurities contained in the tap water but only to replace them with thick black carbon particles i 've followed all the instructions and replace the filters every second month but darned if there is n't a problem with every single one ! do n't buy this look for another alternative	20
0	i ordered this product based on the reviews that were available at the time i was sorely disappointed there is no measuring cup so all water amounts must be estimated \( the unit has three lines to help but nothing that denotes how much water to use if you wish to cook a specific number of eggs \) there is no buzzer when the unit is finished so unless you babysit it everything ends up overcooking this is a great unit to avoid purchasing unless you plan to always cook 8 eggs at a time and want them all hardboiled	20
0	i returned eureka 437az back to amazon i was very dissapointed when i 've tried to vacuum my room the vacuum is powerful but flow of air comming from the front blower is so strong that it disperses dust all over and prevents proper vacuuming in the cosumers report eureka 431 green vacuum cleaner is not recommended model and now i know that these two vacuums are practically identical the only difference being color and hepa filter another downside of this vacuum is that the dust acumulates over the filter which then is difficult to clean	20
0	my pump just up and quit after several years and it did n't always work great but when it did it was ideal so i 'll replace it but with some other product not the cuisipro again	20
0	my last one \( same model \) was good this one the auto shut off just buzzes and does n't shut off	20
0	a couple of days ago i depressed the switch to begin toasting a piece of sliced bread when all at once a blue flash jumped out at me thus causing the demise of my applicance i now realize i paid far too much for this unsafe piece of junk that lasted about two weeks short of a year	20
0	my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors i had the same problem as other reviewers the water tank kept leaking so off to the returns department we went i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked \? not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it	20
0	drip drip drip one drip at a time it takes 20 minutes to fill a pasta pot we 've had it 3 years \( it never worked any faster than this \) and sometimes i'm just tempted to just use the tap water and not worry about lead poisoning from the pipes	20
0	i have sold a number of this style timer made by kitchenaid in pink black and white almost every buyer complained all complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room have a fan on or are listening to the tv or radio replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either if you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the red black blue white or tangerine ones that are entitled digital timer with rotating dial no one has any complaints over this style of kitchenaid timers	20
0	just recently purchased the thermometer and the clip does not hold the theremometer in place paid 6 50 for item and 6 34 for shipping and was very displeased upset with quality of the item i thought the clip would hold the thermometer in the upright position so you could move the frothing cup in circular motion thermometer falls over due to clip not tight enough on thermometer shaft	20
0	it did the job til it became defective after a year of light use \( avg 3 times a week \) three of the most important buttons stopped working the start button power level button and minute plus button now the only way we can get it to heat anything is to use the popcorn button	20
0	had somewhat higher expectations given that this was a lennox got the shaker home tried it out it leaks no matter how hard you hold the darn thing together it leaks i am a materials engineer so i gave the product a more than cursory examination very very poor quality also made in china \( if that has anything to do with quality hint hint wink wink \) do not buy	20
0	thank gawd i did n't purchase this product ! my landlord has it in my apartment and i have to hang dry everything because it does n't dry clothes at all ! ! sometimes it does n't even wash ! go to sears and do proper research on a washing machine !	20
0	worked just fine for over a year then started behaving very oddly among the various problems this tob 30bc unit exhibited the most dangerous was switching itself on even when the main control was set to off not switching itself off at the end of a toasting cycle sending alarms when switched off not being able to switch the unit off ! this unit neds to be unplugged from the outlet and i consider it to be a fire hazard repeated communications to cuisinart remain unanswered	20
0	i really made a mistake and bought 2 sets thinking i could always have extras ready i tried all types of grinds i packed loosely i packed firmly i packed tight i played and played still did not get a good cup of coffee finally threw them out just taking up space learned a lesson on buying quantity	20
0	i purchased this blanket for 30 from amazon after reading the same reviews i see now the negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after i saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than i expected from the review the real issue is that the quality is very poor i returned it and got a 30 blanket from target and found the quality much better luxuious egyption cotton no way	20
0	the decanter 's pretty the wine topper is okay however the picture is misleading these two items are clearly not meant to be paired the topper does not fit must have been very carefully balanced for the photo but it sure wo n't stay that way the topper is made for a bottled wine not a decanter	20
0	my girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon this is by visiondecor furniture first it shows up on the curbside in pieces did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together \? this is not including the cushions the material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy i do n't know if it will last a year ikea furniture is actually better quality paid around 550 with shipping if she would have spent another 200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in los angeles she is very disappointed and wants to cry sad very sad	20
0	seriously for as good as their mixers are their knives are really really disappointing flimsy dull easily bent and broken within the first week of use our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later the steak knives are now following suit and the handle of the chef 's knife has completely seperated from the blade gah ! do n't waste your money	20
0	we ordered an 8 inch quiche pan when it arrived the nordic 8 inch pan turned out to be 9 inches a 9 inch quiche pan can be bought at any local store i went on line to find a hard to locate item and when i ordered this item it was not in stock so i waited almost a month for delivery and it is not as described i was deceived by the web advertisement unfortunately amazon hides the merchants name in the billing arrangement so i cannot review the merchant	20

0	i ordered this item and received several notices postponing its delivery eventually i cancelled my order because more than a month has gone by and still no table and chairs	20
0	this is not and i repeat is not a good alarm there is one alarm light and you can hardly tell which one is sounding it looks as if the specs are lying to me and i hate lies also the battery died after 6 8 months the low battery alert is loud and chirps so anoyingly i also noticed that the alarm sounds a loud shrieking alarm when it sounds i will return this alarm never again will i trust in first alert	20
0	this is a hollow ground blade \( not flat ground \) which does not cut straight the blade tends to want to rotate in the cut because of this get a knife with a flat ground blade not this one you can see the ground part at the bottom of the blade it is a cheaper way to make knives	20
0	i returned this absolutely unusable could not keep bottle engaged while pulling down the two rather unforgiving arms	20
0	this is a very nice and soft blanket the best out of all electric blanket however i have to return 2x due to the malfunction controller after only 2 weeks of usage one of the controller started blinking e and no heat at all same problems twice ! i ca n't recommend this item until the problem is fixed	20
0	i received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed it is just not warm enough ! ! even on the highest setting it does n't get warm enough initially it is fine for keeping warm during the night but i want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does it is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well not worth the money at all	20
0	this electric blanket has the nicest texture of the last five electric blankets we have purchased however it stopped working within a month like the other four who makes a realiable electric blanket \? not sunbeam and not this brand since the texture on this one is nice we can at least keep it as an extra cuddling blanket	20
0	i ca n't figure out what is so special about this rice cookerso i am irritated by the price which is making me wonder iftheir whole product line is over priced	20
0	it amazes me that this model is being sold here since the product was recalled by the manufacturer a newer safer model is offered for just 10 more by vornado do your homework before you buy	20
0	i was very disappointed with this cheese slicer the wire broke after about the fourth use i have always had good experiences with oxo and was very surprised	20

0	please do not buy they do not packge the refigerator right it comes with dents and parts are missing ! ! ! ! ! !	20
0	was happy with this toaster until i had it for about 4 months at that time the lever started acting up by not staying down sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down not what i expect from a 70 toaster well i have finally given up \( 2 months later \) and am sending it back to hamilton beach since too much time has passed to send it to amazon they are sending me a new one which i am not sure i am happy about might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster oven	20
0	i had my first machine for 5 months a gift from a friend when it started to let steam out all over the place i went out and bought another one i thought i was just unlucky with the first one it also only lasted 5 months like the first one i cleaned it vinegar etc like the instructions said no luck steam came from everywhere it would not warm the milk anymore i took it back never again	20
0	do not buy this the steamer stops working in a month and it cannot be fixed cleaning does n't help at all even after carefully following the instructions very cheap no good	20
0	as a starbucks employee of almost 2 years at my college i know how to brew espresso and properly make drinks my roommates got this for me as a christmas present at the field days sale so i could make coffee drinks for all of our late night study sessions after about 2 months of use the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead i contacted a service advisor at krups' website and it turns out that i would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in illinois on my own dime no thank you ! i 'll find something better	20
0	functionally this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner it is not attractive to look at however my walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish the varnish is very high gloss and the knobs are low grade mismatched junk i believe the build is solid but only time will tell final word pay the extra money for a hand crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally this just is n't worth 300	20
0	i too received this item with chipped corners scratches and broken pieces unfortunately the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it so we 'll have to live with the damage it 's a nice looking desk otherwise but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time	20
0	check out kmart com they have the samething for 39 99 a 20 savings	20
0	i ordered some replacement batteries and was told that they would be here last wednesday it is now thursday of the next week i have emailed them and told them to email me or call me to let me know where my package is and to no affail no call i will never order from petsafe again ! !	20
0	i do not think that the batteries were fresh doesn't seem to bother my dog when he barks	20
0	i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i 'd kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them are n't great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they 're pretty but not very functional	20
0	saw these canisters and fell in love with them could n't wait to get them and when i did they were broken into a million pieces they replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal does n't fit properly another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off i was disppointed in the quality i would n't buy these again even if i had to buy something more expensive	20
0	i bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6 10 times over the course of 13 months it stopped working i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it ca n't be repaired i should just throw it away ! i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless ! buy one at you own risk	20
0	this as a new and improved zyliss press it does not come with the plastic cleaner the older model used because it has a nonstick surface it is very difficult to remove the peels left after pressing the holes have to be cleaned individually with a small probe like a toothpick difficult and time consuming i have sent multiple e mails to zyliss asking for cleaning suggestions zyliss does not respond the companies lack of interest in customer satisfaction is very informative do n't buy their products	20
0	we purchased the delonghi based on its ease of cleaning \( 4 of 5 parts can be placed in the dishwasher \) after the third use the plastic part that holds the heating element in place melted off the base delonghi service was apologetic and promised to send a replacement part asap although the part was out of stock that was in september almost 6 months ago parts are still backordered ! i returned the unit to lowes in frustration got a new unit and it too melted on the first use returned it for credit do not consider this unit	20
0	after reading countless poor reviews of the dolce desk and hutch i was quite skeptical about ordering it online i gave in and ordered the set from target com the desk arrived in almost perfect condition \( a few smudges in the stain \) however only half the hutch was in its box ! the entire drawer \( left side of hutch \) was missing the hardware was missing and the assembly instructions were missing i recommend calling your local target store to check the dolce collection 's availability \( and the parts inside ! \) before you waste the time and gas to get there aside from the missing hutch the desk looks really great in my home office	20
0	these covers are not even close to being red the are wine or burgundy in color	20
0	this pet chime was a good idea but i am sending it back sometimes the chime wo n't ring and at other times it rings on its own and worst of all it starts ringing and wo n't stop clearly the manufacturer needs to work on quality control	20
0	it stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out according to sanyo will cost more to fix than i paid while it lasted it worked fine	20
0	the high tech commercial cooking surface began to come off at the third use of this griddle i do n't know what evenheat means in their product description but this griddle has a hot spot on the left side i'm in the market for a new griddle but i wo n't buy anything labeled broilking again	20
0	i was excited about getting a cute timer that worked with the decor of my kitchen unfortunately the timer never worked on the product ! now i am sad	20
0	i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it ! it ticks but the bell does n't ring at the end also i was disappointed in it 's packaging as well as the item itself it does not look upscale the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item look elsewhere !	20
0	was very disappointed in this comforter while it is heavy like i had anticipated it is not soft in any way shape or form it is like newspaper it crackles on the bed and makes noise all night long	20
0	i bought this griddle under the impression that it was non stick it is everything but that i only cook with butter \( no sprays \) but that does not matter even with butter the eggs stick every time even pancakes stick this is the worst grill i have ever used	20
0	the larger of the bowls was broken when i recieved it so it was not packet very well i have used the smaller bowl and loved it	20
0	after a couple months the humidity became stuck at 20 even holding it by my humidifier did n't help	20
0	i also have this fountian in black i get a orange slime on my filter and the white residue on the slide part i agree it is hard to tell if the fountain is dirty the filters do not seem to last very long either i have not even owned this for a year and the motor has broke now i am attempting to find a motor to replace this one i do not reccommend this color at all ! the fountian has been fine until now but it should n't of broke down already	20
0	petmate makes a great fountain but their black model should be discontinued it is impossible to tell if the water is clean by looking at it when i went to wash this fountain like i usually do every couple of weeks there was a purplish color slim growing by the pump and the charcoal filter was covered with it i think the pump motor might have been leaking \( i'm not really sure \) if i had their white fountain i would have noticed there was a problem with the water right away	20
0	it is soft and feels sooooo good ! ! ! but the burgundy sheeds like a cat it is all over the floor my hair the red fur is every were ! ! ! i only get one pillow cast and one sheet like thing ! ! ! i have 2 \( two \) pillows please ! in the photo it looks like two of every thing ! ! help me here ! ! where is the other one \?	20
0	the skinny grill satin black came in chestnut brown and brokken to pieces still waiting for some relief in terms of a credit i feel like the guilty party even though all i did was give them my hard earned money and trust that they would deliver a product to me so far computer form replys !	20
0	i wanted a humidifier that was silent but when i plugged this in not only could i hear it from the other room but it 's a high pitched whine i do n't know what to do about it i think i 'll probably just return it for something different	20
0	the add said it would seperate small berry seeds the holes on the smallest grate are about 1 8 you could fit 20 seed through one of them very disappointing	20
0	when i bought these pads at amazon last year a 50 pack was 11 99 now its 26 99 ! does anyone know why this happened \? the pads themselves are fine and work beautifully with the pad holder but i'm protesting against this price	20
0	nice looking but not easy to move the bar at the top is n't smooth and it hurts if you try to move the stool with one hand also it arrived with the top plastic piece broken on one side disappointed not worth the trouble of returning	20
0	i have two great danes who love chew treat toys especially kong i brought the everlasting treat balls home and they both were able to pop out the treat within 2 minutes ! they enjoyed the treats but the expensive plastic ball is useless i will be returning this product tomorrow	20
0	first the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner that can be overlooked but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability i may have just as well bought a blade grinder in that the grind was dust and chunks no matter what setting i put it on horrible to say the least i sent it back and purchased a new one which i enjoy to this day	20
0	the unit is hefty and nice looking but that is about all nice i can say about it the grind was no better than from the 20 burr mill it was replacing on the third use the motor burned up i also had problems with it making a mess when removing the jar such a defect should never have left the factory since it is so obvious	20
0	i liked the price and all the different stitches however i needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things such as alterations and heavy sewing i'm very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine the needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread also the food feed stalls jerks and surges this machine has beautiful stitches but is for lightweight sewing only	20
0	i like this type of opener very much and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing so i opened the package and tried to open a bottle of wine but the corkscrew would not lock i'm not even sure i 'll send it back given the warranty hassle shipping costs etc given the price i just ca n't recommend this brand to anyone	20
0	i bought this particular lever corkscrew because i read a very favorable review in consumer reports it is all metal which is necessary because the lever action actually puts a lot of stress on the gears the guide and the frame after about 50 bottles the pin in the guide started wearing and the screw no longer entered the cork along the axis of the device making it harder and harder to use i actually fixed this a couple of times but then the frame actually broke at its thinnest point end of story	20
0	i bought the four pack of these pillows and kept finding the pillows thrown in other rooms my husband informed me that he hates the pillows they are not soft and are crunchy and loud when you lie on them	20
0	after i read stories about problems chlorine causes in the shower chlorine i got this filter it turns out most water systems are using chloramine now a more stable additive instead of chlorine and this filter like most is ineffective at removing chloramine see if your water system uses chloramine and save yourself an expensive filter that probably does n't work	20
0	i had this vacuum for about a month the suction was so bad that after every room i had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction i hated it ! not only that but the bagless was a pain ! i had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy ! not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever it made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in ! i did not want that in my house ! i absolutely hated this vacuum	20
0	this canister vac might be ok for very light duty but do n't expect it to handle any real housecleaning the filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot if i had it to do over again i would not purchase this vac i would save up and buy a better canister vacuum	20
0	i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it i was so disappointed with the quality of the product the sheets are extremely rough thin and scratchy the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it 's trademark as such i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding	20
0	i often have to mix by hand things always end up dry and grainy might be partially my fault maybe i should try adding the ingredients as it 's mixing it makes a really huge mess my mother and i both bought one but i told her to return hers it was n't worth it	20
0	the hoover floormate was great the first two times we used it along with the old english it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution after using it twice it had difficulty dispensing solution from the reservoir this was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly it still got the job done not too long after that it would n't vacuum the solution back into the unit i got a great clean for the price divided by four uses you do the math i 'll stick to the cheap clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after i put the floor ex mate into the trash very disappointe	20
0	i would rate this item 0 star but it is not an option there are too many styles models it is very confusing check item specifics carefully to avoid getting the wrong style model this vacuum has stationary brushes save your money and pay the difference for the models w spin scrub	20
0	i was pleased with the way the hoover cleaned my floors except that i had to empty the containers too many times after using it for 3 or 4 weeks i realized that it is scratching and scuffing the floors and they look terrible i hope i can return it because i can no longer use it terry sit	20
0	still can't figure out what this scissor cuts it surely is not poultry or meat or fish i will have to try it on paper but then i didn't need another paper scissor ! ! ! ! !	20
0	i'm terribly disappointed the feed chute is tiny \( barely big enough for two fingers \) the tray above the chute does n't hold anything \( most things fall out \) clean up is a nightmare and it takes forever to get a usable glass of juice stick with a centrifugal juicer like the breville elite 800 unless you enjoy torturing yourself	20
0	yes watch out pls always try to read review before buying its true the picture is deceiving but what i do n't understand is why amazon keep using this picture	20
0	had this grinder for 8 months two large cracks have formed in the side of the unit now they are widening and trapping lots of coffee grounds i'm tossing it and getting a different brand all form no function	20
0	i found at a housewares store \( bed bath amp beyond or the like \) a shot glass with several different units of measurement fluid ounces teaspoons tablespoons \( in half tablespoon increments \) and ml 's much more useful than this product especially if you 're measuring for weight loss purposes and can have exactly two and a half tablespoons of that salad dressing	20
0	i just threw this item away after finding the filter clogged with hairy dirty black and green mold again ! i changed the little bulb that is supposed to prevent mold and the filter often each time i changed the filter i found it clogged with mold ! i have never had a problem with mold with any of the warm mist humidifiers i have used for years this was just plain awful	20
0	this thing worked like a champ impressed friends and lasted all of 6 months and then the plastic screw that attaches the handle to the grating drum snapped cheap cheap cheap ! and at 20 per definately not considered disposable ! look elsewhere the zyliss will be my next purchase and i will leave feedback	20
0	bought this at target returned it the next day not even close to the quality of b d t r o 's from even a few years ago summed up in one word 'cheesy' is the appropriate descriptor	20
0	i'm sending it back immediately no where in the description of the product did it say it was plastic and i do n't feel i should be charged for return postage	20
0	i tried this thermal coffee press delighted to see it was 1 2 the price of other thermal coffee presses but in this instant you get what you pay for 1 \) the coffee does n't stay as hot as a regular thermos 2 \) when you press the grains down to the bottom they leak back up into the thermos and your last cup of coffee looks and taste like mud 3 \) its these times that you wish you bought the item in the store because now i have to pack it back in its box and send it back	20
0	i bought this toaster and a b d coffeemaker \( that 's no longer available because it sucked ! \) on the same day back in december 2005 they both died a week apart the toaster giving up the ghost just this morning when the slide would no longer stay down maybe b d makes nice power tools but they 're batting a big zero with me in the kitchen small appliance department	20
0	thinking this would be an excellent gift for mr electronics geek light sleeper it became a pretty big joke \( and embarassment for me \) because some of the sounds that come out of this thing sound like a circus or a dying speak n' spell do n't bother buy the sound screens used in medical offices etc for half the price they 're so much better	20
0	we got this for our new baby we loved it until tonight it just up and died and i 've only had it 19 days taking it back tomorrow	20
0	this dispenser has a strong resistance and makes it difficult to pull back the lever with the thumb when it closes it tends to leave behind a drop of syrup that can run down the side	20
0	just purchased this toaster and it is being sent back even on maximum setting it hardly toasts we tried different breads different settings and it just does n't work right we even tried toasting \( on maximum \) one lot of bread \( not good \) and followed it by another lot of bread \( better but not adequate \) on the theory that it was warmed up after the first lot of bread forget it on the up side the toaster looks good but for 80 it should toast better than my old 9 99 black and decker ! !	20
0	the packaging had n't been so pathetic the tiny pieces of styrofoam that failed to cushion the fridge during shipping led to a fridge that arrived leaking coolant the cooling part of the unit had come dislodged from the frame and one of the pipes was broken and leaking plus there was no crisper drawer included i wo n't be buying a replacement from sanyo ! !	20
0	i paid too much money for this tea kettle to drip from under the spout and spit water all over the stove before it even whistles this is a disappointment ! save your money and search for a better kettle this one is n't a good buy or a good produc	20
0	i ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up big people food for my grandson it could not even grind up a soft hot dog ! we kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material \( painted gray to look like metal ! \) it just could n't do the job sheesh i mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder total waste of money also my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two junk	20
0	coffeemaker just quit yesterday makes cold coffee now unable too use got a three year warranty and lasted three months biggest waste of money yet now call customer service get a busy signal last 15 minutes never buy another hamilton beach product	20
0	my lab mix had the rope detached from the tennis ball material in less than 20 minutes in the same time she 'd broken some of the individual strands of the nylon rope so if one thing had n't broken something else would have not durable not recommended	20
0	we ordered this for a spare fridge and it would be a great size but the first on came and it was damaged it looked like it had been dropped then i called target they did great taking care of getting us another on only the second came today and it was also dropped from a truck the back was dented and it was already rusting so i think we will try some where else for this item	20
0	after about 10 days from date of purchase only 4 of the 8 cups would cycle i would have to push the on button get another 2 cups after 5 or 6 tries i would finally get all 8 cups through the design is bad for left handed people it 's very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate the lid is a bit of a struggle to screw on and i would rather have a thumb operated carafe than this screw to pour lid overall not a good design i got my money back and am bought a hamilton beach brewstation which i think is a great coffemaker	20
0	cute bookshelf looks goods and serves its purpose however the tips of it that screw together break really easily we were using it at trade shows where we put it up and took it down once a week it only lasted through 3 shows two tips snapped off the last time we unscrewed it even though we put very little weight on it when it was in use and no weight or funny angles on it when unscrewing probably would work well if you never plan to take it down but i 'd question how much weight it can hold over a long period of time	20
0	i was tired of replacing wires on myold cheese slicer every couple of years the blade bends through a block ofcheese it doesnt provide a straightcut	20
0	i used this item twice the second time i had one sweatshirt and one sweater on the rack it broke into 5 pieces ! waste of money	20
0	what a piece of crap just putting this together broke it and was missing one of the snap parts truely a waste of money	20
0	this thing basically self destructed the first week the handle pieces would n't stay together and when i pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart not worth the money ! i was very disappointed	20
0	once in a while the coffee side of the machine will spew steam out the back and i will get a half of a pot of coffee the big problem with this piece of junk that the coffee maker was under a cabinet and the steam was ruining the kitchen cabinet i say this is 199 down the drain i have never had problems with a coffee maker spitting steam out the back and no water dripping into the pot stay away from this garbage i am not even interested in contacting krups for any warranty repair because it is not worth it	20
0	searched for a long time to find a good quality espresso machine that did n't cost over 500 we had a great workhorse krups combo espresso coffee machine that was still working after 15 years was hoping this one would be the newer more powerful fancier model boy are we sorely disappointed the coffee part works fine unfortunately the espresso part leaks all over from the gasket and does n't even produce hot espresso i exchanged this once hoping i just got a bad one but apparently the krups xp2010 is designed badly shame on krups for releasing a premature untested product	20
0	the lcd display do not work right line are missing from the display	20
0	i'm not happy the filter needed changing one day out of the box we have soft water so this should have lasted a while difficult to hang on to when filling have to hold it like a baby does put out the air though and fits about anywhere	20
0	i have just used this spinner for the first time in a long while now i remember why i avoid it it is nearly impossible to get the top and spinning basket to mesh and at the same time get the top with the handle to fit onto the bottom part the very few times that all has gone together and stayed long enough to get a good grip on the bottom the greens have come out nice and dry otherwise it 's an exercise in frustration ! i hope that mine is defective or something because otherwise i must say pass this one by and find a different design or model and test it in a store before you buy it	20
0	i bought this item because other comforters from this seller had good reviews but it was a complete mistake ! it really was dingy like described by other reviewer i returned it but lost over twenty five dollars in back and forth shipping costs for this item i highly recommend against this product or seller	20
0	i really wanted this cereal dispenser to ease the morning rush unfortunetly it is just messy annoying and takes up counter space when you turn the nob it crunches the cereal and much of it flies in every direction if the cereal is too big \( honeycomb size \) it does n't come out easily if it is too small \( fruity pebbles \) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere ! i definetly would not buy this product again at one point i even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away the time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter	20
0	probably have bashed this product enough but it is insulting to still see quot sturdy lid and side handles for improved grip quot advertised in no time at all the handles broke off like peanut brittle glad i was n't carrying it around the kitchen no wonder no one carries replacement handles do n't know what 's better but sure wo n't try rival again	20
0	loses grip on can and the can slips off bad product do not buy	20
0	this product does not work the dial just moves randomly please tell me who to contact for a refund	20
0	do n't make the mistake of thinking your dog could play with this it 's to large would be great if they made it smaller for dog	20
0	i purchased a krups thermal replacement pot for an electric coffee maker about two weeks after i bought it i made coffee one morning only to discover the coffee running all over the floor for no apparent reason the glass inside of the thermal pot had completely shattered i will be returning the pot this week	20
0	i also had the surprise and joy of having my carafe 's glass lining explode the carafe had a little over 1 5 years of use and i never used any sort of abrasive on it note that for the price of this replacement carafe you could pay for most of a whole new coffee machine	20
0	i have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and i have a lot of experience peeling vegetables i am fast and have rarely cut myself however i bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago i cut myself so severly with it i thought about going to the hospital this peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others i have used and so it some how gives me an quot out of control quot feeling with each thrust it is also extra sharp i ca n't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well	20
0	i bought these candles in the store when i got home i set everything up and lit the candles in less that 30 minutes all 5 candles had burned to half way and the strings the medals are on had caught on fire too the entire thing was on fire \( a big fire \) i was able to blow it out and take it outside to the trash can i have bought target candles before and love them i am not happy ! !	20
0	if you read between the lines on the other reviews here i think you 'll see that everyone thinks this thing is junk and their right ! ! ! no matter how small the job it wo n't do it it 's just one more made in china piece of junk that i 've wasted money on it wo n't suck anything off hard wood or carpet floors i do n't get how any company let alone a well known vacuum company could sell such a usless tool my only question is how could anyone give this thing two or more stars \? \?	20
0	first off i paid 25 00 for this at walmart so i would suggest going there first if you decide you want this light weight vacuum at the time of this writing amazon is selling it for 54 00 secondly it works fine for the amt of money i spent thirdly my biggest problem is the thing is so loud that in order to use it i will have to put ear plugs in seriously this product makes about as much noise as a fire alarm ! ! i have an email in to eureka com because their 800 number did not have this vacuum as an option on their automated voice mail and i was disconnected for trying to reach a human being to speak to	20
0	the item is not packed well for shipping the drawer and top were cracked when i called the number on the replacement part i was told did not have the replacement they gave me a number to call for target they in turn told me they could n't send it and told me to call the number i had just called unreal trying to get this fixed i am going to have to pack the whole thing up and return myself no help in getting this taken care of	20
0	very hard to put together drawers came broken both times cute though not at all sturd	20
0	i dont see the point in this the mighty bright led light lasts a lifetime because it uses l e d therefore you will not need replacement besides that the product photo of this replacement bulbs show ordinary light bulps not led ! !	20
0	i was very unhappy with how the product worked it squirted all over it only made the adhesive gummy and you could smell the petroleum our waste disposal company would not even take it and i had to take it to a landfill site for them to dispose of it	20
0	people who complain that the aerosol can is empty the next day should listen closely to the product the one i ordered will leak as long as the mechanism is attached to the aerosol can i have tried reconnecting it many times using different pressure as i push down but to no avail at 10 dollars a night this product will get very expensive very quickly if it had worked without the leak i would have given ssscat 5 stars	20
0	i loved it until it broke after using it for a day now when i turn it on the sound will not turn off if it actually worked correctly i think i would have given it a better rating	20
0	the windtunnel ii is a poorly constructed vacuum it is less than six months old and the motor for the hepa filter had to be replaced it is very messy when you have to empty the tank dust and dirt collect around the hepa filter and falls down when you are emptying the tank	20
0	this is the most poorly designed machine i have ever seen it is continually clogging both filters and the hepa filter becomes filled with dirt quickly causing loss of all suction i replaced it with the dyson dc17 which is awesome do not buy this vacuum	20
0	giving 2 stars on the suction alone hepa filter does n't self clean turn after one use a lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you do n't pay very close attention to aligning it just right i really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it 's heavy and dirt just falls out a lot of dirt when emptying the dirt box i'm returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience	20
0	i bought this coffeemaker 6 weeks ago and the burner plate is pealing i also discovered after i had water and coffee grounds all over that you have to place the carafe with the handle to the side slightly or it will not drip properly hopefully i can get my money back and try another bran	20
0	before i purchased this product i read several reviews many of them very favorable this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning restoring company i recently used for my tile floors imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor and an even worse job of sucking it back up leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it i 've tried other bissel products which were fine but this one is an expensive dud do n't waste your mone	20
0	i had this blender for 3 4 years and was very unhappy with it the design is poor \( liquids tend to dribble terribly when poured \) the motor seems weak and it is hard to clean food seems to get under the metal band around the top and is not reachable today after only sporadic medium duty use over the few years i had it my blender outright died i have other cuisinart products that perform very well but this blender is a loser	20
0	looks great in my kitchen but i too only use it for shakes smoothies it does smell like burning rubber nearly every time i used to think something was wrong with it and now i just disregard it and after less than two years or making smoothies i'm replacing the blade gasket assembly	20
0	i rate this set very poor in less than six months the face cloth has holes in it the towel absorption is ok	20
0	not up to standard set by other kitchenaid pro line appliances when dessert is frozen will not dispense even with mix engaged when thawed dessert turns to near water consistancy no way to remove dessert other than through dispenser no control to modulate freezing either on or off manual setting when front comes off for cleaning retained liquid runs down the front of the machine short of the drip pan	20
0	i ordered this cereal dispenser for my adult son he filled it with raisin bran when he turned the knob to release the cereal into a bowl the flakes of cereal broke up some missed the bowl and went on the floor he 's going to try putting cheerios in it to replace the raisin bran if it does n't work well with the cheerios i plan to return the item	20
0	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out it was wonderful wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one i bought this item i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it i was suspect when i opened it poor quality material poor bed fit very very warm on the lowest setting after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires which are quite large in my ribs it had to come off i had rather be cold and i hate being cold	20
0	this product does not pick up dirt on laminate flooring at all which was not my impression when it was advertised	20
0	i would rate this zero but that option is not available the weight of the stainless steel is heavy exactly what i had expected for 18 8 however the top does not affix to the base it seems the threads inside of the top do not match with the threads on the base furthermore the pumper does not work leaving one to pour the liquid from the base that 's worse than our original situation with the unsightly bottle of liquid dishsoap on the counter yuck ! i do not recommend the purchase of this product	20
0	the sheets say they are sateen but feel more like basic cotton or flannel since i was really going for that cotton sateen feel i'm not impressed i have a queen sized bed and have not had any problems getting the sheets to fit on the bed even after washing as some other reviews stated	20
0	we received our sheet set and they felt like sateen but when we washed them they lost the sateen feel they feel like flannel we are very disappointed with our purchase	20
0	very hard to get any actual pepper to come out of this thing i just put some pepper on eggs and it took over 10 squeezes imagine trying to grind pepper out for a stock pot full of soup impossible	20
0	i bought this kettle in february 2006 i liked everything about it until its automatic on off switch died recently only two months after the purchase now the kettle wo n't turn on it was n't abused in any way and these kettles usually last for years and years the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique \? has anyone else had one with a short lived switch or was i unlucky \?	20
0	i ordered this item but the platter i received has a completely different flower pattern in blue ! i really wanted the item pictured so i'm not too happy	20
0	not worth the high price difficult to clean and very persnickety comes with a bunch of sensors that if not properly triggered keep it from roasting not long after i bought it i could n't get it to start without jamming a pencil in one spot and now it does n't work at all when it works it works fine but it does n't always work nor does it last very long	20
0	i ordered a tailchaser for my cat before and i had no problems with getting my order but not with this one its been over a month and i still havent received the 2nd one i ordered ! i will never order from them again	20
0	i ordered the 5 piece ble set on march 18th and still have n't received this i keep on getting an email that it is on back order and i now wo n't get it until june 30th costumer service is ridiculous i was told it would take 3 5 days that 's why i ordered it don't get it if you need it within one yea	20
0	the can opener does not swing tight and once installed kept swinging out instead of staying stowed i bought it because it was so highly rated but i am very disappointed there is no magnet to hold the can lid either although it was intended to save space it is kind of a clunky eyesore	20
0	read the info about this product carefully this listing is not for kitchen scissors but rather poultry shears chef 's choice does make the 8 kitchen scissors in the picture but that is not what you will get if you order these i had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas i am now returning the poultry shears to amazon	20
0	i really loved the look of the lamp and it went perfectly in my living room for a reading light next to my favorite chair two days after i bought it it broke at the place where it screws together on the pole i returned it and actually considered getting another one just because i liked the looks of it so well but ended up just getting a refund i was pretty disappointed and am still looking for a lamp to replace it	20
0	the detector was simple enough to use although it required alot of batteries \( 8 \) but the results were mixed urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances even in areas where i knew there had been an accident it was difficult to spot the difference all in all i generally would n't recommend this \( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom \)	20
0	these sheets feel like sandpaper they didnt fit my pillowtop either thankfully so i had to return the	20
0	while the wine pourer works as advertised i am disappointed that the company appears to have discontinued the wine stopper i was originally seeking i was after the pourer that came with a flapper at the top that acted to preserve the freshness of the wine in between tastings while the above item fits the bill as a spout i personally find it useless	20
0	the pump broke within 2 weeks and i have n't been able to find a replacement it would be under warranty but i threw away the paperwork \( my bad \) because usually i keep everything and then it just clutters up and i never have a problem however i still think the product should last a little longer than that ! i purchased mine at petsmart and we live too far away to return it although i had tossed the box etc	20
0	the sheets and comforter in this set are very scratchy and stiff and you can see right through the sheets i would not recommend the set very poor quality i do n't even use the sheets on my son 's bed because they seem so uncomfortable	20
0	after reading the reviews on this product i thought it would be a great space heater for my apt i could n't have been more wrong it barely gets hot even on the highest setting and gives off almost no heat ! ! perhaps mine is defective or got broken during shipping but it was a huge waste of money i have had to go out an buy another space heater already it is so frustrating one word do n't !	20
0	worst set of sheets i 've ever owned washed them and put them on the bed directly out of the drier the fitted sheet ripped at two different corners	20
0	the image in this product is misleading it looks like this product contains more than 1 piece but when i opened it i got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior	20
0	i 've had a lot of problems using this my sister has one and loves it ! but for me it leaks	20
0	it seemed like a great idea at the time but it does not work at all simply the grass is n't growing it only made the water in the fountain dirt	20
0	this towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric \( like dust bunnies \) formed on it too perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag but not in one 's bathroom	20
0	the product description for this is wrong ! ! there is a somewhat hidden zipper but for some inexplicable reason the lining is sewn into the cover so you ca n't separate the two	20
0	i agree with a previous review coating does not hold up comes off if bumped to hard has been used gently and the metal is already showing one thing i would like to know is what is the highest temp this coating will tolerate	20
0	as far as whisks for non stick surfaces go the silicone encased wires are very flexible a far cry from the hard thick plastic whisks with only a few wires they are ideal for non stick surfaces except for one problem the silicone is soft and not durable after a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer the silicone gets easily cut the silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose i have been very careful but this works out to probably 2 each time i used it	20
0	i rate this negative five stars i just purchased it thinking after reading all the reviews that it was great what a crock ! ! ! ! it 's absolutely worthless it does not clean the water it 's been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy the water flows and the motor is running the charcoal is in place but it does n't clean the water i'm better off with a bowl that i clean every day this thing just swishes around dirty water do n't waste your money	20
0	i bought this board along with another brand this one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink it also warped within one month of my purchasing it the wood has also splintered not my idea of a good cutting board i would not recommend it to my friends nor would i purchase it as a gift	20
0	it works fine but my cat wo n't use it i was thrilled with the reviews i read about this fountain and happily set it up as soon as it arrived unfortunately i like it better than my cat does he largely ignores it and still prefers to drink out of the bathtub or a glass oh well before you buy make sure it 's not the sound of the water that attracts your cat this fountain has no water sound \( pretty quite actually \) i think that 's why my cat ignores it	20
0	i love the sango nova brown dishware and rate it 5 stars this boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight the slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer 's comments mine too arrived broken sure seems like sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping i sure hope amazon gets credit from sango for all these broken pieces combined score 2	20
0	this came broken the packaging was not good damage good do n't make happy custome	20
0	coffee warmer only keeps coffee lukewarm so i am still in the market for a coffee warmer	20
0	you can hold this in both hands and your finger will only overlap a little 18 oz 's is a lot of water	20

0	i bought this item at my local target the weekend i moved into my new apartment the parts are quality chrome and the wood top is certainly appealing to the eye if only the pieces actually fit together to assemble a sturdy piece of furniture one of the shelves does n't fit properly over the four legs and the finished product sways at the slightest touch judging by the glowing reviews on this page at best this product is a hit or miss venture there 's a reason it 's priced at 30 dollars buyer beware	20
0	these are not what you 'd expect from wusthof the wusthof symbol on the handle is a sticker \( ! ! ! \) which bleaches out after washing also after 1 months use and washing we 're getting rust spots while these knives are sharp they are not holding up appearance wise very disappointed	20
0	this french press made a delicious cup of coffee the problem is that it is advertised as a 3 cup coffeemaker i returned it and will get a larger size	20
0	riedel 's water glass and gourmet glass are both made in france of glass \( not crystal \) the stem 's too short for wine in my opinion but you could always use them for water the water glasses are more suitable though as they have a wider mouth	20
0	although its description said it is a replacement carafe also for a different model for which i bought it it did not fit at all i felt it a nuisance to return it so i did not return it but i certainly wasted the money i paid i was very unhappy	20
0	unless you are cleaning the fishbowl this thing is useless	20
0	this item is for serving only it will not keep the liquid hot or cold more than 30 mins	20
0	i ordered the product and thought i was getting the large size i called the shipper no returned calls and i ca n't really use the item shipped as i needed the large item how do i return the shipper does n't return the calls not a happy customer of this product	20
0	the fitted twin sheet when i used in my boy bed on corner to rip is the worse material use for childrens is sandpaper the worse product the only good thing is that my little sleep better with thomas and friends i recommend thi sproduct only if your boy is not easy to put it in bed with thomas can sleep without mom or dad	20
0	i was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son but when i took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper i have washed it several times but it is still very rough also the first time i washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed it was very cheaply made but my son does love it purely because its thomas i'm sure i would n't buy this again	20
0	i was really excited to try this cage out for my 6 lb male maltese it is a perfect size and it seemed really well made my dog does n't really like cages and was able to chew right through the zipper seam he is not aggressive and does not chew things he should n't so to my surprise about a week after my husband and i bought the cage we found him out of it we were truly disappointed it is a cute cage and has a very sturdy frame if you are not planning on zippering the cage or your dog does not chew through zippered seams it is a great cage but overall i was disappointe	20
0	i used an avocado smaller than the tool so i had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it 'd fit then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell it made me realize that it 's not that hard to slice an avocado with a paring knife oh well	20
0	after about a month it started producing cool mist that smelled funny like something bad had rotted in the room the filters are a nuisance i think i'm much better off with a steam vaporizer	20
0	i'm really upset with this item i registered for it and when i got it the thing did n't work i called the 800 number trying to see if i did everything right but could n't get a live person on the phone i went and exchange the item and the second one did n't work horrible horrible product and business	20
0	we got this as a gift amp used it its loud and spits out water we 're not happy with it	20
0	this looks like a good idea from westinghouse but if you read the warranty details the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10 year warranty 10 00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years but not really \? what is the point \? extra tape is n't even included when the first strip fails i suggest you use a flashlight	20
0	omie izzy are brother sister kitties about 6 months old they received this as a gift it 's fun when someone plays with us with a chasing toy but we do n't play in it much on our own one of the wires broke already and we 've had it less than one month	20
0	i hate to rate something so low but my experience warrants a low score the larger burner was defective from the onset the knob turned but the burner remained on and at full it seemed regardless of the knob 's setting i had to unplug and plug in the unit to turn it off and on the smaller burner worked ! amazon was nice enough to refund me in full and even paid for the return shipping as well packing seemed fine too guess it was a manufacturing defect hopefully this does n't happen to many others	20
0	did not work right out of the box the heating elements did not get hot so i had to return it otherwise i would be throwing money away do not buy	20
0	ive had this vacumn for about 2 years after about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way still has very good power bad news it doesnt move around easy it is like dragging an old tire around hard to turn and direct canister always rolls over the only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt and dont vacumn that often i guess because i dread using it i am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while but still like i said lots of power if you keep the filter clean	20
0	i was very very disappointed with the performance of the tribest blender i bought it to blend breakfast smoothies nothing fancy just some protein powder and soy milk i even bought the larger cup the unit is very very under powered did not mix the ingredients had to transfer everything to my larger more industrial blender would not recommend this unit for any serious blending save your money or put it towards a better unit this product is a rip off does not even do the most basic blending of a liquid and a powder	20
0	the blender i received also smelled as if it was overheating and the tachometer did not work i am sending it back and will be asking for a refund this clearly is not a reliable blender	20
0	these are not riedel crystal ! after i returned them i told amazon that that need to update the description if you read the fine print it does say manufactured to exact specifications of riedel austria they are made by some other company not in austria and the quality is very very low you get what you pay for	20
0	will work fine if you only use a few light coats not designed for a family of four in a colder region it 's now proped up in the corner as it has lost two leggs and half it 's hooks now shopping for a new one looked nice in the oak	20
0	we ordered a cherry coat rack \( keep in mind cherry is the only color option available on this site for that item \) and it came as light oak i tried to get it exchanged but they were going to make me pay for shipping cause it wasnt their fault i dont know whose fault it is but i ordered a cherry i got something totally different and their customer service didnt service me and wasnt customer friendly never again	20
0	sure it looks nice enough without anything on it but if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it pick something else it 's tippy and it does n't hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off it 's cheap but you 're getting less than what you pay for it could n't last a winter when being used by only two people	20
0	there is n't much to like about these sheets they wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired hanging threads are all over the place i would not recommend these sheets at all	20
0	while the pan handle stays cool the lid handle heats up with the pan you need a pot holder to use the cover i did n't like that	20
0	i love the cookware set 12 pans to do 12 different meals they are very durable and holds up well to the heat	20
0	i was impressed with all the pieces liked the pots with short handles but when washing the lids the handles on top get full of waterand have to be sat up for water to drain out s l o w l e y before putting them away also the metal on the handles has a tendency to get very warm when you 're cooking but what do you want for 30 bucks \?	20
0	i have two bath sheets and two hand towels they do not absorb water	20
0	the piece seemed a little wobbly in the beginning however as time passed it seemed to be straining under its the weight of the 5 lamps now after 5 months it just gave way and the stand came apart extremely disappointed with the product	20
0	i bought this lid in hopes it would fit on an old revere pot i have i does not it is a fine product but it is too big for my needs the main failing of this item is that nowhere in the description was a statement of the precise size of the item	20
0	this coffeemaker 's design is flawed but my customer service experience on complaining about it was the best i 've received from any company in years they sent their new thermal carafe model which appears to have the design flaw with the filter carrier taken care of give them a chance to make it right customer service is part of the equation with any purchase and mr coffee sunbeam has impressed me on that score	20
0	had major problems with it leaking and ended up having to get another \( different brand \) i was shocked and a upset because of the mess it left in my kitchen	20
0	do not buy this expecting the lid in the description ! i never recieved the lid described in the description section they had a similar skillet in colors for less skillet is a quality weight anodized aluminum it has what seems to be a high quality nonstick interior the comfort handle has a good feel and is oven safe to 450 degrees conthe cushion handle means you cannot use in a broiler no top browning your omelet in the broiler	20
0	the slipcover barely covered my sofa will not cover the lower front and it barely hangs over the backside it keeps sliding off where i have to adjust it several times during the day if i could i would get my money back	20
0	the concept here is good no tools needed to install the product itself is well made but the velcro tape does not adhere to the windowsil like it is suppose to the perch keeps falling down and the cats are afraid to use it if there were clips or screws on the perch it would be much better i prefer the cheaper window perches because even though they are not plush they do the job and do not fall down	20
0	bought this model would not brew a full cup of coffee no matter what i did called customer service and they sent me a new one this one also did not work all it did was flash blue lights and never brewed a cup tossed it out and bought a different model by black and decker have had it for months and never had a problem with the new model	20
0	short and not so sweet first unit did not work at all second unit worked for about 3 months then sporatically then quit i should have believed the other reviewers going to try the senseo supreme unit now	20
0	i can put up with the weight the noise the poorly located on off switch the spinning brush that is cool but does n't work what i cannot put up with is how touchy it is to put the cannister back on it will appear to be on correctly but if not the dust collects in the top part of the cannister and will block suction this creates an unmanageable mess when you try to empty the cannister buy something else i ca n't wait for this one to die	20
0	the top does n't seal so shaking and storing the dressing can only be done with tinkering also the bottle being so narrow it 's hard to clean	20
0	i 'd think if i were dyson i would recall all of these big bulky pricey and worthless i thought turbines were designed to spin \? it certainly does not compare to the vacuum at all bought a real one for 17 \( shiping included \) eureka power paw dyson should be ashamed	20
0	for the animal dc17 to be such a great vacuum i thought i was using the turbine tool incorrectly after reading the reviews i realize that there is n't any error on my part it is the tool that is inefficient i emailed dyson to inquire as how to use the tool correctly and they have never responded	20
0	this unit can only dry half of what it can wash which is not that much it takes a total of 4 1 2 hours to do one load of laundry if you only put 11lbs of wash in i have a family of five and i am over run with laudry because of this machine ! !	20
0	i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away	20
0	item worked for one year three weeks then had widely varing temperature readings or indications that the oven had reached over maximum temperature \( 500 degrees \) when oven was set for 325 degrees	20
0	i bought this and one of their wooden pizza peels i thought it would be ergonomically advantageous which it may be but on the first pizza i cut \( on the mountain woods peel \) the edge is now folded over a bit rendering the edge much much less sharp than out of the box so i would suggest you save your 3 and the out sized shipping costs and buy yourself a cutter that may last for a while	20
0	this is horrible at keeping coffee hot it gets cold quick buy another brand i bought this model and a larger zojirushi 1 9 liter stainless steel model at the same time they both are bad and leak heat vapor out like a hissing snake with no off switch the 1 9 ltr one also leaks fluid out even before you press the open button also it is the worst stainless steel i have ever seen it stains instantly and for ever i had another zhjirushi for more than a decade and it was fantastic but something has happened over the last 10 years their quality has really gotten bad	20
0	not as addd says its just a sheet of material that comes it must be cut to fit and is not ehat one would maybe want to do !	20
0	this vacuum worked the first time i used it but that was the only time with the amount of noise it makes you would hope that it would be removing dirt from the floor however what it appears to be doing is using its rotating bristles to redistribute the dirt in a thinner more homogenous layer if you are looking for a machine to use as a sound effect prop for a jet engine this is the one for you	20
0	the fan does work fairly well as an intake fan however in exhaust mode \( the mode i need \) i can barely feel a breeze from either side of the unit it simply does n't work as an exhaust fan therefore to accurately describe the fan it may be a 2 470 cfm intake fan and it is about a 2 cfm exhaust fan i'm returning it by the way the packing slip from air n water states that a 15 restocking fee that applies to all returns i am very unhappy with the fan and will be extremely unhappy with air n water if they try to hit me with a restocking fee	20
0	alas this had no discernable effect on my cats however the product arrived in good time and in good shape	20
0	i was disappointed when it arrived in pieces they didn't pack this well and i had to send it back i was impressed by the free return postage i do want this item and have requested another hopefully it will arrive in one piece this time then it might be worth more stars	20
0	after 6 weeks of waiting customer service said it was going to be another 3 weeks ! forget it ! cancelled order	20
0	i previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal so i bought these as replacements the previous stopper had a thick rubber part that created the seal the rubber sections on these are so thin that they did n't even seal the wine bottle i first tried them on all three stoppers in the set had the same problem oxygen and leakage are death to a wine so a stopper that does n't seal is worse than just replacing the cork	20
0	i received this blender for x mas last year it has some nice design features \( good heavy base to prevent tipping measuring cup built into the cap \) however i experienced the same problems that others here have the blender does n't do well with anything thick like milkshakes it just shoves everything against the sides of the pitcher and spins helplessly forcing you to stop and manual stir everything back towards the blades and restart while it worked ok for a while the cutter unit mysteriously jammed after about 9 months	20
0	2 years ago i purchased these dishes i was so happy with them that i would of given them a 5 star until 6 months ago all of a sudden my dinner plates are breaking in half \( these dishes are microwave safe and no children \) all have broken in the same place 2 broke when picking up 4 have broken while microwavingyet all my cups bowls salad square plates are still in perfect condition but without my dinner plates my set \( s \) are useless ! !	20
0	we 've had this set for about 3 years and after about a year they began to chip and or crack they are beautiful and affordable but they just do not last i had two plates crack in half in the microwave a mug handle break off as i slowly turned it in the dishwasher rack it 's too bad because i really liked this set	20
0	one of the plate i bought broken during a 50 seconds medium heat microwaving so i doubt it is really good for microwave when i called lenox their rep simply asked if i want to order a replacement from them as if the bad quality was not their problem disguesting the design pattern was nice though	20
0	i have to admit that i love this set especially since i found it hard to find white flannel sheets most have some ridiculous pattern on it like snowflakes or snowmen ! so when i found these and at this price i was quite happy they feel great not the best flannel but nice all the same but after washing it 3 times within one month the fabric really weakened and the flat sheet tore later the fitted started getting holes so since this was rather cheap i am not horribly sad about it so if you are looking for comfy warm sheets for one season and then want a selection of rags for the rest of the year for housecleaning this is the set for you	20
0	i returned this item because it was too big for the brother es2000 sewing machine i bought it was very bulky and took up way too much room the machine rattled inside the case and slipped around it would probably be better for a larger machine	20
0	i just do n't like this item got it as a wedding gift and have hardly used it because it sucks plain and simple do n't buy there are others out there that are better not kitchenaid quality here ! ! !	20
0	i find it hard to give this even a 1 star given the price i really thought this would perform to the praise of the other reviewers here 's why i am sorely disappointed 1 \) the quot stainless quot steel does in fact rust and corrode2 \) the rimmed bottom tray has no drains no openings so obviously no incline so water just sits and stagnates and if you live in warm climates will in fact start to mildew3 \) check your water softness because if your water is too hard it will leave calcium and other deposits which require daily cleaning otherwise it will be very unsightly	20
0	i searched for what i thought would be a great dish rack this is without a doubt the worst product i have ever bought ! there is nothing stainless about this ! i have had it for only about 4 months and it is already rusting it was so not worth the money i paid for it i would not recommend buying this product	20
0	does n't whistle as it is supposed to handle get 's very hot \( i have a gas stove \)	20
0	i have been looking for a good cheese plane and this one is n't it it works fine for rubbery semi soft cheeses like swiss but not for harder cheese like cheddar which tend to crrumble before i can finish a slice the problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid it should be thin and flexible also do n't let the name fool you this utensil is made in china a country which consumes very little cheese	20
0	the heater works fine but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet delonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period i will not buy an oil filled heater again	20
0	i spent about 20 minutes trying to ascertain how much this item cost but to no avail whatsoever ! i'm so frustrated after such a lengthy yet futile search that i want to hurt someone ! instead i'm shutting down my browser you idiots should think about how many more sales you 'd make if you just included a price for god 's sake !	20
0	i heard about the lids and hoped that they would be a good alternative to plastic wrap i even bought two for gfts but they did n't live up to my expectations the large size did n't even fit on standard size bowls and the small one did n't fit on small bowls i would return them except that i threw out the original packaging i do n't recommend this product	20
0	while cute this little pan is difficult to use there 's no room to use a spatula so you 'd better like the eggs cooked through you ca n't flip for over easy and the egg white is too deep to do sunny side up also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip so you have to use a potholder plus it 's so small that it wo n't fit any normal sized burner another burn risk to your fingers	20
0	i received the set in the mail and immediately noticed that the contents inside were damaged i returned the item to amazon who issued a prompt refund it appears that the persons handling these fragile items are n't very cautious so i would advise against buying this amazon was great with a prompt refund though	20
0	these rings are much too big and too lightly made for egg muffins and the eggs spill out the bottom of the rings total junk don't waste your money on these ring	20
0	i have been very disappointed in this product if i could return them i would i purchased this product because a friend of mine has some polycarbonate wine glasses which she has had for several years and that still look like new she even washes them in the dishwasher i have only had these for about 6 weeks and have only used them about 4 5 times each time i have hand washed them but they are very cloudy and i am embarrassed to use them i would not recommend them	20
0	never got it to work all i get when i hit the on tare button is in the trash it goes	20
0	sheets are full of wrinkles after being washed not as soft as when new and not the qualiy i anticipated	20
0	the sewing machine is built very cheaply does not even sew correctly i understand i didnot pay that much but to feel you really are just ripping people off its an item i ended up throwing out for it just took up space	20
0	this is not even a toy do not waste your money on this item amazon will charge you to send it back which is what most will do if you expect even the lowest standards in a quick machine nothing about this machine functions well never got an even stitch or a complete row of stitches amazon should not carry this item it has lowered the quality of amazon 's products in my view	20
0	this is not a 2 quart sauce pan it is 2 5 quarts exactly the same as the one that comes with the se	20
0	worst product ever do n't know how it passed through initial testing when you turn the crank to dispense cereal it crushes it and sprays it all over the room awful just awful too embarrassed to even give it away so put it in the trash waste of money and space and we tried dog food which is too hard for it to crush so it just got stuck really made me angry that i wasted the money false advertising	20
0	i purchased four of these shot glasses of the four one has tiny bubbles throughout one has black specs in the glass one has a bulge in the glass and the last is taller than the other three the shape is beautiful but with all the imperfections i 'd recommend something else my most disappointing bodum purchase ever	20
0	it 's a beautiful mug \( we 've bought 2 \) but it drips does n't keep the temperature it 's a nightmare to clean and it 's not higienic unbelievable bad product	20
0	the concept was great but after only a month or so flaws started showing the inserts started bending and warping seperating at the edges and cracking i purchased them for my mother who gave them to my daughter as a gift she loved the idea but will go back to the wooden boards because i do n't think these will be around long and they were not cheap either	20
0	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out it was wonderful wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one i bought this item i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it i was suspect when i opened it poor quality material poor bed fit very very warm on the lowest setting after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires which are quite large in my ribs it had to come off i had rather be cold and i hate being cold	20
0	it 's fairly cheap looking but it does the job the razor holders cannot hold my gillette mach iii turbo razor it slips out	20
0	ordered this at my wife 's request she 's tried cleaning silver earrings run multiple cycles added detergent as suggested it just does n't clean an old toothbrush and toothpaste works much better a very disappointing piece of junk	20
0	poor workmanship rusted inside of chrome cover \( is it really chrome with rust on it \) very poor construction of the rubber piece and is smells like rubber i really do n't want to smell rubber in my closet	20
0	beware ! on off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged the place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it 's been about 2 weeks	20
0	heavy machine looked durable almost commercial put her together and began within 5 minutes of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated ! returned it the following day and bought a bissel that has worked great was cheaper and weighs less !	20
0	the stool is great as far as it 's ability to function it is quite thin which makes it easy to store it does have a safety issue ! ! ! ! ! my 3 year old son got his finger pinched when we were adjusting it to push it together i almost got my finger pinched as well on more than one occassion my husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus no more pinched fingers i would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around i was right there when my son pinched his finger and it was difficult to open the stool back up to release his finger	20
0	if this is in a jade or perhaps brick other earth colors let me know why waste everyone 's time with such a lame description	20
0	we got this as a present and had high hopes to actually use it as a microwave it takes over 7 minutes to warm something up and forget about making microwave popcorn it just does n't pop the kernals overall lots of features but it 's the worst microwave i 've ever owned	20
0	this item arrived with a broken tank and 1 week later quit making mist at al	20
0	checked online comparing many models and purchased one two years ago worked great all winter decided to purchase a second last year year both worked great all winter last year unfortunatly this year neither works despite cleaning and following all instructions guess the quality is put into them just enough to last though the warranty period junk dont buy	20
0	i bought two of these humidifiers one for work and one for home they both broke in the first week	20
0	i bought two of these and within 3 days of each other they both stopped putting out any moisture what a waste of my time and effort	20
0	my holmes humidifer was broken \( no mist \) after 3 months i did send it with a check of 7 more than 2 months ago and have n't receive information from holmes i emailed to ask my case and they tried to fool around i am desperate ! very bad product and bad service ! i never buy holmes product again	20
0	i bought this about two years ago and it never worked very good for me the handle does n't stay together very good and it does n't pick up much i would n't recommend this sweeper to anyone do n't waste your money on it	20
0	this is a lemon lime press the oranges in china must be real small so if your planning on pressing oranges make sure they are small and forget about grapefruit	20
0	gaggia used to be the cat 's meow in espresso they have lost the bubble in the last ten years many other machines do more are easier to use and produce better cups in an easier manner i still have my old gaggia but now rely on a saeko in my home the difference is obvious	20
0	it is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better itemlight and not providing the warmth expected from this price level feels incomplet	20
0	sigh was so excited to receive this item and it arrived today via ups in pieces i should have heeded the previous reviewer 's warning doh ! oh well live and learn live and learn refund please	20
0	when this fountain is freshly cleaned the cats love it the water does stay cool but cat hair lots of that around here clogs the pump and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly it grows slime eeeeuuuw the first pump lasted about three months then the replacement lasted about a month not really worth it because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway	20
0	this appliance has several good features but they are outweighted by the fact that it does not produce a decent piece of toast at the lowest setting one side of the toast comes out too brown the other side barely toasted the inner side of the bread toasts faster than the outer side we did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread setting a timer for 1 minute pressing cancel reversing the bread and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again far too much work	20
0	first of all the item is too small it is about 1 3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1 3 as wide so as you can see it is pretty small so it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again it does not make life easier good in principle but does not work	20
0	when i first put this on i thought hey i ca n't smell it anymore well that illusion only lasted a day and the odor came back i repeated it letting it dry in between as directed until the bottle was empty and it still smells this just wasted my time	20
0	it does n't zap the yap of our newly adopted pomeranian mix although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it but it did n't slow her down much we did everything according to directions and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact we have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well i'm disappointed with this bark collar though	20
0	i had one of the originals with the vaneer look ugly yes but it was actually very sturdy well made unfortunately it got lost in a move then i purchased the newer one it just was n't as good of quality the latch section cracked on me on the fourth or fifth use ! garbage ! pay more on a cuisenart or delongi you 'll be happier	20
0	i bought this cleaner for use in between major vacuuming it clogs very quickly without having swept up very much it is probably fine for floors without carpet	20
0	i returned the item because it fell apart as i was attempting to put it together cheap compressed wood by products and card board even though i did receive a full refund after it was returned i would not recommend it to anyone else i was able to find a solid wood and better made shelf from another vendor	20
0	the knife is constructed well as pictured does not cut very well it just was not very sharp i tried mincing some vegetables it just did n't work as well as my 9 99 serrated tv info knife i was disappointed	20
0	i am sure there is a lesson in my experience i fist purchased the salt and pepper grinding mill balls and found the salt pepper did not go where i wanted it i also found that in order to get a reasonable amount out of the grinder i had to select the maximum coarse setting and over a period of six months the efficiency became so bad i finally threw them away based on a salesmans advise i purchased the dual grinder thinking my problems might be isolated to the shape of the feed tube i am sad to say that i again found it 's performance to be a big disappointment	20
0	this pan was a bargain that turned out to be overpriced i have a number of farberware pans that have served me well but this one came out of the box warped the first time i put it on the range top it was rocking like crazy with only one strip through the center that made contact i could return it but for 10 it is not worth the argument with amazon about restocking fees so after one use it is now washed and packed up in the goodwill box i would never use it again	20
0	first of all it 's expensive \( 60 \) kitchen kaboodle sells the same exact one for 29 99 i tried to return it to the company and found out they 're located in canada so it was going to cost me another 25 00 for shipping due to shipping i was forced to keep it huge rip off ! ! it is good quality but go to kitchen kaboodle for half the cost !	20
0	i bought myself one of these and used it minimally and was happy i then bought one for my daughter she used it about 5 times in a little over a year and it quit the blade assembly as per other reviews it is going to cost about 50 to repair now mine is smelling i am using my old 15 year old oster and it is still working also to my surprise it is doing a better job just not as pretty i have ka stand mixer hand blender food processors large and small emersion blender and attachments for all love all of them will buy other ka but not this again	20
0	with an old coffee can true it does n't have the odor free aspect but if you are scooping a litter box there is going to be odor i just keep the can by the box and dump it in the trash when full same deal	20
0	oversized is a big word for these towels and the quality of the cotton used is very low i washed them once and they already shrank what is worse is that they keep loosing pieces of cotton after i dry with them i have to spend 5 minutes getting rid of cotton bits stuck on my skin definitely a disappointing product even for its low pric	20
0	this red and white cutting board looks attractive and helps brighten up the kitchen counter however it arrived warped so that i really can only use one side \( the board slides around on the counter when i flip it over \)	20
0	i am totally dissatisfy with this product and this is damn waste of money brita base was working for just 2 week initially and now i able to get a water from filter but there is no light glowing either green or red the base was showing red flash light on end of first week for the first new filter which suppose to come upto atleast 2 months i recommed you all dont buy it	20
0	lousy ! ! ! ! the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through i grate a lot of cheese and i am sorry i bought this grater	20
0	this tool is very poorly made when grating cheese the handle tended to twist in the hand making it difficult to control and causing discomfort with medium pressure during use caused the drum to dent ! returned cuisipro grater strongly dissatisified ! looks good but a piece of junk	20
0	it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design the pot does a good job perking coffee but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot i think that melitta should send out for nothing the glass top i am like the other reviews i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits	20
0	we got this rice cooker as a christmas gift we 've tried cooking rice in it three times and all three times the rice has burned it simply gets too hot like some of the other reviewers we added more and more water but it did n't help the cooker finally does kick into warm mode but by then it 's too late we were thrilled when we realized it was non stick but what good is non stick when the rice is scorched beyond edible	20
0	my little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas friends his bedroom was decorated with thomas but the drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for 3 99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding ! i used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block out light because i opened package the other set i send back to amazon i do not recommend this product and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy ! ! ! i bought pottery barn thin wale corduroy panels are excellent light material and block out light	20
0	we bought the scale for starting weight watchers but it does not do weights in fractions i e 1 4 lb etc also it was not as pictured the look of the scale \( in the photo \) was appealing because of the retro look with the red dial ours came with a black dial which is just plane boring average thought its just an average scale and nothing more	20
0	i loved this while it worked this worked great for the first 2 times we used it after that it would n't work it has a 6 month warranty so i am in the process of getting if fixed	20
0	i dont recoment you to buy this product i dont under stand why they made i	20
0	as others have stated the gears are plastic and will fail after 1 to 2 years and no replacement parts to fix so the can opener has to trashed	20
0	its a throw like a blanket i would have been better off with a pretty cutain to think of it it would be better than what i wasted my money on also dont wash this with anything else the die leaks	20
0	they sent me a blue hudson jacquard diamond love seat slipcover 3 times i gave up after the 3rd time what really sux is that they did send the olive sofa cover ! ! ! so now they do n't match ! ! !	20
0	i bought this for my mom and had it sent to her address it worked for two days and then it stopped on my last visit i fiddled with it for an hour but it only worked intermittently she did n't keep the receipt so i'm writing it off as a waste of money when you think about it the inexpensive softsoap brand push pump dispensers make more sense you can see when they are empty and you do n't have to keep up with batteries i do n't buy the argument that the hands free dispenser is more sanitary than the hand pumps because after you touch the hand pump you wash your hands	20
0	because just around the 60 day mark the chime turned into a terrible noise like something dying i just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser but a month later \( 3 months after original purchase \) the thing is spewing soap non stop wasted lots of soap this way changing the batteries did n't help soap just flows out until there 's none left to maintain some customer satisfaction sharper image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control	20
0	this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image it broke the second week i had it spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor it 's pure crap stay away ! !	20
0	i purchased this set of spoons because they are narrow and can fit into any number of spice jars i also wanted them because they are hinged and nest inside of each other take up little space after first use the pin fell out and the spoons became unhinged i tried to reassemble and the pin keeps falling out would n't recommend	20
0	the lower bowl part will last forever but the water tank lasts a month outside between the sun and cold air the plastic get weak right away and the slightest touch will crack the top i have gone through 3 of them all with exactly the same results	20
0	a very impressive looking oven the temperature dial did not reflect the actual internal temperature of the oven by 50 to 75 degrees once i got that sorted out the oven worked well about 20 times then the motor started to sputter on and off burning electrical odor filled the air and an arcing sound could be heard while it worked it worked well i do not know if the defect is common or rare i tested only one oven	20
0	i have been looking for one of these for a couple of weeks for the price i thought it would work great first it was the size of a salt shaker \( did not read description well enough \) second upon first use while trying to apply a coating of powdered sugar on my funnel cake i thought i was going to throw my shoulder out the sugar just will not come out of the fine mesh in the lid i had higher hopes for this unfortunately it is now packaged for a return journey back to amazon and i am continuing my quest for the perfect funnel cake shaker	20
0	table came with chipped wood on one leg when put together the chip got even worse the table is horribly unsteady would not recommend to anyone	20
0	received set and tumblers are not good quality the edges are quite sharp and the glass still sweats would not recommend	20
0	i received the clock in good condition but even though i tried several batteries it never worked i did not return it because the shipping would have cost more than the clock ! it ended up in the trash i guess you really do get what you pay for	20
0	i grind beans for my coffee every morning i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder sold the old grinder in a garage sale i do regret buying this grinder it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10 my main complaint is that it is messy the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it also coffee grounds are everywhere i always have to use a cloth to clean up not a good buy	20
0	when my krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service i decided to order the capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted quot cool grind quot i wish i had ordered the krups instead the capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee and the design ensures that no matter how careful you are you will spill ground coffee all over your counter in the time since i bought it another reviewer has reported that his or her capresso broke within six months do not buy this model	20
0	after remodelling our kitchen i wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out when i saw the picture of the towel holder i thought it unique with its scroll work and would n't look like everything else i saw when i received it the first thing i noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible i tried with no luck to remove the stains the area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt ! all in all i would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship	20
0	i always buy products from amazon and i never have any complains about any of them but about this product i am so disappoint because the lids does'nt fit with the 32 oz containers i hope that they fix this problem because is a good way to keep your kitchen organized	20
0	i bought this as my second fryer the third time i used this fryer the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid would n't close properly and that 's the end of it prior to buying this fryer i had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine	20
0	i made a mistake in buying this item thinking since i had one when i was little it would be similiar it is not the edges are stiff and strings are pulling out the fuzz all over the blanket gets all over your sheets it is a raggedy sorry substitute for my cozy soft one i remember	20
0	i got them free with purchase of wamsutta sheets these blankets are of really cheap quality thin mesh like texture threads get loose at the ends leaving traces of fabric everywhere i got rid of it cause i am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies	20

0	the humidifier worked great for 2 weeks but now leaks all over the floor during operation i would not recommend buying this product	20
0	this product is ok it 's just a larger version of the upholstery tool that you probably already have with the vacuum the head is eight inches wide with two little strips of lint catching fabric the extra width lets you vacuum areas twice as fast but for what it is this attachment is ridiculously overpriced	20
0	corrected review on september 1st after using it five times to stir soft ice cream i used this spatula to stir flour into oil and it broke with the steel stem sticking out amazon emailed the promise to refund this product but i have n't seen the refund yet	20
0	this bread box had to be fixed by the time i received it it was a minor thing and works well however i would not have bothered buying the box had i known that there would be problems with it	20
0	i thought this breadbox was beautiful in the picture and unique because of the two compartments the construction however is horrible the wood was split at the screw locations on the lid i returned the box and received another one the wood was split at the screw sites on the bottow of the second box it is very poorly put together and the material is cheap this certainly is not worth the price	20
0	i purchased this high end toaster oven because i wanted needed a proficient smaller oven for smaller baking needs after 5 months of moderate usage however the middle knob has malfunctioned and it will no longer bake other than that i was satisfied with the product i called their customer service and to get it repaired under warranty will have to ship it at least 250 miles away at my expense what a hassle i may just go buy a cheap toaster oven to replace it instead of spending the time and money on postage live and learn just because a product costs more does n't mean it 's better	20
0	we had a rude awaking today our delonghi toaster was on fire i will never again buy any delonghi product the defective design is in the toast switch it is mechanical when it finishes toasting it sometimes continues to the always on position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast very very hot we literally had a house full of smoke a toaster full of flames you were warned funny thing is delonghi makes an attractive product sad thing is they can cost you your house or worse	20
0	i purchased this toaster oven because i loved its exterior design and thought it would look great in my kitchen it did until the middle knob came off after less than 6 months of use i 've been using a pair of pliers to turn it on for the last 5 months while i await my replacement part i have followed up on my request with delonghi customer service on a number of occassions and they offer no solution other than to continue to wait i even left a message with a supervisor and received no response whatsoever i vow to never buy a delonghi product again still waiting for that knob	20
0	ok this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds not minutes also it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil really its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge stupid stupid stupid design the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together its like a rubics cube a true waste of 40 bucks do n't buy this ! it does n't even look very cool	20
0	will not last long only a few months old and getting weak alread	20
0	i bought three of these mugs based on a recommendation by mens health magazine none of the mugs works correctly and the chrome ring on the cover has come off of each one initially this looks like a great idea but if the slots do n't line up just right the mug will not work i have three of these mugs and each set of slots lines up differently stay away from this product if you wish to avoid agravation	20
0	great coffee and a convenient size but the carafes keep breaking on me ! i used the original carafe just a few times before it broke i ordered a replacement and was extra careful when handling it \( especially when washing it \) i used the carafe maybe five times before it broke these things just seem to spontaneously combust the carafes are 12 a piece so it 's not worth replacing again argh	20
0	as you can see in the picture the pestle \( the part you hold in your hand \) has quite a wide bottom unfortunately this spreads out the force that you can apply to any single location making it practically impossible to grind seeds \( e g cumin \) to dust i tried it once on cumin seeds and gave up	20
0	i liked this when it arrived however after a few uses the pestle broke in two the pestle is hollow and apparently quite fragile making it of little use	20
0	the quality of the workmanship is awful ! i did n't even get to use it the top had chips in it and the bottom of the pestle had a huge crack that looks like it happened during the firing process	20
0	the price seemed great and i really liked the modern look when i took it out of the box got disappointed by how cheap everything looked assembly was very easy it took my boyfriend about 15 minutes \( the most \) the design is really great it 's very compact perfect for small spaces and would look awesome if materials were a little bit better great idea poorly executed would gladly pay a lil more for this futon if it was a better quality product my main concern is that the construction seems like it would n't last too long i feel like i should attach sit carefully tag to it before anybody comes over	20
0	i 've had my futon a little over two months and was very happy with it initially until one day two of the wooden slats which are all held in place with plastic fell apart \( and i only weigh 100lbs \) i tried everything to fix the problem to no avail so considering it only lasted a few months it really is not worth the money at all the price is cheap but so is the quality for what it will cost me to replace this one i could 've bought a much better quality futon without the disappointment and aggravation	20
0	i have the same problem as sillygal00 the spout does n't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove ! i'm returning it	20
0	this tea cattle is absolutely adorable it is not practical for daily use the spout does n't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove the lid does n't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move	20

0	i also had a problem with the coating flaking off within the first week of using it the only reason i still use it is because i'm a poor college student that got it as a gift in the first place and ca n't afford a new one after scrubbing the inside bottom of the wok furiously i managed to get all the flakes off and then some the lid is made of thin aluminum and has bent almost completely out of shape awful product do not buy this wok	20

0	take a look at the ingredient list alcohol is first then water this product does n't do anything more than plain old rubbing alcohol does except for make you about twenty bucks poorer regarding some of these reviews smells like rubbing alcohol \? why yes that 's because it is stings \? yes it 's rubbing alcohol someone recommended a spray bottle for easier application \? well yes \( and duh \) what a better way to fly through an expensive product that would last much longer if you used cotton balls unless you 've got money to burn it 's just nonsense to buy this i used it and noticed no difference between it and rubbing alcohol except the price	20

0	some how my previous review text got a little glitched up but suffice it to say the only thing going for these knives is that the probably cut the manufacture of these knives is well below the quality i expected it 's the first time i ve been totally disappointed we 're returning the knives because they are not worth the money really they look great in the picutre but they are very poor quality why else would a four hundred dollar set be selling for twentysix dollars	20
0	ditto the other 's observations the thermostat seems to register the temperature of the unit itself rather than the room i had the thing in a 63 degree room had it set to 85 degrees it would register 90 after 30 seconds of running turn off slowly ramp back down to 84 degrees over a 2 minute time period and then repeat the temperature of the room never got above 64 degrees	20

1	this is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone i am not in the habit of writing reviews but this juicer earns it perhaps you are like me and have never used a juicer before you want to get one without taking out a small loan because you just do n't know if your that into it if so this is your juicer there are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting i just want to back those up with my experience this is a good strong product	20
1	this is a significant improvement over the 750 model the 750 model was not very well designed the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic we returned this we got the 760 to replace that the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem for the same price as the 750 the 760 comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed	20

1	my only complant is that the cord is shorter then i am used to but i guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind this feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly it sucks great is easy to clean and light weight the price is fantastic	20

1	this is probably one of the best blade grinders out there the top locks nicely and serves well as a measuring cup eliminating the scoop step it has three coarseness settings that seem to work well enough to differentiate along with cup amounts the amount lever is a little hard to tell what cup amount its on however anyways bottom line it grinds great with little mess	20

1	my husband and i fight over this plate when we have frozen pizza a tombstone pizza fits great on this plate	20
1	i bought this sauce pan last week the quality is very good the handle design is quite comfortable i tested the even heat distribution by broiling the water and watched the water bubbles forming at the bottom of the pan i found no hot spot it responded to the change in the heat setting is average it 's kind of heavier than all clad ltd for the same size of pan i'm not sure about how long it will last under the normal daily usage yet for the initial impression this calphalon one non stick cookware can stand up to the more expensive cookware such as all clad ltd stainless steel mc2 look for the bargain it 's worth the cost	20
1	this is a great cookie sheet i chose stainless steel because of possible health issues associated with using teflon or aluminum and because i know it 's durable my mom bought one elsewhere a few years ago and when i compared the two mine was much heavier and better quality i would highly recommend this pan especially since it was part of the 4 for 3 promotion and i was able to get 2 of these along with 2 of the 9 round cake pans from this company for only 30 ! a great deal	20
1	this is a very nice piece of furniture well built good quality it was shipped via ups and the box was quite damaged when it arrived thank goodness for good packaging or it would have been destroyed one of the doors did have a crack in it and a new door is to be shippped shortly a new mode of shipping should be considered	20

1	this is a great product it really holds a lot and is great for stoups \( thicker than soup but thinner than stews \) and can hold meats like a pork tenderloin quite easily	20
1	i 've used this for indian food and it worked really well you an prepare the meat and keep it on the part with the heat off before you mix it back into the masala btw i own other anolon advanced saucepots and love the way they cook and cleanup re the squishy handle if you have gripping problems as many middle age to older cooks do this helps you do n't listen to the young self involved and obviously inexperienced cooks who blast this feature some day they too will develop weak wrists or arthritis and will appreciate this feature	20
1	this purchase came with 3 stackable racks i thought it was only one rack it stores very easily in a compact space and works well i do n't know if it rusts since i have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it	20

1	it really does make a difference when some of the chlorine is filtered out of your coffee \( and even more so in your bourbon \) water but these filters are a rip off price wise it 's hard to believe braun would n't make money selling them at a third of the price	20
1	it is one product that my husband misses more than me when he travels \) what you probably do n't see on the picture well it stands on plastic so it does not spill pepper after you are done grinding has really easy refill no mess no fuss and you can always see when you need to buy pepper i do n't think there is better pepper grinder out there others i saw are certainly better looking artsy whatever but this one is the most useful !	20

1	i bought this glass for my wife \( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine \) as a christmas gift last night she tried out the glass with a friend the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch the wine from this glass tasted far far superior to the same wine from an ordinary red wine glass in fact they poured the remaining wine from the ordinary glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different superior one	20

1	i bought this for my husband 's birthday b c i watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there carafes that leak coffeemakers that do n't keep the right temperature etc this is the kind of coffee you get at a 5 star restaurant in fact they probably use a bunn the design is utilitarian not decoration and they have mastered the art of great tasting coffee	20
1	the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to grill area regidity of the cast iron grill control for raising or lowering goals large charcoal shelf three compartments within the charcoal shelf heavy guage metal construction the option of adding a rotisseriethe grill is wanting in regards to lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals	20

1	we have tried a variety of knife sharpeners and they did n't work very well finally i purchased this item and we have been quite pleased ever since friends even ask to use it if you need sharp knives for cooking then this item is a great purchase the cost may seem higher than most but well worth the quality and it really sharpens both serrated and straight knives easy to use and nice addition to a kitchen where you enjoy cooking	20
1	pros i have two chocolate labs therefore i have a lot of hair to deal with the vacuum works great and really takes care of the hair and dirt \( wood floors \) it works alright on rugs cons not cheap loud the plastic clip used to connect the strap to the vacuum comes out so you ca n't carry it you just have to roll it instead not a big deal	20
1	these pans are made by ekco and durable the nice thing is they do not brown the edges like the tephlon coated ones just be sure to use wax paper on the bottom and they will come out with ease	20
1	i took a chance on ordering these and i'm glad i did they are heavy duty ! i like the handles as i do a lot of microwave cooking and it 's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware i 've also used these in a convection oven and them seem to work really great ! i picked the sapphire color and they are very attractive on the table as well !	20
1	i was surprised by the quick delivery i opened the box to check the bowls everything was intact and i was happy to give them to my cousin as a wedding present	20
1	i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly i feel we made a good choice	20
1	this rice cooker has a non stick bowl which makes clean up a cinch ! the indicator light is red when cooking and green when warming it cooks the rice perfectly every time also this cooker is small and easy to store	20
1	i love this had seen items like it and so broke down now i am sorry i have not had one for years and year	20
1	it was a christmas gift truly enjoyed by my grandson who loves to cook \( with supervision \) it 's easy to store and able to keep the oil in its container for several uses bigger than the grandaddy so you can cook more at one time it 's great have one myself and it has been with us for years	20
1	due to the slits around the opening this label will fit a wide variety of neck sizes including burgundy and those odd rosemount shiraz necks i would like it better if it were more of a plastic coated paper since i think it would hold up longer in a cellar but at least it fits all my bottles the others i 've purchased do n't	20
1	we love this crate for our pug but she is a smart little dog she has learned how to get the zipper on the end undone and escape of course when she does this no one is home and we find small gifts left behind	20

1	i bought these for a wonderful craft i was expecting them to be decent but i did not expect them to be as nice as they were if i realized how nice they were then i would of purchased several at the same time to save on shipping i realize that i got 100 bags but my craft took about 75 of them they are nicer than the piping icing bags that i used while i was learning cake decorating when these are gone i will definitely order more the plastic is thick enough so you will not have to worry about your icing tip squeezing out	20
1	i have tried sooo many different roti tortilla makers and this saachi is seriously the best out there ! bargainoffers com company is the best ! they have great customer service and are such nice people i have tried the crappy villaware 10 inch model as well as the horrible 8 inch revel brand and i had nothing but problems they stick and dont heat up well enough the saachi is great never had a problem ever !	20

1	this knife along w the matching 7 5 star meat fork are my weapons of choice for carving leg of lamb prime rib ham veal turkey etc at various carving stations at my job i love the 5 star line have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife i 'd recomend trying the 4 star pro s line out as well before deciding on this line \( same blades different handles \) i 'd definately replace if lost stolen after using proper tools there 's no way you can go back to cheap knives i 'd love to see a 12 version of this knife w a wider blade	20
1	what a fabulous pillow and a great deal they looked small until i unpacked them then poof ! big fluffy pillows ! nice	20
1	i have two kittens which are spoiled rotten and have more toys than they can ever wish for this is by far one of their favorites they love the moving ball and use the center scratch area often \( keeps them off the furniture and other areas \) i know they play with it daily very reasonably priced and definitely a must for cats ! !	20
1	my husband received a similar bag for christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer we are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine the black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we do n't have to worry about the bottom falling out the material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well	20
1	looks and works just as advertised took it out of the box and used it the day we received it made for a lovely and lively family dinner great buy	20
1	holds everything makes perfect pot roasts i use all clad mc2 for most cooking but when i need to braise i use this i love it	20
1	this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake the 5 quart was worth the money do n't buy the 4 qt save the money and purchase the 5 you 'll be glad that you did	20
1	works great it is a lot easier than using paper filters	20
1	i have several oxo spatulas they do n't warp bend peel discolor or melt even if used to stir things in a hot pan so far none of them have broken and i have had several of them for a few years great quality	20
1	i very much like this sommlier glass but they are quite fragile a significantly better choice for everyday use is the schott zwiesel diva line of glasses granted the riedel glass is thinner at the rim but man for my dollar the schott glasses are a steal	20
1	i was looking for something small to put near our litterpan since the cats track the clay out of the box when exiting i found this vacuum at a fair price and decided to give it a try it does a perfect job ! i owned the original model when it first came out years ago this one is more streamlined and improved the dustbuster is the right choice for little cleanups	20
1	yep i had some 20 year old revere ware pots and this steamer fit my 2 qt pan with no problem and the lid from the pan fit the steamer it 's plenty big to steam two large sweet potatoes and probably more exactly what i needed and the price was good too	20
1	this bread slicer is quite good it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves i have found though that if i bake the largest size loaf the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container	20
1	wife loves this contraption if you like your coffee or tea strong you need to use more than usuall easy to clean and the best part is that amazon sent me two of them when i purchased one sweet cup it comes with is great quality peace !	20
1	i am potty training my son so i needed a good waterproof mattress pad but did n't want to spend a lot of money this fits the bill it 's lightweight but sturdy and has already stopped one naptime accident from soaking through to the mattress and held up well in the wash so far has a nice feel and it does n't seem to make him overly warm as some waterproof pads do our mattress is old and thin by today 's standards but the pad seems roomy enough that i think if we got a new thick mattress it would still work very pleased with this purchase	20
1	love it ! fluffy warm and light perfect for snuggling up into on those cold blustery days or for building a make shift fort \) big enough to comfortably cover \( and keep warm \) many people and it 's wonderfully light so it does n't bog you down while you sleep wonderful	20
1	i searched for months for a stylish durable set of flatware at a bargain price and this is it ! i was lucky enough to buy service for 8 at half price during a friday sale the design is unique and contemporary and the finish and weight are of excellent quality the only criticism that i have is that there is a big size difference between the soup spoons and dessert spoons the handles of the dessert spoons are a bit too short for my taste and tend to get caught in the flatware rack in my dishwasher however this is a very small price to pay for such a gorgeous inexpensive set of flatware that will surely last for many years to come	20
1	we purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago it has held up so well that i just purchased ten more place settings \( the friday only sale \) to use for entertaining our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day this flatware is heavy and really nice to hold \( the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from \) the super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions	20
1	i see a lot of people have leaky shakers not me mine is absolutely perfect the top strainer piece fits snugly leak free requiring just the right amount of effort to de couple it from the canister the design of the canister lip also makes it easy to attach the top to the canister the lip on some shakers makes it hard to attach the top the cap jigger also fits perfectly with just the right amount of snugness that it stays attached but also comes off easily	20
1	i use this mug a lot for chicken noodle and other soups as well as salads its easy to clean up and to handle i like having the lid with the pop top so its does n't make a mess in the microwave i fits easily in the tote bag when commuting to work i highly recommend it ! !	20
1	i did n't know which maker i wanted it was hard making up my mind i finally chose this one and boy did i make the right choice it works great better than i could have hoped for cookies turned out wonderful and it was fast and easy	20
1	this soap dish is beautiful practical and sturdy best of all it will retain all water and liquid soap leftovers in its tray leaving your bathroom clean and dry recommended	20
1	i bought 2 of these and they are so soft and comfy i love these blankets they are so superior to other blankets in their price range the main reason i bought them was the price the colors are very nice too	20
1	i have two of these one in yellow and one in a discontinued sea greeny color they 're attractive of course this is fiestaware after all but they 're darn functional they 're long enough to accommodate a london broil or small roast or kebobs and they 're deep enough that any juices are not likely to spill while you 're carrying or serving i like wish there was one slightly bigger too then i 'd get two more	20
1	this product is great to have on hand in the past i 've used purchased yogurt as a starter but this eliminates the need to run to the grocery store when you want to make yogurt after a small delivery snafu the company immediately sent me a replacement they also sent me a follow up e mail just to make sure that i received the product \( thanks fred ! ! !	20
1	this timer was a christmas gift for mom she loved it she thought it was very cute	20
1	this core is remarkable it is so easy to use just fill it with cake batter and insert it in the cake pan pour the remaining batter in the pan and large cakes come out wonderful this heating core allowed by daughters half sheet cake to come out perfect	20
1	love it that it keeps the butter soft and spreadable and fresh this one holds a larger amount than others i have had it is a bit more awkward to hold however it has a wide lid with no handle so you need to grab on to the sides of the lid to pick up love the emile henry colors	20
1	let 's face it you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated nice furniture and practical book shelves but you do not live alone there is probably a canine or feline lurking around it may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of garfield on it or some cutesy saying but in the long run this durable multi use dishwasher safe bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he she wants a few laps of water	20
1	this 2 qt bowl has many uses i use it for mixing serving and baking it is wonderful for macaroni and cheese also have done cobblers i have 6 different colors once you get one you will have to get another and another	20
1	not many people can rationalize spending twenty dollars on a pizza cutter but i previously worked at a pizzeria and often make gourmet pizzas at home this cutter is sharp and rarely requires multiple cuts to slice through all of the crust it is really useful on those thick pizzas like spinach and feta plus it looks pretty cool hanging on the wall behind your cutting board i almost never use it for any non pizza cooking and a heavy sharp knife works almost as well however it 's a fun item and if you find yourself looking for a nice gift for somebody who makes a lot of pizza i definitely recommend it	20
1	i'm really happy with this shoe rack i 'd like it to be a little bit taller but it holds the shoes very effectively and fits well in my closet i 'd definitely recommend it	20
1	this shoe rack is extremely well made very stable and solid and very easy to assemble ! this hold alot of shoes and spins really nice i have small feet but even my husband shoes which are 11 's fit just fine ! this shoe rack is perfect i highly reccomend it !	20
1	i have these sheets on my bed right now they are very comfortable and soft after just one washing the price was great and the striping addds style to otherwise bland white sheets	20
1	i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved i definitely recommend it i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special	20
1	works great bought for making candle tarts and it did n't let me down i would recommend this hot plate for any use	20
1	these pans are great they are very sturdy and good quality do n't buy anything else ! trust me	20

1	i love the large size of these glasses its great for swirling your wine we had a large party and everyone commented on how elegant they looked and how much fun they were to drink from	20
1	i 've got a dog cat and a small child my floors have been a mess ! i am so glad i bought this vaccuum the suction is great and it picks up all the animal hair great price too i would highly reccomend this to anyone especially people with pets we emptied it 4 times just doing the living room the day we got it in the mail now my hubby vaccuums regulary he loves it too	20
1	i love it ! my kids and i had it open 10 minutes and ordered another one for my mom ! !	20
1	a great quality french press that made bodum famous simple easy to clean and quick ! ideal for the times when you need a nice cup of fresh brew coffee but could n't find a coffee maker nearby	20
1	i have some nice nonstick cookware that i needed whisks for so i got these my main reasons for choosing them were the brand and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone rather than silicone coated steel unfortunately that is not the case this is silicone coating metal this is acceptable though because the 5 year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off and 5 years of cookware safe whisking for this price is worth it to me ! the whisk is wonderful and i 'd recommend it to anyone just do n't believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above	20
1	the spatula is very good cooking in high temperatures on the stove the food does not fall through the slots it is so nice to not have the yoke broken when flipping the egg over when frying it is good for dipping out food out of dishes also the only thing was the loop on the end of the handle was broken when i received it it did n't hurt the function of the spatula it is a great tool to have in the kitchen	20
1	i 've seen this particular clock at other web sites i decided to buy it from target com because the price was good and there is free shipping when i received the clock in only 3 days i was pleasantly surprised to see first how well it had been packed it arrived in perfect condition i inserted an aa battery only to wonder whether i had gotten a dud it did n't make any perceptible tick soon it was clear that the clock was working well and i hung it in my newly remodelled kitchen in a prominent place and i love it i highly recommend this very quiet well made clock	20
1	after mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf with an interesting pattern on the crust my first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly it is much easier than hand shaping a loaf and much more rustic natural than using a loaf pan the natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the old fashioned way when it 's done rising carefully remove it from the basket and care fully put it on a pre heated bread stone in the oven the loaves look and taste great	20
1	nice compact size can be moved easily does freshen the air in the room noticeably on whisper setting is almost silent on turbo setting can be heard but in no way impinges on life maybe would sleeping does shoot out air but does not blow with any force over time like a day all the air in our 20'x20' living area changes did have a noticeable plastic like new odor the first few days of use which wore off have n't had any build up on the collection grid in these 2 weeks but it would be easy to clean	20
1	this stainless steel stock pot is just right for those of us who ca n't fit our favorite soup recipes into a dutch oven cleaning it is a breeze and it is still small enough to fit on a convenient cabinet shelf that says it all	20
1	i 've cleaned my wedding rings and watches with it and am happy with its performance no it does not clean as well as the ones at the jewelry store nevertheless it gets the in between job done quite nicely	20
1	this bowl is very durable and i love the different colors that it comes in the bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times we basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream popcorn nachos etc i love these bowls and am going to buy a set of fiestaware for my mom	20
1	cast iron pans are the way to go no dangerous non stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them this one is probably the best i have ever owned only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges but for pancakes etc this is perfect get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you 'll have bases covered	20
1	we had an ancient kitchen aid and i loved it but always had to store it in the cupboards since it was so big and clunky our daughter now has it and is happy with it we bought the hamilton beach mixer and i like it almost as much as the kitchen aid the best thing about it is that the mixer lifts up making things a bit easier the only slight complaint i have is that the medium to high speed is a big jump it 's a little too fast for what i want most of the time another plus is that it sits beautifully on my counter	20
1	i bought these for christmas presents for a few people and they loved them ! they were an incredible deal warm and appropriately sized they were so great that now i want to go back to get some for myself colors were great too	20
1	ove glove is great everything they say it is my husband is the chef it was my valentine 's day gift to him and he 's happy as a clam ! thanks ove glove	20
1	this product worked as well as expected and the vendor was easy to deal with the product shipped on time	20
1	i like this grater it 's easy to use and clean and nothing is better on salad than freshly grated cheese	20
1	these pans are light and clean up great just do n't use metal in them will buy more	20

1	my three cats adore this playpen just moments after putting it on the floor they started playing with the tease they also love snuggling in the bed together \( 2 cats fit at a time \) my only complaint is that i ca n't find the replacement teases they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non catnip styles the manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and i ca n't find them at petco 's online store i would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find	20
1	works great can use easily and waffles taste great ! my kids could live on waffles if i would let them and this is an asset to have in any kitchen makes extra light and fluffy waffles	20
1	i was pleased with these canisters the lids do not screw on but seem to be airtight with the rubber seal the only complaint i have is that they appeared to be shiny in the photo but are actually brushed stainless	20
1	this knife is great for hard cheeses i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily but if you only use it for cheese it should stay sharp for a long time this is another beautiful global knife	20
1	the last 2 pitcher 's i had lasted 3 years what more can you say	20
1	we have some pretty nasty water from the tap but this pur filter system makes it taste so good i like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once the hand held ones i 've used hold about 3 i do n't know how pure the water is but it sure tastes great	20
1	i have been using this cushion for a couple of years now i use to be able to buy it at walgreens but they no longer carry it i was so happy when i found it on amazon i have several of the cushions around i keep one in my car one at home one at work and now i have one to travel with i take it on airplanes when i travel i have broken my tailbone twice and the shape of the cushion takes pressure off of the tailbone i have recommended it to relatives and friends and they all pruchased it and love it	20
1	i received this knife for christmas after reading the review in cook 's illustrated magazine and then requesting it on my gift list ! my son ordered it through amazon and it arrived before christmas it is now my favorite knife and is used daily after cutting veggies fish meats and fruit this knife continues to be extremely sharp well balanced and easy to use what a great gift	20
1	i bought one of these for my apartment and it 's quite an investment considering the constant cost of refills it does contain the odor better than a garbage can but does not completely eliminate it the instructions seem a bit confusing at first but it 's a piece of cake once you figure out what they are trying to show with that in mind it 's a step in the right direction and does a fair job of containing the odor \( particularly for indoor environments \) and is a better alternative than the hooded litterbox for kitty 's respiratory system	20
1	this lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole it is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole soup tureen handles are sturdy but short so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder but easy to grip with bare hands because of this feature you may decide to use this as a serving dish only good for a large group rather than due to large capacity we are a family of 2 so we would prefer a smaller casserole from lenox	20
1	i 've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty gloppy mess i throw in it including shortening butter cream cheese sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine i spend less time cleaning up then i would have with glass as more is pushed out i have n't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version they both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are	20
1	i purchased this for my niece who was pregnant at the time she started using it right away she said she feels like the last two trimesters were the easiest and gives credit to feeling healthier since using this juicer she said it 's very user friendly and easy to clean up	20
1	i got this oven as a replacement for an older delonghi model we 've been using for years in the office kitchen my staff loves it i ca n't wait until they make me some cookies !	20
1	these are nice quality sheets but i was a little disappointed i was expecting them to feel more satiny	20
1	delighted with them an franciscan apple collectors delight nice air tight lids	20
1	my parents live in florida so we got two of these and rechargable batteries for use in case of storms and power outages the fan is very quiet when operating i like the fact that it runs on batteries great addition to the hurricane survival kit !	20
1	great to have crust all around on your cornbread slice ! ! ! you have to spray the pan really really well with cookingspray then heat it before you put the batter in to allow thecornbread to come out in one piece i run a little spatulaaround the edges before i dump the pan gave one as a giftat christmas and it was a hit ! ! !	20
1	i love this salad spinner it works easily for two people spins great and best of all it keeps salad incredibly fresh for many days i highly recommend it	20
1	i like this style of salad spinner when i ordered it though i did n't realize that it is as small as it is it would be adequate for one person who does n't chow down on salad all day i recomend the product if you do n't have much salad to spin	20
1	i am very pleased with the chemire dinnerware set it is very durable and the colors are great the dishes are larger than i had expected they are a little heavy due to the size and thickness i would recommend them to others	20
1	like the other reviewers it would be nice if the plastic was metal but i love this little thing ! i usually have tons of honey everywhere just put a little hot water in the base let sit for a few minutes and it pours out great ! so easy that even my little kids can use it without making too much mess	20
1	glasses focus aromas well and provide a nice counter point to reidel anyone who worries about lead content need not because there is very little free lead in a glass and none is water soliable	20
1	yes it is made to be a decanter for half bottles but yes it does easily hold a full bottle what i use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner so i decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed if you use it in the same manner you do not have to worry about the size \( but again it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact \) i also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table and guests love it	20
1	for the cheap price \( on sale i think it was 5 \) i paid on it it is pretty good quality and is soft if	20
1	i bought these sheets 6 8 months back i have been using these sheets regularly even after many wash i do n't see the sign of lint coming out this seems to be one of my great value for money very soft and cozy excellent for winter even after many wash there are no sign of lints excellent for the price	20
1	if you want the retro look and a super toaster this is the one for you toasts perfectly and looks great ! i 've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering it 's a big toaster shape is unusual \( taller in back than the front \) which gives it a little character ! excellent !	20
1	this krups toaster is the best i have ever used ! perfect toast every time the wide slots center bagels properly and you have the option to toast the cut side only or both sides the lift function eliminates trying to fish out small pieces with a fork or knife the defrost function works great if large bread slices dont fit properly horizontally they will fit vertically as the toaster is deep enough to handle these large slices the crumb tray slides out easily eliminating the usual mess in cleaning out a toaster all in all the best toaster i have ever owned	20
1	i purchased this in cobalt blue it goes with my fiestaware dishes as well as my pzaltsgraf and longerberger pottery i also agree that the color and glaze are beautiful and much nicer in person than online it has a large capacity and pleasing lines i 'll most likely purchase an additional one in another color for larger holiday meals to be able to use more than one	20
1	we 've had this toaster for over a year and my family loves it it toasts consistently it accommodates all widths and the digital selector is great	20
1	this is just what i was looking for i use it for the few dishes that do n't make it in to the dishwasher but mostly for drying the baby bottles the bottle drying systems are pretty ugly and can only be used for that purpose this drying rack is very useful for the bottles and dishes	20
1	this is a great heater it warms up the room very quickly it has a nice feature of oscillating it also works as a fan the thermometer is good	20
1	i had a regular incandescent book like in the same format with the light on an extendable arm lasted a good while but the bulb finally went and i could n't find a good replacement i saw the triple led book light and knew right away that it would be perfect i looked at a lot of lights and nothing compares to this you get great light that you can direct exactly where you need it and it only uses aaa batteries ! defintely gets the 5 star rating	20
1	i received the shams and was suprised with the colour these are almost a mustard yellow not what i would call sunlight the picture shown reflects a lot of light thus looking paler the quality looks to be good and i did wash and iron them they do look good with my bedspread \( a blue laura ashley floral \) and pick up the yellow in it for the price i think they are a good buy it 's nice to have a change now and again	20
1	i was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter it appears to be a little on the thin side but is very warm i got this for the dogs and they seem to like it the pillow shams are only standard instead of king very good price too ! ! ! !	20

1	the cookies were amazing i really liked using these cutters they came 5 days earlier which was perfect since i was doing them for bridal shower favors the only problem i had was that i ordered two of the same size and when they came in the mail one was smaller i had two different size cookies	20
1	this stock pot is enamel on steel not cast iron it was never meant to be no reason for any confusion i 've had mine for 5 years there are no chips or scratches no matter what i 've made spaghetti sauce posole or any kind of soup nothing has ever burned nor has the enamel come away from the pot turn the heat down i always get perfect results lecreuset comes with a great guarantee in regards to workmanship and defects shame on anyone who purchases cookware in this day and age and does n't follow up with the manufacturer when there is an issue such as some i 've read above	20
1	as a vintner we remove the co2 from the wine as part of our process this device uses co2 to pop the cork very clever however this minor introduction of co2 is insignificant and will vent quickly at times there is an off taste like a lubricant or something which affects the initial taste of the wine let it breath for a while 5 minutes or so and it seems ok this device works well on corks but is a hit and miss on composites and plastics do not use it on partially filled bottles as it takes to much gas from the small cylinder to be effective rew	20
1	the quality of the china is very good the weight and feel of the product is substantial i was disappointed in the color and antique look to them from the pictures i thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive they almost look dirty instead of antiqued but the price is right and they are certainly adequate for every day use for my family	20
1	i 've have looked for a very long time for this lighter quality and easy to wring out washcloths they are also a nice large size so many of the thicker washcloths can only be used once or maybe twice because they cannot be wrung out properly the colors of the towels are also beautiful i'm buying more for our guest bathroom thank goodness i searched on amazon i do n't believe these wonderful martex new splendor items are sold anywhere else	20

1	the refill accessory \( in both 50 and 70 oz sizes \) definitely cuts the refill maintenance in half since it doubles the capacity you only refill half as often you still have to clean the fountain regularly as recommended a different reviewer mentioned that the clear reservoir is not dishwasher safe and that warning is stated quite clearly in the manual throwing caution to the wind i ignored the warning and now have an oddly shaped container that with some squeezing still works as expected	20
1	saw a demo of this at a local sur la table and very impressed the coffee it makes is outstanding i plan to buy one later this year amazon is being deceptive about price they state list price is 2400 and they 're selling it for 1798 95 at a savings of 601 05 not ! look at the jura capresso website the list for the impressa f9 is 1799 that brings amazon 's big discount down to a whole 0 05 the higher end impressa s9 is 2399 \( and amazon claims it is 3200 \) do your research do n't trust amazon 's claims for msrp	20

1	let me preface my review by saying that i am a 25 year old woman who is n't really big on doing chores i got a dyson for christmas and just tried out the dusting brush last week my immediate reaction was this is genius ! it is great for dusting computers televisions lampshades bookcases \( mine are unfinished wood with several crevices so normal dusting never seemed to help \) the tops of books cd organizers ceiling fan blades metal bedframes i have dusted so many things with the dyson attachment and it works beautifully this attachment will not disappoint trust me it 's already made my life so much easier and cleaner	20
1	we bought this canister set to compliment the stoneware we purchased from the same set i am especially impressed with the seal used on these canisters you would swear it is mechanical the lids open easily yet seal tight when simply placing the lid on the canister they are very high quality and look much better than the stainless steel ones we were considering before finding these recommended	20

1	the glasses are nice quality but like the majority of other people who ordered these they arrived broken because of insufficient packing material you would think someone at amazon would fix the problem instead of shipping these over and over again	20
1	bought this opener because i was tired of trying to open tall cans with an average size electric opener not only does it open cans that are taller but it does it with ease locks on can top stays on through entire cycle my last opener would often get half way through the can and miss spot before juming off track not this one ! i am very pleased	20

1	luigi bormioli has proven to me that they possess the exceptional quality of service that i would like to be able to expect from all vendors when my product arrived broken from shipment amazone com would not replace it due to the fact that it was past their deadline i contacted the luigi bormioli company and they were heappy to replace the broken glasses when they arrived however they were the wrong glasses i returned them to the company along with the broken glasses i had received to be sure they sent the correct glasses again they happily sent new glasses and even included a few extra in case any broke in shipment again i would highly recommend these glasses and this company	20

1	i recently purchased this double boiler and i am very happy with it it is a good quality stainless and that is important i love the vintage style it is a satin finish and has an interesting shape much like one that grandma had many years ago the boiler insert is 6 deep not counting the lid and perfect for making frosting candy custard anything that requires gentle cooking	20

1	this soup tureen and bowls are the greatest i use them a lot and just throw them in the dishwasher great value	20
1	does it look and feel cheap \? yes ! does it do exactly what i expect it to \? \( make coffee automatically at a pre programmed time in the morning \) yes ! i 've used it to make coffee before i wake up every morning for almost a month though the design of the pot itself is pretty bad \( i kinda expect it to break or otherwise fail sooner or later \) it 's done the job so far and i ca n't complain	20
1	i really like these glasses they are attractive and pleasant to hold i prefer having a wine glass that does n't contain a lot of wine which is why i got these since they are the smallest in this line	20
1	i planted these last wed it is now tues and i think by tommorow i will be able to harvest they grow so fast you ca n't believe it when i wake up they look like they have grown so much by the time i go to bed they are even bigger ! ! it was very easy to plant and all i do is make sure they have water there is a chance you can get mold but i have not had that problem i will buy more from this seller ! i am looking into the mushroom kits	20
1	i purchased this item last christmas and have used it to airate many red wines i have had no issues with the decanture being delicate infact we machine wash it after each use the only issue i have had is when we first recieved the decanture we had difficulty placing the dacanture in the stand correctly other than that it is a wonderfully stylish piece of glassware when not being used and a quality redwine decanture	20
1	this is truly a great waffle maker to have if you have kids they love to eat them and make their own	20
1	i like this pan because of the tapered shape it cooks sauces without boiling over because it is tall and it sits perfectly on the small burner with no overlap for even heating the handles stay cool and the clean up is easy beautiful exterior also like all all clad products this pan is worth the money long lasting and well designed the only thing i wish all clad would add is hash marks on the interior so i could see when i have reduced a sauce to half	20

1	these glasses are perfect for keeping drinks colder or warmer and the best part is you do n't feel the temperture on the outside nor do you have condensation from the differences between inside and outside tempeture	20
1	i have tried many different coffee makers and being a coffee junkie i keep looking for the combination of simplicity cost and excellent coffee this has all three ! the first two or three times i tried this the coffee did n't come out that good either too weak or not enough body but now i have it down and the coffee is excellent i make a double espresso and then add in extra water to fill my travel mug for my 2 hour commute each day the other good news i 've now found a good use for my single cup coffee maker it produce the right amount of water at the right temprature to use in the aeroexpress	20
1	a good way to make a cup of coffee particularly good if you want a fresh brewed taste but do n't need to brew a full pot for only one or two people can be stored in a cabinet or drawer eliminating the use of counter space a must have for small kitchens	20
1	high quality soft and absorbent large all cotton bath sheets areexactly as described and really hold up in laundering and usage great items	20
1	great ! i love it ! ! goes great with my kitchen	20
1	this is a massive skillet ! be warned it 's heavy but the handle and front grip help a lot when food is in the pan it 's preseasoned right out of the box and with a bit of care and extra seasoning this pan is great i would have liked a cover to prevent grease splatter but the high walls on the side help keep some of the splatter down	20
1	i like the style weight and size of this set but i'm not sure how it is going to hold up in the dishwasher i 've had it about a month and am starting to see some rust like spots on some of the pieces like have been mentioned in other reviews we 'll see if they get worse	20
1	aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the '4' setting it 's pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it 's warmed up \( keep it closed \) i modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what i do sure they occasionally stick and i do n't always get the batter in right and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it 's on but this is n't a 100 device it 's just a nice little waffle maker	20
1	i use this in my 29 gallon and the filter is excellent the best part about it is the ability to control the amount of water brought in it is also very quiet however when the power goes out and comes back on it wo n't begin working again you must add water to it to get it up and running this has been a problem when i 've gone on vacation and i 've come home to cloudy water the refills are also pretty expensive and can get a bit messy it 's all worth it though it keeps my tank in nice condition	20
1	locally one box of 5 runs about 2 3 of the cost of this case lot of 5 boxes a terrific savings	20
1	everything about our miele \( red velvet \) vacuumn cleaner is top notch including the bags the nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag this prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner this is just a small detail but it exemplifies the thought that goes into this company 's products	20
1	i 've had the grind and brew for almost 3 years and have never had any problems it makes great coffee it 's not that hard to clean and it has adjustable settings for temperature and coffee strength so if you fiddle with it a little you can get it to make exactly the coffee you want i gave one to my cousin a couple of years ago as well and it turned him into a total coffee addict	20
1	excellent value towels ! wash first so absorbantcy is best right away blue color is gorgeous	20
1	i really like the electric skillet it is the first one i have bought it is big enough to fry a chicken cut in half both halves at once and deep enough to make a stew easy to clean just like promised the only thing i was not so happy about was the handles they give a lot they bend and one of mine is already broken but that is really the only complain i have and i consider it a minor and would buy the skillet again	20
1	i love this it keeps the bed toasty i takes some time to warm up the bed i turn it to 5 and leave it there for an hour when i get it it 's very nice and i turn it down to 1 or 2 i find if i keep it on 5 all night i roast i do prefer this product to an electric blanket it has n't made a noticable impact on my electricity bills and it was worth the purchase price if you have a big pillowtop mattress the pad does n't quite fit like a generously sized fitted sheet otherwise i would have given the product 5 stars	20
1	works great i purchase 3 one for my husband and 2 more for my children good design however it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a blackberry an ipod and a gameboy the station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time	20
1	it 's not the most amazing space saving contraption in the world but it works definitely helps reduce clutter	20
1	i 've been wanting a knife sharpener for decades but just could n't justify spending over one hundred dollars on one when wa la i discovered the wusthof 2904 model on amazon ! it 's so easy to use and while the scissor sharpener does take some practice it 's wonderful to have useable kitchen shears and regular scissors once again ! sheryl california	20
1	this is a fine dehyrator it 's quick and powerful the description says the trays are 13 5 inches but that text was lifted from the description for the fd 50 60 this model \( fd 1010 \) has 15 25 inch trays which adds almost one square foot to the area of the 13 5 inch tray multiply those larger trays by 30 \( the maximum capacity \) and you got a huge amount of drying surface	20
1	i was a little hesitant to spend over 10 for a splatter screen as most of them really are n't worth more than a few bucks however i am very glad that i spent the extra money on this one the quality of this item is top notch it 's much more sturdy than any others that i 've seen i 've been using this splatter screen for a few months now and still love it the feet on the bottom are very helpful in controlling messes the handle is terrific \( some screens only have either a d ring on the top or a thin handle \) and seems to stay cool while in use this even got raves from my mother	20
1	this machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well the fan is very quiet i like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well my only complaint is that the blue lcd that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is very bright too bright for a bedroom really lights it up i 'll be looking for some way of safely masking it otherwise very nice but hope it lasts	20
1	i needed a canister vacuum that was n't too expensive that did a decent job on my hardwood and laminate floors this vacuum worked out well all we had was an upright and it just did n't cut it for our floors this turned out to be a good product for the price	20
1	i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right	20
1	this mill performs as promised and is beautiful to boot i would expect to pay much more for such a product the grind is even and consistent the appearance is sleek and modern yet classic i would highly recommend this mill and will consider buying another in the future as a gift	20

1	this dish rack fits into small spaces and holds a decent capacity of plates etc perfect for a small apartment kitchen ! love it !	20
1	since i have been pleased with my t fal pressure cooker i purchased this pan based on the quality of craftsmanship i like this pan for frying its stainless steel with the thick aluminum heat diffuser bottom makes it robust \( it is warp free \) other aluminum pans tend to warp over time the nonstick surface seems to be less prone to scratches however i always recommend non metallic utensils for piece of mind the center heat indicator is helpful to know when it 's ready	20
1	i wish i had gotten one of these a long time ago easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses my wife can even use it without burning stuff which she admits is a feat for her so she uses it several times a week too it holds heat well cleans up easy and the lip on the corner works great for draining only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove with gas you should be fine it has n't seemed to effect the performance though and for the money it is quite perfect	20
1	i just received this griddle today and am so disappointed to find on the small print on the box \( and not in amazon 's description ! \) that this griddle can not be used on ceramic top stoves it 's a beautiful piece of cookware heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges exactly what i wanted but very unfortunate that amazon does n't tell you that it wo n't work with some stoves the warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top probably would have given it 5 stars if i could have used it	20
1	i have a manual sharpener but in reality almost never use it the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no brainer there 's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull for most knives the fine and polishing grinder works just great if you have inexpensive knives the coarse grinder will chew them up but if you have well made knives the waring will work well i 've had good success with the waring	20
1	very nice warm blanket but too big for a full size bed way too big	20
1	very well made a quality item works just as described in booklet	20
1	my daughter used this set and now my son uses it we threw out the fork by mistake so i'm ordering another set the fork is just perfect for a toddler but my almost 6 year old still loves the fork i 'd highly recommend this	20
1	i bought this heater to head my bedroom finished basement the room is 16'x21' with 9 food ceilings the heater does a fantastic job at heating the room though takes a while \( 1 hour \) to do so which is fine with me i really like the fact that it is dead quiet and has a convienent lcd timer my only complaint is that it is rather large long	20
1	we have finished our basement and have a home theater room which is on the cool side we bought this heater to warm up the room and it works great	20
1	i was lucky to get the stainless popper on clearance it is wonderful we have used it for several months now it is so fast and the pop corn is like movie theatre pop corn i am so disappointed that target is not carrying the stainless model anymore my college children who do n't live at home want their own even my daughter who had not been a popcorn fan i'm sorry to hear about problems with the all aluminum models when i bought mine i chose stainless because i knew it could handle the high heat well and of course the bottom can go in the dishwasher hey target how about carrying the stainless model again \?	20
1	i bought a few of these collars out of desperation in the past my cats got out of any kind of safety collar within an hour of putting them on since i was moving recently i was especially afraid of the cats getting lost during the move or at our new home i bought these collars because of the reviews and everything that the other reviewers say is true the only thing i 'll add is that one of my cats managed to chew through his collar over the course of several months but it 's still the only kind i 'll use for him at this price i can easily afford replacements	20
1	we had our kitchen gutted and completely redone i built a knife holder to use in a drawer now with the wusthof 25 slot i have removed my home made holder the drawer can be used to store other items i can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years there is no need to buy a lot of new knives just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use you ca n't go wrong with this super storage block	20
1	looks great just what i wanted i ca n't believe i have filled it up already \( i feel like such a chef	20
1	it was nice to be able to purchase just one mug the delivery was quick	20
1	for big birds rib roasts etc you need a long knife to get a clean even slice this knife delivers it has great lines and a ballanced feel the forged blade is thin and flexible yet still drives from the handle the blade follows your directions well and does n't wander during a cut a real gem with top quality construction i'm a big fan of three rivet durability but these contemporary handles look and feel so good that i chose them for the last three knives i purchased blade for blade these knives are the best around at this price you can build a lifetime set in months istead of years	20
1	although it has two prongs to do two shapes at the same time i had problems with the cookies sticking together so i would recommend only using one mold at a time	20
1	buy some rechargable batteries \( 4 aa 's \) and you 're set ! this fan has saved me time and time again at work when a hot flash hits just having some airflow around my face seems to help it 's not a whirlwind but just enough	20
1	i got tired of dragging out my trusty box grater to do small jobs like grating nutmeg ginger or parmagiana reggiano so i picked this little gem up it feels good in your hand \( no surprise there it 's what oxo is known for \) is well made and cleans up beautifully every time it is so easy now just to grab this guy and grate what needs to be grated that i find i am using whole spices more and more grab yourself one of these you 'll love it	20

1	good cooker very functional works well been using it for a year and never had a problem	20
1	being used to the swiftness of the roomba \( 10 stars ! \) the scooba seems very slow it does not follow the wall as much as the roomba but at the end of the cycle the floor is clean and sweet smelling on the downside my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so i have to put up barriers to keep the scooba on the hard surface only in rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine	20
1	ice bucket is smaller than i expected otherwise a very good product	20
1	not much to be said about this product just watch for a low price and then stock up	20

1	i absolutely adore these kyocera knives they are the sharpest things i have ever seen i ordered this through witbecks and the first one got lost in the mail that can always happen when i contacted matt witbeck he responded immediately \( that night from home \) and the next day sent me a replacement i have never had such prompt and unquestioning customer service and so i want to recommend witbecks to anyone	20

1	used for a month now better than the others tried over 25 yrs for the remanufactured price would buy it again if it lasts for a yr	20
1	this fan is incredibly powerful it can definitely move air around a room my one call out is that there is almost no difference between low and medium i do n't know if it 's just mine that is that way or not and it is n't a big deal since i bought it to ease the air conditioner bill and i 'll tell ya when you want to cool a room this fan does it with out remorse	20
1	i just got into wine a little while ago and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler but seeing as how i'm anywhere near wine snob status i did n't want to spend a bunch on a set enter the riedel o glasses they were on sale great price for two glasses they arrived and i'm happy with them they 're sophisticated enough to be wine glasses but without the stems they 're not snobby either i would have given this 5 stars but one of the glasses i received has a minor imperfection along the rim almost a little bubble of glass or crystal other than that they 're great	20
1	pros towels are good in quality absorb water very well decent in length soft cons have lint coming off when trying to wipe wet skin still need to put it through a wash to see if it leeches colour	20
1	the picture in the ad does n't do these pots and pans justice they are very very shining and heat evenly and fast	20
1	i bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class valentine 's day party it was the talk of the whole school the kids loved it i used sephra chocolate \( a coupon was included \) so i did n't have to mess with adding any oil the chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression the cascading flowing chocolate was n't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box but it probably would have if i would have added a teenie bit of oil but the pure sephra chocolate tasted devine i also saved 25 00 by buying the chp \( champaigne color \) version	20
1	this towels are probably what most would expect they look nice and have become my preferred kitchen towel i cook alot i would look elsewhere if they were used primarily for drying dishes as they are n't extremely absorbant	20
1	when i was looking to purchase a new machine i only was looking for a bunn bunn makes the best coffee machines none can compare every diner coffee house and dunkin' donuts only use bunn machines the a10 is one great machine ! brews perfect cups of coffee hot and quickly everyone in my office is very happy with the unit if you 're a serious coffee drinker please do n't cheap out on a mr coffee braun or krupps frankly they cannot brew coffee at the speed temperature or taste of a bunn unit i bought the a10 to replace a bunn unit that i used for 10 years without a glitch	20
1	i really like this bookcase it is attractive and easy to set up simply fold the shelves into place although it is easy to set up it is pretty sturdy there are spaces in the back that items could fall through but there are wood slats to hold books in place i also like the size of the bookcase it is not too wide but holds a lot because it is tall and the mission sides are nice	20
1	the picture on the website really does n't do them any justice they are beautiful and tough and i'm so glad i got them	20
1	i have found this to be the best i have ever owned my daughter had gotten one and finally my old one conked out and i just had to have a bunn also i envied my daughter 's ability to make coffee in literally three minutes i used to only have 12 cup capacity pots but there is no need for it now the best is that you can always have a fresh cup of coffee and it is always hot it makes a clean cup of coffee easily and efficiently we are thrilled with this product and highly recommend it anyone and everyone this will be our brand of coffee maker forever	20
1	this is a big saucepan ! i got it for christmas because i needed a large saucepan shape with a long handle to make pralines this has become my favorite pot for many things from cooking pasta to whipping up a large pot of chili on a cold night the see through lid is great for monitoring food as it 's cooking and the second loop handle gives stability when carrying and pouring it is traditional calphalon quality with a modern look and i love it	20

1	you would never know it was reconditioned it is probably even better than new plus being dishwasher friendly makes even easier to use	20
1	i would have given it 5 stars but my gerbils chewed the house up within a week or two and now after a couple of months they no longer have ramps currently they 're working on chewing up the shelves so i'm off to buy one that 's entirely wire wish i had done that in the first place	20

1	the my pod and its filters work great in my senseo now i do n't have to buy the expensive pods all the time the only problem is i have to shut it off manually as it wo n't sense it is full and shut itself off	20
1	hunter fan arrived in 2 days from amazon com and immediately i noticed the weight of the fan heavy just the way i like it unpacked this beauty and plugged her in and off she went with a beautiful sound i love the 3 wing blade and the speed variation is great from barely running to blow your hat off we love it keep up the good work hunter i intend to buy one for a christmas gift also	20
1	this is a great product it comes with clips for a shoulder strap but no strap that is the only thing left wanting	20

1	i was very pleased with how quick i received my purchase i had looked for a long time for bunny cake pan	20
1	i have used patton air circulators for the last twenty years and if you are looking for something much more effecient thanthe common box fan that you see in department stores this isreally a fan the first one i bought had the c f m rating onit which was 9600 they do n't put that on the fan anymore but it is a three speed fan that will really circulate someair and can be adjusted to blow straight up nothing i haveseen even comes close for the money	20
1	they are n't kidding this thing is razor sharp it needed no tuning up before i used it for the first time the handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight which is unfortunate because i like the weight for chopping but the hollow edge design is wonderful the mushrooms and onions i sliced up were thin as paper and did n't stick to the blade i 'd recommend it	20
1	the cheaper ones do n't quite fit unfortunate because these are so expensive which is why i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars i would give five for the product but the price really is outrageous they know choice is limited so they gouge their own customers \( hamilton beach not amazon \) too bad the makers of these machines do n't have the users in mind instead of their bank accounts they take advantage of people who need these humidifiers	20
1	this mattress pad fits my cali king mattress perfectly and the quality is exceptional i highly recommend it	20
1	this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb chickens it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck the pan looks good from oven to table yes it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron but i'm really glad to add this to my pantry	20
1	my husband was skeptical why do you need a new 200 pot he said well i bought the dutch oven with two days of receiving it i made the best beef stew he has ever had he said the meat was much more tender than when i make the stew in a crock pot never again will he question me when i say i need a kitchen tool	20
1	i have two of these in my home and they really help to cut down on smells and dander from our two cats and the filters are inexpensive enough to be able to change regularly	20
1	we are really good about packing up our meat vegis and fruit right after purchase our vacuum sealer has saved us tons of money just from not tossing out stuff that goes bad quickly the sealer came with rolls to make our own bags but i found it too cumbersome these bags eliminate the difficulty	20
1	this tea kettle is simply devine to use no cords in the way no waiting for water to boil just let it sit on your kitchen counter and it 's all automatic looks beautiful as well i 've purchased many as gifts and have one at home and one on the boat thanks cuisinart for this product	20
1	i'm puzzled by the several reviews that say the filter gets moldy too fast i am replacing my first filter after about a year because it has built up deposits of lime i never noticed any mold	20
1	i loved my hamilton beach unit and when i got use to the small about of noise that did not bother me dusting was way down and now that my unit has stopped working i notice a big big difference in the dust and my allergies i have no idea why it stopped working after only having it for 3 years but it did anyone else have this problem	20
1	i recieved this rack for christmas and i love it it looks great and my 4 year old daughter likes to use it too the only thing i do n't like is that it only holds 50 dvds and 2 racks look nice but any more than that is gonna look dumb i also like that the drawers pull out and sit on top for easy viewing	20
1	i spray my foods with olive oil using this wonderful sprayer it 's great to use if you want to avoid the unhealthy chemicals you get in the spray cans off the shelf just poor in your favourite olive oil	20
1	works great ! easy to pump it would be nice if there were a clear window to let you know when you need to refill	20
1	nice machine for doing quick clean ups stairs and car a bit heavy but great suction not thrilled with the method in which the hose for accessories is hooked up but a small price to pay for a good job worth the minor frustration	20
1	very nice peeler except it 's missing a feature that every other peeler i 've ever seen has a protuberance that can be used to remove the eyes from potatoes	20
1	this was the second highest rated bundt pan in cook 's illustrated i used an oil flour baking spray and my bundt cake popped out with ease it 's lightweight but perfect for me since i only use it a few times a year	20
1	cooking is actually a pleasure when you have tools that are as colourful and cheerful as this little pot it is just beautiful to look at and a joy to use \( i never thought i could get so excited about a simple pot ! \) this little green pepper cooks evenly in the oven or the stovetop and clean up is a breeze i 've use this to make casseroles for 2 4 sides for 4 6 even soups and sauces jambalaya is one dish particularly well suited for this pot straight from simmering on the stove to the table it 's gorgeous i'm planning to get the tomato or pumpkin next	20
1	this cute little casserole is great for making soups or casseroles for 2 4 people i use it for my morning oatmeal soup for lunch and casseroles for dinner retains heat so foods stay warm clean up is a breeze ! i have the green pepper but want the red and yellow one too	20
1	our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this the lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute these sheets have held up well so far and feel great if you get the ruby color make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs	20
1	sheets are great just the lace on top can be bothersome when sleepin	20
1	it is big and heavy but a real workhorse mixes things we would only do by hand before	20
1	this bowl is shallow enough to serve from and deep enough to really load it up i use mine constantly and did n't think i would when i bought it we reach for this ahead of all the other bowls and platters i own i love my fiestaware you ca n't go wrong with these durable and colorful dishes	20
1	when i got this i was a little worried it would be too cheapy b c the materials are light weight but i set to putting it together and the directions were very easy and all the pieces were there and when i got done i was estatic it was just so easy and looked so good ! i have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer unlike other reviewers i find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts	20
1	i am a boy when i bouhgt this stuff it was the first time live without my family i do not know the cookwre set but my female friends always say where did get it \? or it look really expensive they alway said it 's good and reasonable price	20
1	i was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but i gave this set a try and love it the pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable clean up is a breeze i am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces	20
1	i recomend this item highly can be washed without fear of water inside and can be inside the oven while cooking works like a charm mik	20
1	this maker pours well and has a soft handle we actually found one at a department store so we were able to see it in person before ordering it online nice little coffee make	20
1	i consider this coffee pot to be near perfect it has no auto turn on feature but i never use that anyway the only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens but it soon becomes habit my favorite feature has to be the water filter it really improves the coffee flavor it 's also compact i gained a little more counter space	20
1	i like these knives very sharp and a value for the money long term who knows i 've had mine a little over a year and completely satisfied	20
1	i threw out all of my old tupperware cups that my kids were using and switched to a supply of fiestaware ceramic cups now that my kids are all over 5 we do n't need all that ugly plastic these are durable and attractive a range of colors lets them keep track of which cup is theirs plus it matches my other dinnerware it 's the perfect size for them when they get older and need a bigger glass these are perfect for juice	20
1	i recently purchased the sakura embossed palm 16 pc dinnerware set for my mom for christmas she absolutely loves them they are so unique and when she has company over for dinner gets many compliments on them nobody has ever seen dinnerware like these before she is a big fan of palm trees and these fit her collection nicely	20
1	bought this product with a gift certificate from my children i am very satisfied with the bowls i give this product a high recommendation	20
1	i got this for my mother and i was n't too sure about the color i had originally wanted a darker color but this arrived and was such an excellent product my mother loves and when i seen it on her bed it made me want one this is one of the best deals i have gotten on amazon love it	20
1	this was such a great deal and i love this duvet cover it is so soft and looks so stylish on our bed i just wish is had a matching bed ruffle my husband even likes it and that takes a lot the color is rich and goes with so much	20
1	item shipped lightening fast ! in perfect condition ! just as describe	20
1	i wish that i had purchased the sheet set earlier so that i could have enjoyed them all winter they are so comfortable even with flannel pj 's i did n't have any problem turning over i completely recommend this sheet	20
1	i overheard a flight attendant raving about the neckbones and also saw it reviewed highly in shape magazine i still have not tried it in the car or on a flight but am excited to it does feel comfortable though is bigger than expected so pay attention to the dimensions before you buy	20
1	this mug absolutely comes through as promised hot beverages stay hot even hours later it 's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning i am very pleased with this purchase ! the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it 's size i would have preferred something a little wider but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for unfortunately it tends to move around in mine but it does n't spill any thing	20
1	this cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy it heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before it also heats very evenly the only negative thing i have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon however i think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or pam fixes the problem	20
1	finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction ! i have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived the suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned the hepa filter means you really ca n't smell that you 've been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change also who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner \? hey if you have to own one would n't you prefer to have one that 's easy on the eye \?	20
1	the first time i used this waffle maker i was very disappointed and regretted the purchase however i gave it another chance the second time i used the recipe that came with the instructions and the waffles turned out great my husband said they were even better than the ones i used to make to avoid the waffle breaking when lifting them out i lift part of the waffle slightly with a knife and slide a round wire rack under it	20
1	i see all the reviews agree it is loud but i love it i was able to sleep with it on hi speed but can see how it would disturb some people it is very powerful great for the bedroom i often wake up hot or cold in the middle of the night the four speeds remote control are very convenient	20
1	i only gave this product 4 stars because my daughter has n't slept in it yet but i set it up and it was super easy almost one touch set up it is firm yet comfortable and the super soft fleece cover is awesome it has moons and stars on it the take down was 5 minutes if that it 's small enough to fit almost anywhere and deep enough so that a toddler \( my daughter is 2 \) will not roll off \) love it and i know i will be using it often	20
1	i bought a pack of 3 for my purifier this filter does a good job and keeps the watrer tasting good	20
1	this is the nicest pie dish i 've ever seen i dont even make pies but i got it to use for serving or to make casseroles or even to use for baking miscellaneous things it 's diameter is bigger than average and deeper too the color is deep and rich i got the cobalt i will find a place to display this dish it 's so pretty got one for my friend too she loves it as much as i do at 20 00 and free shipping you gotta try this ! maybe i 'll even try a pie	20
1	not only do these burgundian clay pie pans look wonderful they also bake the most perfect pies i have ever put together the crusts come out even and just that great combo of crisp yet tender and flaky i use martha 's pate brisee recipe but with these pans it is foolproof ! i have the big one for meat pies and 2 of the regular size for sweet pies and quiches wonderful	20

1	we have total enjoyed the margaritaville maker we have discovered many normal drinks taste great when you mix them in this blender if you are into the creamy \( i e baileys \) drinks they are lighter and more enjoyable we are very happy we purchased this	20
1	this miniature pot is decorative as well as utilitarian since it can be used on the flame for melting butter or small amounts of sauces	20
1	the plastic top has no vents thereby producing rubbery boiled tasting popcorn easily solved ! i drilled about a dozen 1 8 inch holes in the top \( bottom \? \) of the plastic bowl and voila ! wonderful crispy crunchy popcorn	20
1	i got this to replace my bulky turner that i got from the dollar store for 1 00 for an extra 3 or so i got this lovely turner that gets under pancakes and eggs and also teases my belgium waffles out the waffle maker for me also the turner part looks plastic but i guess it 's silicone or something because it does not melt also you can wash it in the dishwasher in the hottest heat if washing by hand its easily washable too ! i have both the blue and green flashy colors so it is easily spottable in my kitchen	20
1	this is my first grill pan and it work very well i have only cooked chicken on it so far and i have found that i like the way tenders cook better then really thick chicken breasts	20
1	i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought they hold an edge well and have a good balance the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives the only problem with the set is the steel hone i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife that is the only detractor from the set	20
1	i had bought my first fiestaware cereal bown sight unseen from amazon com and i absolutely love the rich cinnamon color of cinnabar ! the cereal bowl comes in handy and we use it for hot and cold cereal soup ice cream and leftovers \( smaller portions \) it 's microwaveable too ! if you 've never used fiestaware before this would be a great introduction to the line especially if you have use for smaller soup cereal bowls	20
1	i too have an electric stove i'm glad others mentioned that ! cooks nicely cleans up easily absolutely love it great price too	20
1	ever since my curlers arrived i have been obsessed i love the curls i get from the larger size just roll your hair when you wake up do your make eat breakfast and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers \( very painless \) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials i love this product ! ! !	20
1	my son who lives in washington uses these fans exclusively for air conditioning his house in the summer we live in california but bought this fan to help vent our computer room which gets way too hot in the summer despite air conditioning because it either brings air in or vents air out and is thermostatically controlled it works great we plan on buying 3 more next summer to keep our air conditioning bill down	20
1	the product came in a slightly damaged plastic cover pouch there was a smudged dirty smear across the damaged pouch area which came out with laundering other than that the sheets are great the lace needs starch and ironing the fitted sheet fits over two twin beds that are made for individual remote adjustment positions of the mattresses these two beds are put together to make a king bed this product was a christmas gift and it was well received	20
1	i have always used the metal irons and was concerned about the nonstick i was afraid the structure would create thicker pizzelles which are more cookie like versus light and wafer the first ones came out and were sticking to the surface i was disheartened thinking i am having the same problem as with the metal i switched to nonstick to avoid this oh well try again and from that moment on was smooth sailing i like the light indicator on this model the easy clean up storage design just everything	20
1	the pizzelle baker performed very well the batches of pizzelles were excellent and the recipes included were good i recommend this pizzelle iron	20
1	very loud and heavy i have used lighter and less noisy vacuums in the past this one does pick up hair and lint very well seems to deep clean for the price it was a good deal	20
1	its a great product ! good quality not enough velco \( sp \) for the bumpers my bulldog takes them right off	20
1	very satisfied with the system makes water tastes go away water should not have a taste at all and brita makes it that way	20
1	appears to be their regular coffeemaker except a thermal carafe is substituted for the glass one and watch out for that hot plate burner ! it 's a bit tough on the fingers if you were n't expecting the carafe to be heated basically this is a good coffeemaker just not quite worth the price tag for that amount of money i expected something more	20
1	i just love my new multi tasking opener i have arthritis and it was difficult to open jars and this has been a life saver	20
1	i'm glad we went back to braun for a coffee maker tried a few others but they were n't as good braun makes a hot good cup of java faster than most i do wish they would go back to the 12 cup pot	20
1	i really enjoy cooking in this pot it has lots of space and is great for all kinds of dishes the enamel surface is wonderful i love to cook a dish in the pot and serve from it at the table when its just the family the only drawback is how heavy the pot is but that does n't change the fact this is my favorite and now most used pot in my kitchen !	20
1	the best buy i have ever found on 1000 count sheets ! they are excellent quality	20
1	i burned up countless lesser spatulas before i found this one try as i might i can not damage it not even in cast iron cookware get one and see for yourself	20

1	they have the crackle one expects from a percale sheet refreshing as the snap of a breeze hitting sailing canvas a man 's kind of sheet	20
1	this platter is much nicer than i was expecting larger too the glaze technique really looks beautiful on this piece and it will make a nice addition to my table setting it is well made without being overly heavyit came well packaged and arrived only 3 days after i placed my order with the free shipping thanks amazon for having the companion pieces i ca n't seem to find in any department store	20
1	this has got to be the greatest little heater the only problem that i had was getting it to stop beeping when you change a setting other than that i really like the remote and use this in my office at work	20
1	we bought two santas and two pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at amazon they were the best gifts we gave immediate hits with each couple one in their late 50 's one in the mid 20 's in each case the response was the same it 's like my childhood they are going in the living room each season vivid but soft these are superb decorations	20

1	we bought this waffle maker because the american ones are hard to find and this one got great reviews so given that we prefer american waffles to belgian waffles we still like this waffle maker ok very easy to clean and definitely non stick	20
1	i was a little worried about buying a reconditioned ice cream maker but when it arrived it was just like brand new including all original packing perfect i was also afraid that it would be too underpowered to freeze the sorbets and ice creams adequately but again it was quite strong in this regard and froze the mixtures perfectly admittedly does n't make a huge amount but the convenience of not having to constantly add ice cubes and salt in the old wooden tub machine more than makes up for it and it 's way quieter than the old fashioned freezers also it was half the price of a new one buy it !	20
1	this is a killer machine it is a little noisey but well worth the small inconvience i have been using this for three weeks and am lovin i	20
1	a great ice cream maker no prefreezing bowls it is loud so plan your ice cream making accordingly you will not want to be in the same room as this thing when it is going unless you are already deaf lol ! the price of this remanufactured unit along with the amazon discount running at the time brought it to 125 with no shipping fees try to get that on ebay ! this unit stays on my countertop at all times and attracts much interest from visitors the ice cream is wonderful i recommend ben and jerry 's cookbook and a good ice cream scoop replacement parts can be found on the manufacturer 's website and are reasonably priced	20
1	these are good quality sheets they are a bit narrow compared to what i'm used to i 've used them everyday for about 2 months now and there are no scratches and they clean up super easy still	20
1	as everyone else has indicated programming is n't intuitive the opening was larger than necessary and my cats learned to stick their paws up inside the machine to steal more food within a few days we blocked off half of the food shute by using two very small screws and heavy duty plastic and the cats were no longer able to sneak food between feedings prior to using this feeder the cats would wake us up at the crack of dawn crying for food now they associate feedings with the machine and leave us to sleep in peace ! well worth the money for us ! !	20
1	i collect both old and new fiesta ware and was thrilled to see the vibrant new sunflower yellow dinnerware the color is wonderful much darker and more golden than the quot old quot yellow this bowl particularly is nice because it is not too deep your dinner guests can see your favorite dish because it holds two quarts there 's plenty to serve very lovely product that is easy to take care of	20
1	i started to order replacement filters at 47 99 \( too expensive \) but found the whole machine was on sale for only 49 99 so i got 3 spare machines i 'll be looking for one with a washable filter before those need replacement by the way they do remove dust and pollen and the like and i'm happy with their performance	20

1	i was shopping in a gift store today and came across this tovolo tea infuser and it is brillant ! if you do n't use tea bags and are used to the infuser on a chain this will spoil you it stirs like a spoon and when you are done it sits in its craddle so that it does n't drip on anything and the whole thing is dishwasher safe i paid more than 9 95 for mine too	20
1	i have never used any other dehydrator 's and found this very simple to use clean store and the price was great plus it makes my house smell great when i'm using it so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i'm finding it enjoyable to use	20
1	the grinders perform exactly as described they are attractive and i would recommend them highly	20
1	this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces however once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware you 'll want to buy more over the years i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well known commercial cookware brand but all clad is far superior the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well balanced making them very easy to handle they heat evenly and cook uniformly even over low and medium heat i am very pleased with all clad 's performance on my radiant cooktop i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance well worth every penny	20

1	i 've owned one for five years and my knives are razor sharp it took me a little practice before i realized i was using it correctly though the directions could be better and the machine does n't provide any feedback to distinguish proper sharpening cooks illustrated magazine found that they could get knives sharper with this device than with the higher end models	20
1	i just bought my second one the first alarm hangs in our kitchen and does go off with a nice loud alarm when i seriously scorch dinner it 's easy to turn off with the huge button in front no false alarms here only goes off when there is smoke nearby	20
1	i got a good deal on this and it turned out to much better than expected well made with a sharp edge that holds up the only reason for a 4 is the handle is not the most comfortable or secure grip	20
1	this food processor is the most powerful and quietest that i have ever used i am very impressed with the material the bowl and lid are made of the ones i have been using for the last 15 years have not been comparable in the least	20
1	i bought a bed a few months ago and had to go out and buy new bedding at some local stores i hated having to shop around and wish i would have seen a set like this because i went from a queen bed to a king size i had to buy new pillows mattress pad comforter sheets etc i looked around and if you add up the pieces in the 10 piece set its a great value plus much easier to buy all at once i highly recommend this set for anyone upgrading their mattress i was not able to buy the king size set but did buy a twin set for my niece as a back to school gift cheers ! ste	20

1	this is our first juicer and we are have a great time juicing everything we use it a lot with our smoothie maker it is designed well and is very easy to clean it does drip a bit for a while from the spout but that is n't a problem at all we got this because we have a 2 year old and a 16 year old we wanted to make it easy to give them great tasting sweets that are good for them my 16 year old son loves apple juice and makes it all the time now no more soda in our house !	20

1	miele makes a great vacuum and this is one for sure but i want to recommend the seller witbecks wonderfully personalized and caring service from someone whose last name is actually witbecks when dhl screwed up their delivery \( an immensely crappy organization but that 's another story \) he stepped in and sent another unit without delay terrific guy terrific price terrific service	20
1	these tables are great i bought two of them solid wood classic design that will still look good in 10 years and easy no fuss assembly all this at a great price pick one up	20
1	the step stool a gift for my daughter works well as a step stool the problem was in the difficulty to attach the seat and back to the stool the frame did not meet and had to be bent to align the screws there was a hole in the box and the screws fell out so my daughter had to request the screws before she could put it together	20
1	i used this skillet for the first time and it was great i love cast iron but the enamel coating sure made this easier to use it cleaned quickly and required no seasoning also its a really pretty skillet the sellers were really good also about emailing with order status updates shipping info and the skillet came quickly through fed ex very good customer service	20
1	a very nice blender it crushes and purees just about anything i 've had it for three years now and it is still in great condition and still very powerful very loud ! you might need ear protection as you use this i often turn it on leave the room do something else and come back in when i think it is done ! i'm not kidding !	20

1	very quick and good coffee as long as you buy the proprietary pods which can be found on line usually with free shipping	20
1	great pot i'm annoyed at having to press the unlock button everytime the one that prevents accidental spills the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes i'm used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top in hindsight i should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differencesi'm also really annoyed at the shipping bought through amazon it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in which was n't up for the rigors of shipping but honestly i ca n't tell if the gaping crowbar looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no	20
1	this is one of the prettiest shades fiestaware has put out i would like to see them put out a bright shade of pink as well	20
1	simple straight forward to use very easy to clean and durable ca n't beat it for the price better than any drip	20
1	i was impressed when i received this case for my fiance 's christmas present as i began cramming the body pillow into it i was happy to find a zipper at the opening all of the other body pillows i 've had inevitably fall out of the case thus offering little support during the night when you 're not awake to notice it 's very thick and seems durable i recommend it	20
1	eeks mice are great ! most catnip mice lose their flavor smell attraction for my cats pretty quickly but my cats still play with an eeks i 've had for over a year the one drawback is that they do n't look too good after being played with \( teeth marks drool stains ripped off tails etc \) but cats do n't care about that	20
1	my husband suggested this as a birthday gift for me i thought okay until i opened the package this shamrock green is so pretty this dinnerware is great a nice heavyweight the glazing is brillant and the cereal bowls are a good size not too small as other types tend to be i am very happy i own this and have bought more since	20

1	just purchased my airwasher humidifier and so far am pleased with the ease of maintenance i felt compelled to write a review and let other consumers know that the required water treatment additive is available from the manufacturer website with no shipping and handling charges www venta airwasher co	20
1	sango stoneware has been great for us for everyday use good feel with smooth surfaces including the bottom so it does n't scratch i 've built up a whole collection of sango gold dust after seeing it at bed bath and beyond pick up items on sale no need to pay regular price this set is a great addition to a more complete collection	20
1	i bought this to hold some of my overflow knives that would not fit into my knife block it has proven to be very handy it seems well made im not expecting miracles from a knife tray so that doesnt really say a lot but it is sturdy and nice looking it occupies about half of a drawer which leaves plenty of room for the rest of the non sharp cooking utincils to sit next to it i have now switched its intended purpose slightly insead of just holding the overflow from my counter top knife block this now holds my most commonly used knives the real knife block now sits farther away in the corner occupying the overflow from this one	20
1	i 've had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued wusthof global and henckels knives organized out of sight protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger 'made mostly for show' blocks would if you 're looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger that 's just my opinion i could be wrong	20
1	the krups xp 2070 has been in use at my household for about a month now with no problems to speak of we use the espresso machine with cappucino attachment almost daily and each time it has been very good a notice i would give to the espresso enthusiast looking to buy would be the need for a different tamper than the one provided the provided tamper is plastic and can be wobbly but i am very satisfied with the product	20
1	i 've had this for over a month and i 've only made grilled chicken with squash and asparagus if you do n't marinate your meat it will get really dry easy to clean most of the time	20
1	this whisk is very nice and feels very comfortable and sturdy in hand one thing i had n't foreseen however is actually pretty obvious the silicone does n't slide very well along most surfaces so trying to whisk along the bottom of a bowl or pan is a little difficult due to the friction it is exactly as advertised though and i am very happy to have it	20
1	i found this same item at a target store in stock for only 39 99 they also have it for sale on line for the same price it 's a great chair	20
1	my son is a star wars nut and just loves this blanket	20
1	so far so good i have a 3mo shep that so far has a blast with this thing i saw one reviewer that said it tore apart and will update as time goes by so far i love them well she loves them easy for her to pick up when the ball is much larger than her mouth \( holes in ball \) the football shaped one bounces in odd directions but highly recommend the blue one as dogs see blue well \( color blind \)	20
1	the plates are modern and good looking always rate compliments from guestts i would like them more if they were a little bigger	20
1	i'm certainly glad to have this pointer you 'd never know it is inexpensive since it looks quite sleek \( like a fountain pen though heavier for sure \) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance pleasantly sensitive to the touch it needs no fussing you 'd have to have pretty specialized needs to want a more expensive model	20
1	my six month old son would not eat anything off a spoon or out of a bottle finally i tried mixing baby cereal and putting it in this then i mixed cereal and babyfood and or mashed food he loves it ! no gagging either ! i'm here now buying the replacement bags	20
1	my boxers just love the little balls they like digging them out of the container even though it did not take very long after they got the hang of it they carry the balls and container all over the house and yard it has held up very well we have had this over a year now and i only had to stich up maybe 2 of the balls once each squeekers still work great have n't needed to replace yet very happy with this toy	20
1	this is absolutely hands down the best toy we 've gotten for our dogs we own three sets of these in varying sizes because the balls are plush they will wear out this is not for your destructive chewers our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day before leaving for work pop a couple of treats inside and you 're out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks	20
1	easy to use and store very stable and strong	20
1	this is one of my most used knives in the kitchen it 's the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons you 'll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily the blade keeps its edge for a long time but eventually you will have to sharpen it i invested in a good coarse stone a good 1000 grit water stone and the 5 clamps you slip over your blade to keep the sharpening angle constant good stones are expensive though i think it 's worth it for such a fine knife	20
1	the good \( function \) 1 \) rubber non slip base and good weighting2 \) clear plastic allows full view of soap level3 \) long spout allows easy access to sink no counter spills ! 4 \) smooth pumping action no clogs5 \) pump goes all the way to the bottom sucks it all out ! 6 \) wide opening makes it easy to transfer soap from a largebottle the bad \( aesthetics \) 1 \) not beautiful \( not horribly ugly either \) 2 \) no choice of color would have preferred white to matchkitchen appliances verdict function wins out over aesthetics highly recommended	20
1	this sharpner worked so well that i bought a second one to have when i wear this one out	20
1	this was one of the best buys for the kitchen i hate brown lettuce and this makes sure it does n't turn brown you ca n't beat the price either ! i recommend this to everyone !	20
1	you ca n't go wrong with this knife i use it almost as much as i use my 8 inch chef 's knife it holds an edge well feels light in your hand and has perfect ballance	20
1	this knife has made me eat more vegetables just because it 's so much fun to chop carrots i was a little concerned with the handle at first but it 's very comfortable and is n't slick at all even in soapy water i also worried that maybe i should have gotten the bigger version of this knife again my fears were unfounded as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation you ca n't really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job but if you 've ever had that feeling you already know how you 'll feel using a global when i slice carrots for snacks they come out as perfect translucent discs any vegetable i 've cut has been a joy	20
1	i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife oh wow this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it 's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies it also fits in your hand extremely well if you are going to cut up a potato it is hard to beat the chef 's knife however for cutting up a tomato carrot etc this thing is the best tool i have ever used just wonderful	20
1	not the best wine opener you can buy but a great deal for the occassional wine drinker much easier to operate than the traditional corkscrew and a bargain at the 9 99 i paid	20
1	loved this rug i have purchased 5 nicer than the one at crate barrel and at such an affordable price	20
1	the dishes not only look good but are a good size the complete set is really nice not too dark so that other colours can also be used at the same time	20
1	my husband travels to uk frequently and it 's hard to find a good cup of coffee there we 've looked everywhere for a portable coffee press that would work in a hotel room in conjunction with a hot water pot this fills the need completely	20
1	this mug is microwave and dishwasher safe a great mug for a large cup of cocoa or coffee makes a great christmas gift for a cat lover	20
1	i have not tried to program the timer yet but as a heater this is one of the nicest i have had compact yet it puts out a nice even heat it is save in that the unit itself does n't get red hot the ad says factory reconditioned yet it came in a new box and looks like new a super deal for auxiliary heating i use it to warm the livingroom to keep oil consumption down which it seems to have done so far without too big an increase in the electric bill	20
1	i was looking for a tiered cake stand to display cupcakes for a wedding shower and could n't find one that was priced right and had flat tiers \( there are many towers specific for cupcakes only \) i finally found this one and it worked out beautifully a guest from the wedding has asked where to get it for herself i highly recommend it	20
1	these are a purchase to go with wamsutta sheets my daughter likes extra pillows these wash very well and are nice and heavy duty pillow cases are usually expensive for 2 99 at the closeout price i got a bargain !	20
1	i just tried this out for the first time and i was impressed it baked evenly and nicely best of all the cake came right out i simply sprayed it lightly with non stick spray and baked due the flexibility of this product you do need to put it on a baking sheet for stability i will be buying more from this line	20
1	love it ! rechargeable seems to last better than battery operated ones the design has improved too i have had two of them i love how you can dismantle this one so it wo n't break if packed away makes good froth too	20
1	this could well be the perfect dog toy especially if your dog is a queensland heeler with a knack for destroying plastic frisbees tennis balls etc in seconds flat i 've had one for a couple of weeks now and aside from some dirt spots it looks new it is an unheard of feat for a toy to make it this long when exposed to the not so tender mercies of my dog 's attention this disc is not only very durable it actually flies really well as something of a flying disc connoisseur i ca n't help but be impressed by how easy this is to throw and how far it carries plus it floats perfect !	20
1	excellent item very powerful and stylish would recommend this mixer to anyone that likes to bake and has trouble with power from hand held mixers	20
1	i am really enjoying my sunbeam mixer it mixes good altho i'm not to crazy about the button to raise the mixer it is a little hard to push i would buy another one if i had to	20
1	these treats have been great for our large breed older dog who has developed arthritis in his hips they 're also one of the few glucosamine treats that do n't make him sick	20
1	perfect for anybody who appreciates no frills straight lined attractive furniture it 's modern and sturdy and a great match for my kitchen dinette set i love it ! and the price is right too	20
1	perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who do n't like their food all running together on your plate good for snacks like pudding and jello also good for anyone who wants salad dressing on the side nice and shallow for spooning out the dressing plus it wo n't take up alot of space on your table this is a very nice color	20
1	we are using this piece in our wedding as part of the unity candle ceremony we are using our own candles from another vendor part of our wedding theme is silver intertwined hearts which is why we picked this piece we like that it is contemporary and very different from the usual unity candle holder	20
1	i have had this unit for 8 months and have n't had any problems it has ground my coffee fine enough and not cracked i have not experienced a problem with it being too fat to hold with one hand and i have very small hands some of the coffee does stick to the inside but is easily removed with a spoon or napkin	20
1	this is a very useful shot glass as you can see use it for measuring cocktails or for drinking a shot of your favorite liquor it is a very sturdy glass i highly recommend	20
1	it is n't exaclty what i expected but it works it looks nice and holds a lot of coats and does n't tip over it serves its purpose are there better quality coat racks \? yes but for this price its worth it	20
1	i was looking for an quot offset serrated knife quot as mentioned by bourdain and this fits the bill outstanding veggie slicer and all around food prep instrument even over ripe tomatoes the kind with a still tough skin and insides soft as pudding are no match for it besides the small and handy size the handle design means that the blade meets the cutting board before your knuckles when it finally begins to dull several swipes on a good steel will bring the edge back to rights	20
1	the wonder washer appears cheaply made but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine it augments my regular washer nicely washing small loads and delicate items well on the debit side the washer 's design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly	20
1	the electrolux sweeper that uses these bags is very expensive and so are the bags if i had known that i could only purchase these online i may have chosen another vacuum system but on the bright side the sweeper works very well and the bags are not too challenging to put on and remove	20
1	it 's small enough to fit in my little kitchen it works as advertised the waffles were fast to make clean up is easy hardly any needed i made mine very light \( folded in whipped egg whites after the batter was all mixed up \) i can imagine making these heart shaped waffles for dessert	20

1	this unit is slightly difficult to wash since it has the cord attached but other than that it is easy to use there are not many settings or buttons to complicate matters	20
1	over the years i 've tried a good dozen humidifiers worries about bacteria difficulty in filling up and difficulty in operation led me to trash them all i now have two u7142 himidifiers the control system is extraordinary you can set desired humidity fan speed and time to run there is preheater \( to 40c \) that helps kill the bad stuff and use of silver \( do n't understand it but assume it works \) to kill more bad stuff liked the first so much i bought a second	20
1	i bought this stone to detail the edge of the new set of calphalon forged kitchen knives that i recently purchased i have used oriental water stones in the past and this stone is as good as any i have used with just a few strokes it will turn a calphalon henckles or wusthof into a gillette with this stone and a good steel your knives will last far beyond your years	20
1	i was glad to see the unit arrived without damage \( despite poor packaging supplied by the manufacturer \) the unit works great !	20
1	my roommate and i use this toaster daily and i 've never had problems with it the material is light but very sturdy i actually dropped it down my stairs when i moved and it still looks and works great i love all the features which are easy to use if you take about 30 seconds to read the instructions delonghi must have replaced the handles because the one on mine is metal i plan on buying another just like this after mine dies but i suspect that wo n't happen for quite a while	20
1	this is the best way to clean a grill i use one each time that i clean the grill this is a must buy it is a great idea	20
1	we received the zephyr as a wedding gift ours is a little newer design than what is shown in the photo the handle on ours is brass instead of chrome it heats fast and holds plenty of water for several cups of tea or cup o noodle much nicer than some of the higher priced tea kettles out there my wife and i are very pleased with this tea kettle	20
1	my husband and i have really enjoyed this product they are very soft and a good sized towel	20
1	we have had this unit for 6 months and we really enjoyed it it makes a great cup of coffee it is easy to use and we do not understand why some other reviews complain then without any warning it stopped working i called hamilton beach and they are sending a free replacement no questions asked the unit has a hassle free 3 year warranty and it really was a snap we are glad we bought this unit and are happy with how hamilton beach stands behind their products	20
1	the filter model i have 18150 requires two of these with no foam spacers two of these were less expesnive than the single larger filter i purchased once previously however i 'd say that two small ones are about a quarter inch too tall maybe slightly less the cover still goes on but not as far down as it should as for filtering i estimate that it filters the same as the previous the permanence of this filter makes me wonder why i 've been replacing the previous style since i can see no difference in the filter material	20
1	i was alittle skeptical buying these but they seem to be working great	20
1	still find it somewhat big for a dorm room \( but if you have a double and are sharing the fridge this much room is probably necessary \) but works great	20
1	i received my butter dish in a very timely fashion very well packaged too the product is wonderful it 's being used on a daily basis i am extremely happy with the product the shipper	20
1	i just started collecting fiesta ware and this yellow covered butter dish is the perfect color for a butter dish ! looks great on my table \( along with my red salt and papper shakers	20
1	i bought the fiestaware cobalt butter dish while living in arizona the butter sold there is packaged in shorter wider and higher sized sticks so it did n't fit into the butter dish unless i trimmed it ! ! could n't figure it out why would they make a butter dish that a stick of butter wo n't fit into \? \? ! ! so have just moved to the houston area and guess what the butter here is sized just right for the dish maybe they need to make two different sizes for west and east coast butter \? \? crazy ! nice butter dish though	20

1	impressive machine overall i 've had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch looking around on the internet this seems to be fairly common i understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine the attachments are great for hard floors and furniture i am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time i use the machine but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point even the refurbished one	20
1	my husband loves cereal for breakfast and i bought it so he does n't have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal it was a perfect fit for him and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses i was surprised at how big it was but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful the rubber turn knob does n't jam up as easily as i expected although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense only complaints 1 the top plastic covers are not completely airtight but are fine for dry cereal 2 the bottom rubber covers fall out easily they should fit more snugly	20
1	i ordered this four piece set and really like it the quality seems great and durable the color is defitely not white it is more of a light tan color but the price was too good compared to other sets i 've seen at pier 1 ect so i wo n't be retuning it just want you all to know it 's not white but very sturdy	20
1	this pan along with several others i have acquired from the calphalon tri ply line is fantastic great weight and balance superb craftsmanship the glass lids fit snugly and most important of all the pricing is terrific i have all clad and yes it is wonderful but quite frankly i find myself asking why spend more when you can get equal quality for quite a bit less and it is still made in u s a	20
1	just got it as a add on to an order and found that my cats really liked it all you have to do is open the bag and they come a runnin	20
1	very well made and far more attractive than a wire cage or plastic crate this pen is a great option for keeping a larger pet in the living room our dog a rescued border collie is incontinent so she cannot roam around the house and while she prefers being outdoors with this great looking pen she can now spend quality time inside in the same room as her family \( instead of out back in the mud room where her old wire cage was \)	20
1	we use it as supplemental heat in our apartment raises the temp of our entire 1000 sq ft apartement about 10 degrees with no problem \( our landlords have the thermostat \) however check the shipping price shipping nearly doubled the price on the item	20
1	i got this for our 3 year old daughter 's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night i would n't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room the top and back do get hot although you 'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned bumping into it should not cause any burns i have n't noticed any odors or noises from it	20
1	i recently upgraded to this machine i had an antique white that only sewed straight and zigzag imagine my pleasure at having a machine that can make 48 different stitches ! i'm very happy with the product you ca n't go wrong with a singer product	20
1	this worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines cute as a button ! it works the same as the large madeleine pans and is made from the same heavy weight metal but the result is darling would be great for tiny garnish on a larger dessert for a tea or just because some people prefer small doses of good things !	20
1	i have ordered two of these from this vendor both times the product was received almost a month after i ordered it the product is nice and of good construction but again if you need this in a hurry choose another place because they dont know how to mail it right out	20

1	i love these pieces i plan on using them as decorative items when not being used to entertai	20
1	these are great knives especially for the price they are just like the pro s line from henckels only are not hardened the same way they are sharp the chefs knife sliced a very ripe tomato straight out of the box they have excellent weight and balance and the handles are comfortable all in all a great buy ! i ca n't believe i used dull knives for some many years when these wonderful and affordable knives were so accessible definitely worth their weight in gold	20
1	plastic bowl seems like cheap plastic the motor is great as it puree and chops	20
1	this product is great it helped me organize my closet space and my shoes fit perfectly in the slots	20
1	this was a lot of fun its big and different from my golden 's other toys and it makes a really unusual sound not a squeak but a honk if you will the problem came when my golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker this is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog 's short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan	20
1	the price was excellent ordering was quick and easy delivery was prompt the high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen they performed flawlessly on my electric griddle	20
1	this toaster oven is perfect i have had this oven for about 6 months and had enjoyed cooking meals in the summer months without heating up the entire house i have even cooked a whole chicken in it this oven cooks food evenly and i have had no problems with it at all i highly recommend this product update i still have this toaster oven and use it almost everyday i still absolutely love it and do n't understand why everyone else seems to have issues with it i do n't know what i would do with out this oven i have owned it for over 3 years and it still works perfect i recently cooked a prime rib in it and it turned out fabulous	20

1	i own dozens of wine glasses from the most expensive lead crystal to winery logo glasses i also have a set of reidel vinum 's as well i bought these for everyday dishwasher use wow ! both the red and white are wonderful i side by side taste tested \( glass to glass \) my chardonnay \( yes mine \) and the white wine glass was way above average and perfect for everyday frankly white wine dose n't need a snifter glass as some do tip it also helps to not fill the glass to the top and please do n't freeze the chardonnay !	20
1	the product is everything as described plus it stores alot of laundry and wheels easy	20
1	not to be bought if you want to hatch alot of baby brine shrimp but great if you want to hatch an occasional snack for your fish or to have around if the power goes out nifty easy to use product	20
1	the best thing about this foil cutter is the magnetic back i had been looking for another one for 6 months ! we just love it	20
1	my wife loves rachael ray and was very excited to receive this cutting board set as a christmas gift	20
1	i 've gone through several fogless mirrors in the last 20 years and this one is simply the best i owned one before made by z fogless and could not find a replacement when it was broken i had tried many other brands and found them to cloud up soon after i got them the z fogless is the best shower mirror and the price beat all the competition including ebay	20
1	i love my mogu doll this is the third one that i have purchased i now have two and my sister in law who always wanted to steal mine now has her own	20
1	a few scratches on the wheels and here and there but looks new overall it works like new probably not a perfect vacuum but works well parts are available if you need them not a top of the line but neither is the price at 60 70 with free shipping	20
1	this knife block is a must for any miracle blade 3 owner it fits all the knives in the original set plus the four bonus all purpose knives included with the block holds 14 knives plus kitchen scissors in a neat compact counter saving block it 's a perfect	20
1	i like a big mug of coffee and the senseo coffee maker just does not have that much room under the spout my tall mugs do n't fit but these do perfectly just a note for fellow senseo lovers	20
1	we recently purchased this kit to install on the top and bottom stairs with a kidco gate it was very easy to install its very sturdy and we did not have to drill any holes into our banister we would definately recommend it to everyone	20
1	this product is very well constructed it is simple to use and easy to clean i use it to cook brown rice and dry beans and it has cut my cooking time down immeasurably i have only had it a few months so far and i have not been able to perfect the rice \( there always seems to be too much water left at the end \) but i will keep reducing the amount of water until i have the perfect mix i would highly recommend this pressure cooker to anyone beginning cooks or seasoned culinary experts i 'll certainly be sending one down to south carolina for mothers day	20
1	this bread tray is perfect plum ! ! the color is amazing and the tray is so useful for so many things ! ! get several of these !	20
1	the casserole was exactly what my daughter wanted it was priced right and came within a few days of odering i am very pleased with this purchase	20

1	i am starting this collection for my mother it is so adorable i love that it can be dressed up or down	20
1	both my fiance and i are very pleased with this warming mattress pad the dual settings work perfectly and the variety of heating intensities are excellent there is also extra emphasis on the feet a brilliant idea well worth the cost in my opinion	20
1	after reading some of the previous reviews about shipping damage i almost did n't order it however it arrived in great shape and the packing material was excellent someone must have gotten sanyo 's attention on the quality of their packing material	20
1	if you like fondue you 'll like raclette as much or even more use your imagination do n't stick with what is traditional you can use your raclette for desert pizza breakfast and much more ! traditionally served with steamed red potatoes this will satisfy the meat and potatoe man in the group marinade the meat with different flavors to add some spice do n't forget the vegetables slice onion red peppers mushrooms romas and even pineapple it 's a great way to spend an evening with a couple of friends extra trays are a good idea if you use your raclette a lot	20
1	the price went down from 6 95 to 3 95 it 's very nice looking you will be pleased with it approximately 13 and a half inch square i was expecting a black cloth loop to hang it from but the loop turned out to be the sewn in label that 's okay	20
1	i purchased the ic70 ice crusher for my father for christmas who eats ice all day long he loves it and pleased with its performance i used it myself a couple of times and like it as well i would recommend this product to anyone who wants crushed ice	20
1	i searched for a long time before i purchased this product and have not regretted my decision to buy like all ice crushers it is a little noisy	20
1	i looove this mug its such a beautiful shade of red very nice looking also these mugs are huge one of mine already has a chip on it but i 'll leave that to certain people in my house being very clumsy	20
1	bought these not too long ago i use them all of the time they do a great job on towels men 's under clothing permanent press clothing cleaning rags \( not microfiber never soften those \) etc i find the drying time is a little less the clothes do not tangle and they smell nice and clean best of all no chemicals if you have clothes with a lot of static cling then you can throw in maybe half a dryer sheet to reduce that problem i love these little guys recommend them to all and especially chemically sensitive folks	20
1	first one that i have purchased and it is extremely wonderful in the weight content as well as keeping us warm without feeling smothere	20
1	a little disappointing we have several cuisinart products including a food processor that we 've had for umpteen years and still works like new we also have 4 cuisinart pans or skillets with the same comment the toaster toasts but not a lot better than the cheapo toaster that we replaced we 've only used it a few times so maybe it will be better once we get used to it	20
1	works just fine for my needs i use it to press my 'wrinkle free' dockers the water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill but once it is filled it lasts a good long time heavy duty well constructed dependable unit first package 'disappeared' at ups when they shipped the first machine it was evidently damaged and returned back to amazon by ups \( probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing \) the replacement shipment arrived just fine and as always amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'	20
1	this vase is beautiful i'm considering purchasing the matching hostess pieces to complete the set	20
1	good fabric and nice size great for the price free	20
1	i read a few not so favorable reviews mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand \( which mine does not suffer \) but i decided to order it anyway figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand \( you can also wall mount it \) well it has paid off as the magnets work as promised the tines stay sealed tight and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own as for labels there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack and it has worked beautifully	20
1	i 've had my juicer now for about 3 years and i have n't had any problems with it in fact after having had several juicers this one is my favorite in the price range i also do n't understand the customer service problems one of the rubber feet on the bottom split and i called customer service a week later i had four new ones in the mail ! pros much quieter than most juicers of its type as well i did a side by side comparison with my buddie 's juiceman juicer and my yield was approximately 30 greater cons as with any other similar juicer cleaning it gets old that 's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times day	20
1	i really like this kitchen gadget as it different actually useful and my hands smell less like garlic thus far i have only used it to chop herbs onions and garlic so i ca n't debunk the mush mess i would simply say do n't pull the cord a lot if you 're worried about it i bought about 5 and gave them all out as x mas gifts	20
1	i have n't used this for herbs but i have used it for onions and garlic and like the other reviewers found it very handy for quick and tear free mincing it 's a very simple design and holds more food than you would expect i love that it 's only 3 small parts \( 4 if you count the rubber blade \) that all fit easily into the dishwasher \( top rack \)	20
1	i highly recommend the spiegelau authentis line for value and beauty these glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day while a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used \( and washed ! \) on a regular basis if you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience give these a try	20
1	best price i have ever seen for this product and free shipping to boot !	20
1	great product very soft save my expensive mattress from my son 's mishaps several time already however one of the stain got though perhaps it 's not 100 water proof	20
1	nice little toaster with good price just be careful it can get really hot when toasting	20
1	not fancy but it does the basic jobs well minor concern better at baking than toasting toasting takes a little too long and is not totally uniform but for the price this machine ca n't be beat	20
1	i love going to other peoples party 's and sharing a few drinks but never had a good way to carry to bottles of bubbly or other drink of choice before this product i purchased an orange one last year and like it so much i'm giving them as gifts this holiday season they fit almost any round or squire 750ml bottle \( absolute sky captain jose cuervo bushmills \) however oddly shaped bottles a bit of a tight fit like baileys	20
1	i received this as a christmas gift i 've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you 're flying it 's the best way i 've ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere	20
1	i have made 3 batches with it and everyone has come out perfect just add the mix water and a packet of brewers yeast and even a small packet of baking yeast will work its easy no mess and you dont need to add any sugar unlike its lower priced ugly cousin mr beer the only recomenation i have is when you pour half of it with water then add the mix stir it untill almost disolved then add more water make sure its alittle warmer then room tempature alot of it will disolve then add the yeast and wait about 5 days then put it in the fridge for 10 and it will be perfect	20
1	this is a nice product it gets the job done i have to disagree with the one reviewer the description plainly states that the board is made of polyethylene the midnight granite signifies the color for 9 99 14x17 is a great price	20
1	the franciscan apple dinnerware covered sugar bowl is a perfect match for the franciscan apple creamer you can keep granulated sugar or sugar cubes in this bowl mine is in constant use for the coffee and tea drinkers as well as for those who like a bit of sugar on their morning cereal or grapefruit half a must have for the franciscan apple collector	20
1	i really like having this it 's odor free and easy to use yes you have to empty the bags and that takes time but it 's worth it i have found refills at walmart petsmart and petco so they have n't been hard to find	20
1	they worked so well we decided to have a themed drink for our superbowl party this year it was in miami so we went for pink flamingos and palm trees we served cubano sandwiches and mojito cocktails the mojito 's were a hit we set up a mojito education station on our computer playing the bacardi mojito video then we had a station set up with mint sugar rum lime wedes ice and soda water this muddle was an excellent purchase it did the job efficiently and well even mojito novices got the hang of it easily great buy and good luc	20
1	i'm please with my coat rack i have several heavy jackets on it and it 's sturdy as well as attractive i would recommend it especially at the price	20
1	i purchased this coat rack as a replacement for one that was similar in color and style because it had broken i could n't be happier with the product i received and i am sure that it will last just as long as the other one that i had a great buy	20
1	this was very easy to put together and it holds a lot of coats great product at a great price	20
1	it is hard to find spoons for tall drinks these are excellent quality nice heft and good looking as well highly recommend	20
1	this little franciscan apple dinnerware creamer is so beautifully made there is a matching sugar bowl and lid too i do not use mine to hold cream or half and half on an everyday basis because i would have to keep it covered with saran wrap so the liquid would not absorb any refrigerator odors however i do love to use it when i use my franciscan apple coffepot or when entertaining at a dinner party there is also a small milk jug and there are two other larger pitchers in the apple pattern i have also used the apple creamer as a server for sauces	20
1	i am very pleased with this product the atelier wash is soft absorbent and looks good after laundry i have always found the martex brand to be top quality	20
1	i purchased these to use with my steamfast mop they are machine washable and fit fine even after being thrown in the dryer perhaps the steamfast head is slightly smaller than the bissell i do n't know about that but they fit well on it they are sturdy and well made	20
1	this steam mop was the best idea bissell came up with i have three small kids and the steam mop cleans up all the mess in no time at all it 's so easy to use even the kids like to mop the floors the only complaint i have is that the pads are hard to get on i have broke a few nails doing this it would be nice if they came up with an easier way to do this	20
1	there was no dimensions on the description so i took a chance it was a bit smaller than i thought \( about 2 5 cubic \) but that happens to work out perfectly for my purposes it is lovely and the color really adds to the kitchen my guests all loved it	20
1	overall this is a very nice item i have been using it to make mojitos and it works wonderfully the only negative thing i have to say about it is the handle could be longer	20
1	very good rice cooker the steam function is very useful for such a lazy student like me i can cook the rice and steam my food at the same time i used it for almost a month but still working functionally highly recommended if you dun wanna pay too much for a useful rice cooker	20
1	these are nice to keep a martini cold but they 're a bit large	20
1	a beautiful pan from kitchenaid i use it for everything and the lid is a big bonus think of it as a 10 skillet you use everyday which can also go into the oven and also be used for serving quality and heft is better than all clad	20
1	there is n't a lot to say about this other than this pan demonstrates the kitchenaid high quality that one would expect from kitchenaid it 's extremely well made and of very high quality	20
1	i am very pleased with this mixer it is just as i requested received in excellent condition the performance reaches all of my expectations in a kitchenaid appliance	20
1	these are great and match the duvet cover wonderfully i am very pleased with my purchase !	20
1	this coat rack is simple and sturdy it has several pegs for longer coats at the top and below are ones just the right height for my daughter to reach it can handle many coats and other items you toss on it without falling over color is nice although we usually see little of it	20
1	the coat rack works wonderful for us we hang our robes \( tend to be thick and heavy \) before going into the hot tub it was very easy to assemble lightweight yet it holds the robesas one expects a coat rack to do i do n't understand the reviews that indicated difficulty assembling or trouble with its stability none of that is the case for us	20
1	we are very pleased with the quality of this couch the leather is soft but durable the craftsmanship is excellent and it is very attractive also the delivery was exceptionally fast we highly recommend this product	20
1	we have been looking for a reasonable priced armoire for a while this piece is very sturdy and adds so much elegance to our living room the instructions for assembly were easy to follow however it did take my husband and i about 4 hours to put it together it is well worth the time and money we put into it i love it ! ! !	20
1	i bought this vacuum to use in the bathroom which i share with my cat 's kitty litter box it sits in the corner and after i clean her box i just sweep the spilled litter over to the vac and voom all gone	20
1	i bought this because it was on sale and i wanted to try it now i want to kick myself for not getting it sooner this is a gaget worth having my husband even loves it it makes sweeping up after 5 kids and a dog a breeze it gets plenty of use and it still going strong it is very user friendly and so easy to empty	20
1	this is my second panasonic and i love it it is simple to use and does a great job	20
1	this set is so versatile i bought these because i own the red le creuset cookware and they matched them i thought that i would never use them and they would collect dust in the cupboard but the longer i own them the more uses i find for them ! great for appetizer containers for making mini casseroles \( or quiches \) creme brulee serving soup i 've even baked mini bread loaves in them ! the only recommendation i have is to buy two sets i usually end up using four at a time instead of two	20
1	fiestaware rocks ! the turquoise place setting is beautiful it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon com fiestaware is functional calssic and fun i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware i mix up colors that you would n't normally expect to go together and they usually look great	20
1	i had all but given up hope on electric can openers until i bought this one you can tell when you pick it up that it 's of good quality \( not cheap plastic junk \) the removeable head is also very solid heavy duty and washes easily in the dishwasher the black and chrome design looks very stylish on my kitchen counter as well i'm a believer again in electric can openers	20
1	i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon it 's a beautiful print and a good color that matches my drapes but what i did n't quite understand at the time i bought it was that it 's also just one big piece of fabric no fitted edges or elastic to hold it in place kind of disappointing but since i was covering a futon i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds shove a wooden dowel into the crease and voila ! a great looking couch appeared so all things considered a pretty good buy for the money	20
1	i own reidel as well as spieglau the differences are slight the spieglau have a very nice tulip shape and the heft feel to them is very good and given the price if i break one i do n't get upset as i would with a reidel no wonder reidel bought the company i recommend the spieglau to anyone looking for an attractive well made glass at a moderate price anything that helps you enjoy the champagne a little more as these do deserve to be recommended	20
1	this is a great product very quick to heat and i enjoy the dettachable base feature the cons include a limited amount to pour water into the unit \( the lid does n't pop up very far \) and some of the finish does n't do great with steam overall a good buy	20
1	i like it very much kettle is in a good working condition and it looks good in a kitchen with all stainless steel appliances i would recomend to purchase this kettle as a good quality item	20
1	i love this honey pot the design is dainty but the pot itself is really good sized a beautiful accompaniment to the matching tea set	20
1	i received this set packed very well no scratches no broken pieces so i have no complaints the color is beautiful and the dishes are durable	20
1	this is a countertop friendly cordless espresso maker that makes great coffee when you use an espresso grind for the coffee the auto shut off makes it foolproof and it is made of stainless steel so no off tastes i think it is great	20
1	love the soup bowls they live up to the usual fiestaware quality as all of the other products from fiestaware so pick your color and enjoy	20
1	i recommend this product it is excellent quality very quiet when running and has lots of power	20
1	i love this little coffee maker i have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but i have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum this maker is made from stainless steel which is more expensive but for me it 's worth it \( as it will probably last a lifetime \) it makes a very good cup of coffee and i'm very happy with it also the customer service at the company that ships it out is excellent	20
1	started using these for a puppy since i work irregular shifts purchased a pad holder to stop her from shredding it works great no leaky messes and very little smell	20
1	it 's true you have to put the whole silly thing together yourself but that is why it is the price it is once put together it is lightweight and easy to move to where you want it i recommend putting it together on a hard surface we used a piece of plywood when you try to put it together on carpet the mallet does n't enough force to make it work right	20
1	for the price these bath sheets are great ! very soft and plush exactly what i was expecting	20
1	it is thicker than other bed pads but not as thick as i expected quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on easy to put on the bed	20
1	this is pretty in a rough casual sketched style this will require ironing out of the dryer	20
1	i bought one like this several years ago my pantry has a deep cabinet and only two shelves so buying several more has really improved the way my canned goods and other items are stored in it now can easily see what i 've got	20
1	this is the best book light ever my only issue is the battery life but i fall asleep and leave it on all night sometimes the pages are illuminated very well and it 's easy to use makes a great book mark too do n't let what i said about the batteries influence you not to buy i have both sizes i'm rough on them and i 've had no problems	20
1	these are simply beautiful glasses they are every bit as elegant as reidel but cost much less the glass is thin the shape is elegant they hold up well in washing i recommend them	20
1	i have been purchasing water at my supermarket and was spending more than 30 a month ! after we purchased this water filter i can tell there 's little difference between the water i buy at the store and the water from this filter i also feel confident if my daughters drink it because i know they 're not getting all of the bacteria and other hurtful chemicals and minerals present in tab water ! i recommend this filter	20
1	i have a beagle basset hound mix who as you can guess used to bark all the time after only using product for a coupld of says there is a vast improvement he does not even have to wear it all the time now there is a lot more peace and quite at my house since i purchased this product it saved my sanity	20
1	i really like these glasses the glass really does make a difference sometimes i 'll probably next purchase their red glasses	20
1	i am a sous chef and i use this knife to break down everything from shell steak to veal chops and i love it i also like the flexibility of the blade it holds an edge very well with minimum touch ups overall i am very happy with the wusthof line edit 4 6 05 still using it still like new almost 3 years of almost daily use later ca n't beat wusthof	20
1	this is wonderful the best laundry basket ever used	20
1	i got this gift from my husband i love the machine it so easy to use i read so many other and i was afraid i was not going to get the machine and go buy my normal coffee but i bought the coffe syrups and much more just to make them like the coffee shop was easy the only thing i do n't like is the height of th cup area or the noise i had to go purchase other cups and them dump it into my bigger cups they do offer you to buy a attachment for the bigger cups	20
1	this is wonderful i have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me i actually enjoy working with this the only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer but using really good litter and not too much of it stops that i told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this	20
1	the pillow was in the manuracturer 's box in brand new packing and condition and was delivered right on schedule	20
1	this was my third foil cutter in one month the other two were flimsy but cost about the same they each broke in about two weeks i have had this one for five months and it is n't broken yet	20
1	i bought this set for three times for serving 12 people ! i also bought a lot of the additional to the set for my whole kitchen great investment ! i love the feel of these dishes very nice smooth feel but all the bowls look slightly different the slight inconsistancys make you feel like you have a set of hand made set !	20
1	now i do n't know whether you are a die hard hello kitty fan or not but you gotta have this ! the numerous different settings the awesome design and the fact that it 's hello kitty makes it worth it 's weight in gold i had been looking for one of these cheap and i ended up getting one for the holidays ! so that worked well these toasters are cheap as they come online here so grab em and go ! good luck if ya get one ! \( the hello kitty waffle maker and juicer rock too !	20
1	the riedel syrah shiraz wine glasses are a nice combination of fine glassware yet also have a sturdy feel	20
1	i bought this exact same slicer 20 years ago for my mom and it has lasted it 's a unique item that guests love and it 's easy to clean up as well	20
1	this machine replaces a semiautomatic delonghi which i thought was decent well after using this for 3 weeks i can honestly say that my old machine was barely competent the titanium is a wonderful machine not only is the espresso excellent but the panerella wand makes awesome froth and the thing looks great it 's fully programable and once set it 's just a matter of pushing a button to brew a delicious espresso every time ! it warms up in under a minute has a large bean hopper large water resevior very cool blue lcd display i ca n't rave enough i 've had no problems at all with this machine and i recommend it heartily	20
1	purchased at petsmart seems to work well very quiet when operating properly took our cats a little over a week to get used to it the flow is n't very good when the setting is low we keep it at medium i clean it out about once a week cat hair from our medium haired cat builds up and can clog the motor and scum forms on the sides of the drinking well	20
1	we love these glasses we have had the reidel glasses like these many times they break so easily and ca n't go in the dishwasher these glasses are so much more utilitarian we use them as our everyday glasses not just for wine they look great feel good in the hand and can go in the dishwasher and cost so much less we still keep the reidel on hand for special occasions they are more refined but i got so tired of that ultra thin glass breaking in my hand as i attempted to scrub the wine stains out of that porous glass i strongly recommend the libbey glasses you will like it like like it on your table table table	20
1	i bought these molds for my crystal light drinks so that i could have a more nutritious dessert option the molds are quite long so you get a very nice sized popsicle for your money the plastic is a bit on the thin side so the popsicles were a bit hard to get out as they were hard and the plastic is pliable make sure to really mix your liquid as it can settle in the very bottom impossible to get back out and the taste will go with it i have fun using these and they were reasonably priced	20
1	heats well and quiet does not blow heat very forcefully but certainly warms sufficiently given enough time using the oscillation function appears solidly built with good warranty	20
1	this is the fourth piece of furntiure i have bought from this line \( mission natural \) i love it i have a bookcase and two tables that originally were for a computer work center but use them as night stands it fits my 1950 's contemporary home perfectly price is great delivery even better i ordered on a saturday night and received it by tuesday noon i could n't ask for more	20
1	it 's as absorbent as advertised and the color is much better than the photos	20
1	light and non cotton these are like spounges and they work far better than any dish towel i 've used previously i have n't washed these but if there 's a problem i 'll update	20
1	this is a beautiful bookmark for anyone ! shipping was fast and packaging was excellen	20
1	i love the different speeds it offers i have found it to be really cleaning the dust from the room so far so goo	20
0	hard to set up and use no directions and ca n't find anything on the web would not buy if i knew this	21
0	80 for this \? seriously overpriced if you can find something cheaper buy it this is not worth 80 bucks clamps were not capable of holding a small boneless ham without slipping worked well with ribs	21
0	i was looking forward to purchasing this item until i got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost the cheapest shipping would run me 14 99 for an item costing 21 89 sorry weatherbuffs you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price	21
0	the third time i used this brush it broke the wood split diagonally at the neck of the brush a little before where the bristles start i now have the perfect implement with which to stake a vampire my other weber brush \( which i purchased at a diff website \) is still intact and works okay you see the bristles are a little gunked up that 's why i bought this second grill brush buyers and vampires beware	21
0	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
0	i was very disapointed with the smoker cover it is made of a very thin plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material this type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat weather and also some general scratching just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it the company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable sincerely yours allen vest iii	21
0	do n't waste your money \( even just 10 bucks \) the plastic is not rip stop and tears very easily i will now just use a big heavy duty black trash can liner they are much stronger	21
0	did not expect much for 10 bucks but give me a break 2 weeks and the plastic streched and tore around the handle up on top of the smoker i think a heavy duty trash bag is what this product is equivalent to	21
0	i normally bbq 8 9 racks of ribs at once for our annual party thought that this weber rib rack would make it easier however i found that it was more of a hinderance than a help i like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce several times so i have to remove them from the rack for basting getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain if you 're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook then it might be useful but that 's not me so i gave my weber rib rack to my brother in law	21

0	i only had product for 10 days and it stopped working correctly i opened up the unit to discover a circuit board had been hod poged on to the main board and it soldered connections had broken i would not advise the purchase of this item it is poory put to gether on the insid	21
0	i purchase my unit a little less than one year ago and now i am shopping for a different brand it worked fine for the first summer season in texas but now that it is spring almost summer it does not turn on at all i have completed all of the manual 's troubleshooting in addition to purchasing a new bulb and cable for it but it does not work anymore after only 1 summer usage ! i do not recommend ! !	21
0	i picked up this unit hoping that it would do the job in my backyard all that it has picked up is a few flying insects nothing else unless i am missing something do not waste your money	21
0	after twice sending the unit back to the factory the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on i tried all the suggestions made by the factory the following year i opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong i found totally frozen fan bearings i suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings to end my agonies with the unit i took it to the garbage dump the unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable when it worked it worked well i believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito	21
0	essentially a one season lightweight hibachi that does n't stand up to extended use so at 12 it 's too expensive but may be worth about 5	21
0	a handle was missing the box was retaped may be a return from a store etc overall the item is chintzy you have to assemble it the charcoal pan is painted black this will burn off slowly i am going to assemble it but this item when shipping is included is a total ripoff john	21
0	i have to agree with the bad reviews i used this smoker 6 times and the element burned out of course a replacement was 40 00 i purchased it new on sale for 65 00 it is now a charcoal smoker unless you have money to burn ! i would not recomend this item	21
0	i have had this smoker since august and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it i noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless the other problem i have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed dealing with charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless at the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered i would pass for something better	21
0	i loved this smoker the first two times i used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it did n't work at all after examining all the parts i noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points it was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but i was forced to pay the shipping ! i used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use i think i 'll go back to my charcoal grill	21
0	this is a beautiful piece of b b q sculpture and gets one star for looks alone but it bends too easily at the 'neck' and i'm already looking for a replacement after using it only 2 times ! looking back at the original information it stated that there is a lifetime guarantee against defects i wonder if a snapped off head would be considered a defect i will let you know what happens too bad about the brush it looked so good with my stainless steel weber	21
0	unfortunately when i opened the shipping box the lid of the grill was dented so i refused the shipment and sent it back	21
0	i ordered this piece and the matching chairs i have waited since july for them to be available they became availabe in september so i ordered them they kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs said they could n't get them so i had to cancel the sofa as well now i am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue ! !	21
0	do n't let the size of the box fool you even though this item comes packaged in a good sized box this product is barely one inch by two inches it 's just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it although it does seem to attract flies for a few days it does n't seem to last for very long at all it 's just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic ! in my opinion it 's just not worth it	21
0	beware amazon lists this cover with the weber performer grill it does not fit the 2006 performer and should not be purchased together	21
0	the cover that i received was much shorter than pictured someone else had the same problem i sent it back it seemed pointless i am using my old weber cover it does n't look real pretty but it provides outdoor protection which is the point	21
0	the advertisement picture shows the cover below the top of the wheels the cover i received was a full 3 inches above the top of the wheels and left the bottom storage rack fully exposed to the weather	21
0	this platter is only large enough to hold a very small steak or a sandwich it also very thin and light \( read flimsy \) i do not recommend it	21
0	after opening the weather station and setting it up i noticed that the numerical display was not readable with missing characters i contacted amazon and returned it within 5 days the replacement arrived with the same problem when i contacted them again they would not replace it again saying that the batch they have must be defective i was not aware that amazon was selling the seconds from other retailers a phone call to lacrosse remedied the situation they advised me to send in the defective unit and they will replace repair it and make sure it is perfect before leaving their premises they further advised the fail ratio with the problem i had with both units is less than 1 beware if buying this from amazon	21
0	i bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month one night i saw a mouse running across my stove so i brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop later that evening i was washing dishes and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of shake'n'bake right past the rodent repellant five times ! !	21
0	spiders are still hanging out in my garage happily and i do n't have a big garage either	21
0	i bought this item to deter flies because it says it will work with flying insects flies will actually land and sit on it without any apparent problems i gave it to charity	21
0	the repeller works fine at repelling but when on the rodent setting it makes an audible chirping noise that 's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people do n't normally go the reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed but the manual says that it 'll only run two or three days on battery power making it absolutely worthless for this use	21
0	i can utterly guarantee that this thing wo n't work i was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years we used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time \( it 's usually nice toasty warm in there \) sanitation exclusion and very careful application of pesticides is what you need rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time but quickly adapt \( adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best \) again count on sanitation exclusion and traps try to avoid baits because you 'd rather know where the little s o b died \( i e in a trap rather than in a wall somewhere \)	21
0	when i first got this home it seemed to do the trick ok the mice really avoided it however we could still hear them across the room i was going to order a couple more to place around the room but they walk right past it now ! it does n't seem to affect them at all ! for 20 it 's not a bad deal because obviously it works for some people it just did n't work for us	21
0	misunderstood directions made mistake of putting all sides together instead of a level at a time cracked all sides trying to take apart called 800 and asked what they could do for me and they said buy another one they 're not responsible also found out the box had two right side upper levels and it will take 7 days till the left side is sent suncast will never get my business again and i hope my warning will discourage others from doing business with this company	21
0	i bought one of these summer 2005 this unit runs way too hot to use as a smoker \( easily 250 300 degrees f \) i even got a replacement regulator from the mfctr but both ran too hot i 've had some success controlling temperature with valve on lp tank and a c clamp on the gas hose but only limited luck i 've tried using an electric hot plate burner but that only worked in warm weather and barely got above 200 degrees hate to say it but would recommend you invest your money elsewhere	21
0	i was disappointed with these tongs which was surprising since oxo makes good kitchen utensils i agree with other reviewers it is difficult to grasp and close them unless you have a rather large hand \( which i do n't \) you 're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel ! when comparing these to my 12 tongs my hand grasp was at the same point which really made these 16 tongs no different from the 12 ones	21
0	the tongs where hard to grip so what i did to avoid sending them back i took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward like a claw now they are excellent grip great love the long handle and heavy duty soft rubber hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back	21
0	aside from the nifty weather prediction this clock is completely impractical the projection numbers are about 1 2 inch tall with minimal clarity the clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible i am surprise this is sold on amazon thank goodness for amazon 's customer friendly returning policy i think amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good	21
0	waste of money the manual does n't have proper instructions and settings buttons also not working as per the manual i do n't know its fault with the manual or button settings i struggled for a week and returned this item	21
0	very nice alarm clock easy to set up but huge draw back is that the time screen is not backlit so if you want to see the screen you have to push a button very inconvenient ! ! ! !	21
0	this product is a waste of money the mice in my room are completely unaffected and walk right by the device without any sign of concern besides being ineffective the devices themselves make a slight buzzing sound \( not silent as advertised \) i now have to buy a set of \( humane \) mousetraps and i recommend that anyone reading this do the same and save themselves 40	21
0	had to send \( 2 \) smokers back due to damage during shipping was not shippers fault very bad packaging would be suprized if anyone could get one in good shape	21
0	item was not new and arrived with dents scratches gouges and jammed doors returne	21
0	i ordered the great outdoors deluxe gas smoker in anticipation of a summer of barbecue unfortunately the unit arrived structurally damaged based on the state of the box i would say it occured prior to ups picking it up but have no way of knowing sadly the replacement unit was also damaged there were huge dents that broke the welded seal i gave up have requested a refund from amazon and will seek a different brand of smoker i would definitely advise not to buy this product	21
0	in theory this is a nice set and i like all of the different tools but i bought this as a gift and i'm going to return it it just looks too cheap the wooden handles are chipped in some places there 's almost no finish on them and the plastic case is really flimsy and cheap looking perhaps if i was buying them for myself i would n't mind but i 'd be embarrassed to give this as a gift	21
0	the editorial review states its big enough for two heads to rest on it it would be more informative if you stated the dimensions of the pillow !	21
0	a nice try but just not that useful i keep finding it falling out and u think it ended up on the couch now	21
0	it does not appear to get rid of pests ! it 's nothing more than an expensive nightlight	21
0	i purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable when you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive if any water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys i am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai	21
0	a major concept of an atomic clock to me meant i would not have to reset it for dst other clocks in my home took care of it i waited two weeks and this clock did not i ca n't trust if for the true time so i am sorry i purchased it	21
0	the price for the item is reasonable the quality of the item is excellent the shipping costs are n't displayed on the selling page the shipping costs are more than the cost of the item do not buy with one clic	21
0	this item is such a huge hunk of junk ! first off the instructions are totally impossible to figure out and second off the outside temp is always off by at least 12 degrees	21
0	as the title says the remote sensor died a quick death so i got a replacement unit the remote sensor died on that one pretty quickly as well i know that sometimes things go wrong with good products but two sensors dying so quickly apparently was not a fluke this is a cheaply made piece of equipment so i guess you get what you pay for i gave a friend an oregon scientific unit three years ago and it is still going strong so i 'd advise you to stay away from la crosse and go with oregon scientific	21
0	this unit will be lucky to be within 15 deg of actual out side temp after several weeks of conversing the company sent me a different sending unit which turned out to be no more accurate than the original unit i would not recommend this unit to anyone	21
0	the outdoor sensor is not waterproof outdoor sensor died after 3 months do n't waste your mone	21
0	i am surprised that amazon permits the sale of this equipment many scientific evaluations have shown that the sound generators have no effects what so ever against rodents or for that matter against mosquitoes	21
0	i placed this thing in my small bedroom and it 's not even 200 sq ft and guess what i always see roaches coming out from my ac duct and even clawing over my bed and many times too it freaks me out ! i do n't believe any of this thing anymore ! roaches are so hard to get rid of ! i hate it	21
0	even after thorough cleaning leaves a terrible metal taste to the food i must 've washed this 5 or 6 times in my attempt to remove the metal odor i also noticed some rust colored powder on parts of the surface after washing yuck	21
0	the clock is great my son has one from discovery store and loves it and it does a lot of things well i bought one for my nephew through this amazon link and they never sent it my inquiry generated an email that everyone in their company was fired for doing a bad job and we would get a credit ! ! discovery 's price is higher but it is still a good deal for 30 and at least you actually get the clock	21
0	it arrived fast enough but i should have sent the chair back it 's pretty cheaply made the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape it 's ok but i 'll keep my eyes open for a better one and we wo n't swing on it i do n't think it would take it	21
0	order was shipped very quickly i will keep item advertised hanging hardware and swivel not included chair could easily fray cotten ends are only taped not knotted no way chair could be converted to 7 foot hammock as advertised i should have read advertisement closer i could have gotten 100 cotten chair for less this ad did n't state the material used i could buy from this company again i 'll just pay closer attention	21
0	we got this for our deck last may and it started to rust almost immediately i took it down in august to store for the winter tried to assemble it today \( mid april \) and two parts fell apart in my hands save your money	21
0	all it takes is one good windy day and say goodbye to your gazebo i lost two of these within a 3 year period	21
0	i ordered this last fall for a 40th party it looks nice but after a windy day a piece of the top broke off and after that it all fell apart because it didnt have any support from the broke top rail	21
0	looks nice when it was standing took several hours to erect doing it by myself had 20 mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and i had to throw it all out wrote to the company because it was only 2 weeks after i received it and heard nothing back so if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy but if not say goodbye	21
0	mine showed up broken it seems that a single string on a pulley is what is used to raise and lower the umbrella via the crank the string in mine was broken off \( not connected \) and inside the main pole not a great design for lasting a long time in any kind of weather i 'll try another brand	21
0	i purchased this for my husband and it quit working after 3 months	21
0	i'm very unhappy with these lights i placed them along the planter in my patio a couple feet away from the fence in full sun but they did n't work at all we set them out in the middle of the patio and now five of them do work for a little while but they do n't accomplish their purpose in that area they 're also in the way one of them has never worked at all i gave them the old college try for a month or so but now it 's too late to return them so i'm stuck with them and out my money	21
0	the lights are very faint and glow for about two hours after sunset half of the lights are on for less than an hour i am returning my lamps	21
0	after buying two automatic retractable hozelock 50 foot hoses \( that we love \) i bought this for the extra hose length it is a very disappointing unit it tends to bounce around when you are pulling out the hose and can be a pain reeling it back up i am a big guy and still struggle with it pull the nozzle back to the unit as instructed and then sit on it as you crank regarding the comments about it only taking the original nozzle i cut off the end and put on a std us hose fitting	21
0	when my house painter could n't figure out how to use the nozzle he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts i looked everywhere on line for a replacement part but could not find anything finally i called hozelock in new york and they sent me a replacement part they charged me about 6 for shipping a part that cost about 3 the system ca n't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler also it is hard to reel the hose in overall i do n't think this item is worth the cost if you need to call hozelock their number is 1 800 297 7461	21
0	clock does all that is claimed except it will not accept anything farther west than pacific time so if you are anywhere but in the lower 48 time zones you are sol	21
0	bought the driveway patrol and had nothing but problems with it it constantly went off no matter how many times i moved it around also when a car drove into the driveway sometimes it would n't go off ! ! ! talked to the telebrands people and after having to pay shipping to send the first one back they replaced it free however it worked just as bad as the first one now they refuse to refund my money ! ! this product is an absolute ripoff and i would n't recommend it to my worst enemy i agree with the other review that they would give it a minus 10 stars ! ! i suggest you beware of any other products you might want from telebrands	21
0	my driveway patrol worked okay for a few days then stopped sensing cars as they drove past does anyone know what i can do to get it working again	21
0	worked ok for about a day and a half then it would go off every few minutes for no reason changed batteries several times to no avail changed position in case squirrels or cats triggered it moved it from place to place even watched the scene and still sounded the alarm for no reason this is a piece of junk that will drive your dog crazy ! ! ! avoid ! !	21
0	the product is virtually worthless after making all possible adjustments the devise is totally unreliable i would really like to get my money back because the thing is already in the garbage	21
0	outdoor remote temperature sensor is not weatherproof instructions state the remote temperature sensor should be placed in a dry shaded area the battery cover has slits in it that will allow water to enter the unit hard to see how they call it an outdoor remote	21
0	its made nice but the frame is kind of wobbly and its kinda in the way when takeing the lid off and o	21
0	do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill ! there were warnings with this product saying that it should n't be left outside but i figured it could n't be that bad a couple months later i discovered that my cutting board \( left on a covered porch through a mild california winter \) had completely split into several pieces for a 30 outdoor product this is really unacceptable a plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better	21
0	the work table is plain wood not sealed there is a warning on the bottom not to let it stay wet since a charcoal grill must be used outside i do n't think the price justifies the limitations	21
0	color shown as natural is far from accurate i am unhappy with color and may return these	21
0	the chair has good back support and fits a 6 ft tall man well with even a little extra wood to support the head my stool arrived with the wood split so check it before the driver takes off if you can mind the instructions when you are putting it together if you do n't watch the bolts and the small blurry print on the step by step notes you can get turned around also the wood is almost orange in it 's color	21
0	would not buy this product even on sunny days the lights will only last a few hours in the evening and are not very bright i bought portfolio brand lights which are much better	21
0	these lights do n't hold a charge i called the manufacturer and they said that these are summer spring lights that require 12 hours of direct sunlight to work the ad on amazon did not say that i even charged the batteries using a wall charger and they still barely held a charge \( 1 2 hours \) they are also very dim lights do n't waste your money	21
0	very disappointed with this item only two of the eight lights work and they only stay on for about an hour there 's plenty of sunshine here in new mexico to charge them up but they still do n't work and are just plain worthless	21
0	it does not like rapid changes in temperature when the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back all of that is moot because now after only 2 weeks of operation it only works indoors though it is a mere 45 degrees outside sent it back	21
0	i like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature ok so i have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more many mornings i check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read for example 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees it will be 60 degrees inside my window is double paned but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings when not window mounted and placed by other thermometers the readings are acceptable and consistent	21
0	it worked for barely 24 hours on the second day many of the segments that make up the numbers disappeared making it useless	21
0	this basket is not stainless steel as advertised it is merely chrome plated i returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault' amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers i believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault this is not the level of customer service i have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with amazon	21
0	i also ordered this based on the description of stainless steel and was disappointed to receive a chrome plated product worse yet it does n't even fit the char broil universal rotisserie attachment i have for my grill	21
0	has vents to let in rain how dumb is that	21
0	the installation instructions require you to tighten the fitting to the point that you break the little black intstallation tool once the tank is empty it can not be refilled unless the station has an adapter i have not found a station with one yet you can not get the adapter off the tank with out the tool you broke they dont sell the black tool and it 's designed so nothing else fits you have to purchase the whole fitting just to get the tool another 17 00 down the drain after my third one i finally fabbed a tool out of a bolt head by grinding the head into the right shaped triangle	21
0	this grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear able the drawstring at it 's base is very easily prone to breaking i have bought and had to return this product twice already save yourself the trouble and look up market for something that you can depend on for a little longer than a single use	21
0	i'm tired of waiting for this item i may like it if it ever ships	21
0	the bbq mitt had lots of mold on it and had an awful smell the box paper and all smelled bad amazon was quick to accept a return with no return shipping charges amazon is great as usual but they need to drop this product	21
0	when i received this it was covered in mold and when they sent the replacement it was the same needless to say i returned both !	21
0	had for not even a month and when used it broke would not recommend	21
0	there oughta be a law i can utterly guarantee that this thing wo n't work i was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years we used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time \( it 's usually nice toasty warm in there \) sanitation exclusion and very careful application of pesticides is what you need rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time but quickly adapt \( adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best \) again count on sanitation exclusion and traps try to avoid baits because you 'd rather know where the little s o b died \( i e in a trap rather than in a wall somewhere \)	21
0	look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while i say it 's flimsy because it 's so skinny other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you 're stabbing into cuts of meat this smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more i say just get the larger one that 's more stable and takes less effort	21
0	i bought this grill basket for my husband for father 's day according to the description it had everything we were looking for detachable handle separate sections for separate cooking grilled veggies wo n't fall through etc unfortunately the basket is so poorly made that the baskets do n't open \( without a crowbar ! \) and the handle neither attaches or detatches without a whole lot of muscle my husband had to get out his tools and try to rebend the whole thing to get it to function what an over priced dissappointment	21
0	the spit is a very thick steel bar that is difficult to bend the forks and clamps to hold the food are solid with thick chrome the motor is made in taiwan and my first one came in dead on arrival read up on the other weber rotisseries reviewed by other customers and you will see the motor is a weak point	21
0	unfortunately installation instructions are not very clear for this item which results in complete harm into the grill be careful	21
0	i spent the extra on this alarm because i wanted a projection feature the projection feature lasted 2 weeks i also had a wall clock made by lacrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity save your money folks hopefully amazon will refund my	21
0	honestly the projection is n't bright enough to see unless you 're in complete darkness i would n't recommend this to anyone	21
0	the clock works well but is really too small and the projection only works well in dimly lit locations it also has to be at some optimal distance from the wall to actually see the numbers it does not have a focus feature if you wanted to put it close to a wall	21
0	i regret this purchase this clock has a very very low projection beam that barely makes it to my ceiling from my bedside table it 's definitely not readable if you have diminished eyesight and are n't wearing glasses as is the case with better models even more troubling the atomic clock part seems to set itself to random times in the middle of the night on the positive side the temperature reads accurate and it 's nice to have both inside and outside temps in a cheaper model	21
0	this item came to me and as much as i tried the only way i could view the numerals on the ceiling was to see them upside down there was no way to turn the unit so that it would project so that i could read it from my bed i tried placing it on both sides of the bed but that did n't work either it seemed to me the guts of the unit were placed in wrong and there is only one way to move the projector so i cannot recommend this item i sent it back	21
0	color shown as natural is far from accurate i am unhappy with color and may return these	21
0	after charging the batteries 1 of the 2000 mah batteries only had a capacity of 400 mah this means the whole 4 pack is no good	21
0	i purchased 8 of the aa batteries because of the low price of 4 99 for 4 the fine print on the battery indicates 1900 milliamps plus or minus 10 percent so the range would be 1710 to 2090 milliamps after many days of refreshing the battery in my la crosse bc 900 charger i ended up with the following 1634 milli amps1795170120011769178117541549so two of the cells are below spec earlier i had purchase some 2700 milliamp batteries from sanyo on amazon for about 12 99 per four all of them were within spec i'm glad i did n't pay a penny more than 4 99 for four	21
0	of 12 batteries i purchased 2 of them were leaking in the box i would rate these higher except that i also purchased 20 aaas and 12 of them were leaky i imagine i was just lucky that only 2 of this size leaked take the fact that most of these batteries will be bad when you compare prices i paid 4 99 4 pack which is a good price as long as more than half of them survive \( whick may not be very likely \)	21
0	i purchased two items at 4 99 each when i received them they were marked with store stickers at 1 98 each	21
0	i purchased all of the smoker chip flavors all of them except the hickory were worth it	21
0	the grill is up to webers usual high standards but i do have a couple of quibbles with it i bought the q grill because i needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv since every pound counts the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel but an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface i do n't have the time nor inclination to season a cast iron grill what i would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface	21
0	a year ago we bought a performance series and was very happy with it until a week ago when upon lighting it the fire spread out of the pit area and melted the controls char broil was unconcerned and indicated that did not sell replacement parts no comments whatsoever on the safety it seems that replaceing the grill on a yearly basis is expected at charbroil in the past we have used weber and got ten years from the grill i would look at the weber	21
0	i purchased this product in may 2006 however it is not working this year april 2007 i replaced the 40 watt bulb but it still does not work this is not a product worth the expense i would say that for less that 11 months of use 8 00 would be a high enough price to pay	21
0	i agree with the other reviewer buy flowtron instead my flowtron 40c lasted 20 years with the same bulb and never had a clogging problem with bugs for the same price the flowtron 40d is a much better buy	21
0	i recently bought the stinger uv15 it worked well for one month ! in that month i followed the recommendations for cleaning it and keeping it clear of dead bugs well just shy one month and the grid has completely failed so it attracts the bugs but does n't kill them this product is not worth the money	21
0	i purchased a 40 wt stinger insect killer from home depot last year and the bulb started shorting out after 3 months since it was near the end of the season i decided to store it and replace the bulb when i put it out in the spring the bulb was replaced but would only work intermitently insects also clogged it after a couple of days i gave up on it and recently purchased a flowtron bk 40 and it works great do n't waste your money buy a flowtron instead \( my last flowtron lasted over 20 years with the same bulb \)	21
0	i have bought and returned 1 2 and 1 acre stinger bug zappers from costco 4 times now in the past 3 years thank god i was buying from costco as stinger products are worthless light attracts them but zappers do n't work some worked for a week and others did n't zap at all i do n't know why costco carries such a terrible product i kept thinking maybe these were a bad batch and i will finally get a good product not so do not buy these products	21
0	i purchased one and it lasted about 3 months light still worked but did not kill any bugs attracted to it stinger replaced it under warranty this time it lasted one month same problem stinger replaced it again under warranty and the third one lasted 1 1 2 months again same problem will not go to the trouble to get it replaced again will buy a flowtron which i had used 5 or 6 years ago and which lasted for 2 3 years	21
0	i bought one of the custom tile 7 's \( loaded with options \) from california and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self destruct i tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years until they skipped to mexico tiles just did n't fall off they spalted the fire box broke etc when it got too bad to use and look at we had to throw it away a 1500 mistake if there was a really good ceramic cooker out there i would try it again they cook like a dream	21
0	i have one other weather station from la crosse that seems to work ok but this thing is a paperweight as far as i am concerned it shows that it is raining out when the sun is out ! it constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off i have attempted to contact la crosse but as other reviewers have said that is a lost cause they never answer any emails regarding product help or issues and no one seems to answer their phone either maybe i have a lemon but i feel for what they charge for their products la crosse should be more responsive to their customers	21
0	the clock was off by 4 hours even after so called rebooting i called tech support and they requested me to send the clock back to them at my cost so that they can pop the hands off and advance it four hours they should have replaced it for free but they did not i just think this clock is just a big hoax	21
0	i purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable when you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive if any water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys i am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai	21
0	the spring on these tongs broke on first use in september 2006 this renders them largely useless i purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired despite this assurance i am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective i returned them and i cannot recommend these tongs	21
0	we took a chance on these for part of a father 's day gift and the piece of metal that acts as a spring broke after only 1 use after reading the reviews i called the company instead of returning for a refund they were very nice and sent out another one this one just broke exactly like the other one after about a month of use the overall design of the tongs is great like other raichlen products but the construction is severely lacking do n't waste your money on this model	21
0	i spent several months and 5 purchases trying to find a good set of tongs for my husband who is the pickiest bbq expert these were one of the worst do not buy them the locking mechanism is clunky they do not open and close smoothly the oxo 16 inch tongs are much better and lighter you do want tongs that have a hinge vs the ones that are permanently open waiting for you to squeeze them around what you are trying to pick up good luck i had to send these back	21
0	i received a gift certificate in mid december for my birthday ordered this item the shipping date was pushed out several times this week it was bumped again with the expected possible date to ship now april 29 very disappointed i never received it i see so many others received it and have great reviews where was mine \?	21
0	i spent 3 hours putting this thing together all the parts were there and it all fit together okay after i finished i noticed that it seemed small for my deck i bought this unit becuase it says it measures 11'8 square well it actually measures 9'8 square so now i have to take it down box it up and start again	21
0	i bought this clock expecting it to show the humidity in a room show the temperature and to set itself for daylight savings it does neither of the above the temperature stays at 60 and the humidity measure it always way off in the same room i have an alarm clock that does all of the above accurately the clock is attractive and easy to read and it keeps time ok but it should do more i am very disappointed	21
0	i purchased this particular clock because it was described as an outdoor clock upon receipt of the clock i read the instruction book and under the section entitled frequently asked questions is the following q can a la cross technology clock be used outdoors \? a yes but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 f andd 131 f this clock is not water resistant living in new england we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 f the clock has a very misleading description	21
0	sorry to say this is not good for pets like it says my poor two cats as soon as i plugged them in they went running to a room that did not have them and would not come out please do not get if you have cats	21
0	i bought this product no long ago it never works mice still jump around and even make noise i call the company they do n't have technical report the product manual says once mice get used to the ultrasound it will not work i never heard about this from other company this company is very bad	21
0	if you have mice get a cat this product does absolutely nothing	21
0	i bought this unit and used it one time in a smoker and everything worked perfectly the next time i went to use it i found that the probe had failed replaced batteries and then checked probe with an ohmmeter and found it was open circuit so it cost me 20 to cook one meal my advice is to look elsewhere if you need a digital thermometer	21
0	i purchased two cushions to use on small chairs when the cushions i arrived i could hardly believe how small they were smaller than the description stated in addition to the small size the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions	21
0	the name on this item should be pillow it is much too small for a cushion they need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head i wish i had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before i ordered it lesson learned	21
0	way to small of a cushion had to purchase another one from a local store	21
0	i would not call this a chair cushion it is much too small more like a minature pillow for children	21

0	these outdoor window thermometers seemed like a good idea however they 're worthless ! the lcd display is not bright like shown in the picture the numbers are so light they are totally unreadable also the suction cups will not stay stuck to a cold window i'm returning them	21
0	not the manufacturer 's fault i blame u s congress for this the clock has an internal chip which did not recognize the earlier dst change this year there was going to be such a long delay before being able to get a replacement chip and or clock that we just returned the clocks disappointed	21
0	after leaving it on for an entire week in my new york apartment it never picked up the signal from fort collins colorado about 1800 miles away	21
0	i am sorry i bought this thing it 's way too complicated to set up and yes i read the instructions they only added to my frustration i would not recommend this product at all and will think 3 times before purchasing anything else from this manufacturer	21
0	this product was purchased as a christmas gift and unfortunately did not work as advertised the projection light only was operational when touched perhaps this was defective i have returned the product for a refund and am awaiting the refund	21
0	the unit is supposed to have a projection led the manual states that when the unit is plugged into ac outlet the projection alarm will continuously project the time this does not happen what good is the projection when in the middle of the night you have to find the clock find the right button and read the time befor the light goes out \? how do you trust a company like this	21
0	i bought this thing to solve a problem and i have a new one i red the little manual trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way it does not stay in projection mode if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button i change the battery i left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters and no way i wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection of course i do not recogmend it	21
0	the product promises good results but the instruction manual is very unfriendly and confusing and printed in such small fonts that one needs a magnifying glass to read it and a third hand to execute the steps that are indicated unfortunately as an average customer i have only two hands after several attempts i still have not been able to make the display light up permanently onto the ceiling i look forward to resolving that but the problem is that you need a combination of obscurity in the room to view the display on the ceiling but light on the instruction manual to read it	21
0	i bought a new grill and wanted to make sure it was used properly i do n't like it when small pieces of food fall through especially on gas grills so i bought this well on first use it stained so bad despite my priming it and worse it warped hey i can still use it but it 's kinda like wearing soiled clothes wo n't feel as good	21
0	all of the above reviews are correct they are nice looking and moderately functional i may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has the stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out at 10 99 however it was a great bargain and a 4 star rating at it 's current winter sale price of 16 99 however it is a 1 star rating i 'll average them weighting it 's current price and give it 2 stars	21
0	the turning weel is too small so the hose often falls off the stake is round and too short it wo n't stay in ground pretty much useless	21
0	i didn't receive the mat yet but i already ordered it i am disappointed to see others got the same item for 12 oo dollars and 9 99 but i am paying double the price	21
0	they were on sale and i ordered 2 they arrived separately in two huge boxes via ups and looked like they had both been dropped from about 10 stories up sigh the mats themselves had broken and cracked rubber backing i guess they got beaten up in transit the actual pattern in the mats is beautiful and the fiber is nice and dense so i kept them they are outside and hopefully they wo n't fall apart too quickly if you are really picky you better take a good look at these when they are delivered	21
0	i bought this in january and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around now it is an hour off \( one hour less than it should be \) and wo n't reset to daylight savings time there is a button that resets it if you do n't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall no reply from the manufacturer beautiful clock but useless half the year	21
0	this clock includes a chip that was designed to change the time when the new daylight savings time was effective the clock would not reset to the new time interestingly the manufacturer has not removed the clocks from inventory or attempted to inform buyers of the issue as of yet other than that it is a beautifull clock	21
0	i do n't own this clock but i do own one of it 's sister clocks the tambour style mantel clock and it did not change for dst now that the date has changed even though i 've owned my clock for all of a month and a half river city cuckoo clocks does not consider this fact to be a defect since i would assume that all their radio controlled clocks have the same electronics i would be very wary about buying this clock	21
0	sounds like a great item but since i never received it i can not give it an honest review	21
0	the product was as advertised easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since i installed it so far it does not appear to have affected the mole population however to be fair it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device \( instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil although the critters have dug quite close to it \) to be really bend over backwards fair i suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles although the telltale signs are exactly what i understand mole tunnels to look like	21
0	warning to all potential buyers ! this product is a total farce i bought four of these and placed them way closer than the required maximum distance and yes i put brand new duracells in these things the moles actually burrowed right next to thems save your money and buy the old fashioned traps that actually kill the moles these things do n't work	21
0	i read the mixed reviews on this site before purchasing so it 's my own fault for still going ahead and purchasing ! i was hopeful the product would work for me i 've tried 3 of these in different locations in my yard all with the same result mounds of dirt leading right up to the molechaser ! they seem attracted to it not turned off by it i only wish i could upload a photo of the dirt mounds that literally are less than an inch away from each device ! this product has done nothing to discourage moles voles etc in all three locations the lawn damage continues do n't make the same mistake i did look for another solution rather than this product	21
0	do n't waste your money i bought two of these a few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year i put one in my gardern a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight ! total waste of money like everthing else i 've tried except nash loop traps	21
0	ordered 4 new units and out of the box they do not work not unless you hold the unit in your hand when placed in canister they stop had great luck with the product in the past the manufacture must be outsourcing to cut corners moles are digging around the units placed in yard looking for another brand that works	21
0	you have heard the old expression that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is \? this product is proof of that i really wanted to avoid poison and traps so i thought i would try this p o s to solve my gopher problem humanely sure i was skeptical but some buyers reported success after 4 weeks i can report that my gophers are utterly and completely indifferent to this product i noticed some buyers experienced a surge in activity but i have seen nothing nada zip numerous fat happy gophers before numerous fat happy gophers after caveat emptor	21
0	bought two ran them all spring at opposite ends of the lawn absolutely no help not worth any money at all	21
0	radio shack programmed it for me friends who had atomic clocks and the directions could n't even set and turn off the alarm	21
0	be carful where you place it must be put in a shady place or it reads crazy ! hard to read if sun is hitting it and obviously ca n't be seen at night	21
0	temp reading constantly off by minimum of 10 degrees i was warned	21
0	warmth from window affects thermometer ! d'oh ! it 's totally inaccurate on single pane glazing very inaccurate on dual pane glazing and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri rigged 6 extender from dual pane glass the nature of windows being a big source of heat loss means this thermometer is measuring warm ambient air not actual outside temperature	21
0	the major problem with this device is its placement location in proximity to the indoors e g on a window the indoor temp seems to affect the outdoor temp reading by anywhere from 3 to 7 degrees would be better if it had a wire probe that extended further from the device returned item do n't waste your money	21
0	i got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look after eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke we are not overweight people \( 140 190lb \) very sad that we have to replace them because we were happy with appearance	21
0	amazon com usually ships this within 24 hours \? it 's been over a week the item is still supposedly in stock and it still has n't shipped it 's a great product but buy it elsewhere	21
0	i bought this weather station along with two remote sensors after about two days i was skeptical about the inside humidity \( reading 4 \) to test the accuracy i placed the remote sensors side by side with this unit the temp seems to all be in sync but i get different humidity readings on all three this morning was 4 27 and 31 i have no idea which one is correct i'm going to return this product	21
0	i keep an indoor garden and i need accurate readings it is of poor quality and unreliable do n't buy this	21
0	if you 're looking for an accurate hygrometer this is n't it ! it was 15 points off when i tested it for accuracy ! amazon is taking back as defective so i'm glad i bought it at amazon	21
0	just received this item purchased on 11 21 unfortunately at that time there were no reviews on it again as previous reviews state item is not a professional outdoor cooker as listed still but a commercial grade cooker this printed right on the box features have now been changed orginally stated included with an aluminum basket and fish fry pot basket i received the items as listed now all in all it does appear to be a nice cooker but i bought it for the versitiliy of the features listed previously contacting customer service on this misleading advertisement	21
0	as was the case with the previous reviewer i did not receive the item that was described it is not a professional outdoor cooker but a commercial grade cooker in addition there are no baskets included this set up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment what you 'll get is what is shown in the picture not what is described	21
0	i ordered two of these sets and was not sent what is described there is no large aluminum basket and no fish fry basket included the description says it is professional grade but i received commercial grade customer service has offered to send me out a replacement but i am assuming the same thing will happen again it seems as if amazon attached the wrong picture and description to this item beware if you want everything that is listed that's not what you will get	21
0	do yourself a favor and buy a real heavy duty bbq mitt this one looks nice and fits well but it starting burning one night and i threw it out	21
0	there is a reason this mitt is relatively cheap the shape of it is very strange it does not fit my hands at all i have fairly wide hands and this mitt feels very ackward it is tight to get into and the thumb is too short i would return it except the postage would cost me more than the mitt did i would suggest you buy in person someplace where you can put your hands in it first	21
0	this is the second weber mitt that i 've tried they both burned through within two weeks there are other heavier duty mitts avaiable that will last a lot longer	21
0	i found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use you ca n't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on you can move hot plates etc but you ca n't really carry anything with the mitt on not worth the money albeit not very expensive	21
0	these mitts are good quality problem is that the thumbs are way to short and narrow rendering these mitts virtually useless do yourself a favor and go to a store where you can try stuff like this before you buy	21
0	while the mitt is beautiful and the price is right it is narrow most mitts flare towards the opening this one does not i have larger forearms and it wo n't fit all the way up my husband has average sized arms and it wo n't go around his upper forearm either since they are so long they go almost to your elbow	21
0	a pretty simple device not really a waterfall concept of any kind the water just plops into the first cup until it overflows into the next etc nothing runs down the chain i suppose you could try to direct the water but it usually depends on the flow it 's mostly an asthetic piece	21
0	this thing is terrible it only caught a few unlucky moths who accidentally got stuck inside meanwhile mosquitoes were everywhere not getting caught in the catcher	21
0	notice that the people giving it 5 stars are the people who reviewed this product and this product alone sounds like employees trying to build up ratings	21
0	i tried it as recommended for over 4 weeks and then some i didnot see any reduction in the number of mosquitoes actually thereseemed to be more in the same area where the unit was installed i did try different locations perhaps they are attracted to it but they are not being sucked in looking at the tray it did kill a bunch of other harmless flying insects	21
0	the projection was too small and not bright enough the clock was a pain in the neck to set i have many of these type clocks and this one was a dissapointment i returned it	21
0	the rion mini lean to greenhouse comes in a flimsy cardboard box that contains about a hundred plastic parts it difficult to put together because the parts are poorly labeled \( making it even more difficult for me was that several parts were missing \) the 12 page instruction manual shows several diagrams but no photos with parts labelled to help with assembly one classic exerpt on page 7 the 'out' on the 2d connector should face the inside of the mini lean to this kind of product gives the term some assembly required a bad name also it 's a bit pricely to be so flimsy and poorly designed save yourself the trouble get something else	21
0	i bought this off amazon 4 years ago and while it is very comfortable it does not stand the test of time within the first year it started to rust and the cording is very stretched out i 've had better luck with a cheaper knockoff i bought at bj 's	21
0	like other reviewers initially i was impressed with these very stylish and comfortable chairs however after 1 year outside \( in colorado \) the rubber on the arms was all cracked and peeling and the cords were frayed the overall appearance was of a much older chair of course it happened to be my mother in law who sat in one of the chairs when it gave way a second chair 's cord gave way shortly afterwards	21
0	the sun will rot this chair in two years ! !	21
0	how can someone use this for cooking \? \? \? the instructions about keeping it for do n't know how long in the oven to start working outrageus either i do n't know to use dutch ovens or all the previous reviews are written by the sellers	21
0	what a joke not worth the money i put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through swapped batteries pulled it out washed it and looked at all the parts it was either used and resold to me by amazon or it was defective from the start and since they have a 30 day return policy i am now stuck with it i will see what eastman says next very disappointing i will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it	21
0	the picture of this curtain makes it look thicker than it really is \( by a long shot \) it does not screen out unwanted pests birds and harsh sunlight well maybe birds but certainly not bugs or light there are large gaps between each strand of beads and it 's completely see through this is not what you are looking for if you want a little privacy on a positive note amazon made the return very easy	21
0	the thermometer looks good and is easy to use unfortunately the temperature it gave was so inaccurate \( more than two degrees off \) that i had to return the product	21
0	very poor construction to the point where i had to return it to the manufacturer pre assembled bench seat had been over tightened so that metal screws were portruding through wood into seating area aesthetically unappealing because of the diverse colors of the wood definately would not reccomend this product	21
0	roaster was cracked up one side i returned it and the second one was also cracked up one side i returned that one as well this item is extremely heavy and is very rustic iron aside from the crack it was not what i expected or wanted	21
0	i purchased this in january and finally got a chance to use it for easter it never registered a reading from the meat i was cooking now i'm stuck with an expensive timer if you 're thinking of purchasing this wireless thermometer think twice	21
0	i do n't think this product works i installed 2 of them and my rooms are not that big i saw a mouse even after that i think i will have to engage professional pest control if you are buying to control rodents do n't bother to waste yr money	21
0	these devices tested by the fda decades ago \( including the ones with variable and intermittent pitches \) do not work there have been a number of class action lawsuits against the companies that sell these they simply do n't and ca n't work against insects or rodents it 's science	21
0	totally not worth it ! i was shocked to see spiders crawling across the stupid thing more than once ! it does n't work i 've had it for several months and i am still seeing bugs all over the place	21
0	this was the worst purchase i 've ever made in my crusade against the ants and spiders that have taken over my home ! i have more pests now than i did before actually had ants crawling on one of the repeller units if you 're thinking about buying this product don't waste your money you 'd be better off with a couple of cans of raid	21
0	absolutely useless the three gizmos are in three small adjoining areas kitchen breakfast office areas the roaches come out at night and do a little dance to the clicks that the gizmos emit no effect whatsoever after 3 months	21
0	very disappointed purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the spring and summer time well i think these units invite the ants in we 've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room etc these devices do not phase them at all they continue to parade right by	21
0	i was hoping it would repel roaches a common problem in nyc but this thing absolutely does nothing ! ! in the two weeks i used it three bugs wondered into my place in the vicinity of this pest repeller besides you can hear the ticking noise of this device very well like a clock	21
0	do n't fall for the false advertising lentek got sued by the ftc for making false claims http www ftc gov opa 2002 08 lentek ht	21
0	i used another version of this device in college and found that it worked well this product has not even phased the roaches in my house and to add insult to injury it makes an annoying ticking sound like a clock in every room of my house	21
0	once again probably a great product but since i never received it i can not give it a fair rating	21
0	i have rated this a 1 star because i have yet to receive the product that i ordered in november b r from st louis	21
0	we need a little more information the chair looks great ! but what kind of material is it constructed from \? how big is it \? a side view would be helpful also to see how the back curves the price is good now if i just knew a little more	21
0	ordered the stainless flavorizer bars for a genisis 1000 which is supposed to be 13 bars what i received were 5 porcelain bars for a completely different model	21
0	how do you expect someone to purchase this item if they do n't know its dimensions please get with the program ! !	21
0	i bought this over a different product because i liked the smiley face frowny face options they do n't even work the frowning face is on there all the time regardless of the weather it 's kind of depressing also i think it 's off by about 1 degree in general	21
0	this product malfunctioned from the get go i was unable to get it working for that price it 's a shame you can purchase one of those multifuntionclock thermometer for less than 5 i would give this product 0 star	21
0	i have have had this item for 6 months and tried to change the time since it did not update itself for daylight savings i waited about 15 minutes to reinstall the batteries when i did there was no time display i waited for possible transmission overnight and positioned it to the north and the south sky still no time i changed the batteries several times no results i will never buy this brand again	21
0	this item was a disapointment looks great in the picture but is cheaply made peices of the wicker were coming loose the item is also very short i am 5ft 10 and my feet stick off the end by a couple of inches i guess you get what you pay for if you spend 800 1000 you will get much better construction and at the end of the day will last longer than this	21
0	this tray does not fit nicely inside the tool box grill it is about 2 inches short on the end and about a 1 2 inch too narrow this causes it to slide and bang around inside the grill when transported the tools have a very cheap feel to them the tongs were the worst the handles are loose and they are prety much useless the knife wo n't hold an edge the spatula and tongs are marginal i would not recommend this item	21
0	the bars were represented to be 25 inches long in fact they measured 22 amp 9 16 inches long the required length is 23 amp 7 16 inches in either case they wo n't fit i am in process or returning	21
0	bought a pair of these chairs to use at the beach my chair collapsed within an hour on the first day at the beach while i was sitting in it reading the mechanism for the recline positions is made of soft and cheap plastic and will not hold for long i'm 200 lbs my wife 's chair showed signs of the same bent plastics and she 's only 110 lbs i returned them and will buy new ones with metal mechanisms	21
0	as a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the sw i can say that red or any other color dye is nonsense ! not needed quite likely harmful also i question the instant nectar instructions say it does n't require boiling is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth \? if so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers it could harm their natural internal flora	21
0	this product does not state what they use for the red coloring intheir nectar it is a well known fact that red dye 40 has provedharmful to hummingbirds causing cancer and is not necessary natural nectar in the wild is clear without color using a colorfulfeeder will attract the hummers and not harm them	21
0	you wo n't find a single expert on hummingbirds who recommends instant nectar products such as this one why \? because 1 \) they 're a complete waste of your money and 2 \) they expose the birds to ridiculously high concentrations of inadequately tested chemicals the cheapest and easiest feeder solution also happens to be the closest in chemical composition to natural flower nectar a solution of 3 or 4 parts water to one part ordinary white sugar if you want the sugar to dissolve faster get additive free superfine baking sugar don't use honey food coloring kool aid jello or any other junk the birds drink nectar just for the energy and get everything else their bodies need from eating insects	21
0	not at all what i expected i started to install it and a light wind blew causing the structure to fall and bending it i know its not an expensive product but i expected a better quality also i recieved it with some of the curtain hooks broken i am going to return it	21
0	i received a painful injury and almost lost my finger to this recliner i grabbed the arm rest and tried to slide back into the recliner the mechanism under the arm rest snapped closed on my finger i could not get out of this trap had my wife not been there to help i would have lost my finger no way should this chair be sold to an unsuspecting public !	21
0	this item is not as functional as i thought i miscalculated the size which is not big enough for my purpose also the brittle like surface is cracking and peeling off i was going to exchange or return the item but the packaging was discarded too soon	21
0	i did not get the crossover tube in the box like the picture shows i had do modify one of the tubes so it would work with my old crossover go to weber in the future to get what you need its worth the extra money	21
0	i got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look after eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke we are not overweight people \( 140 190lb \) very sad that we have to replace them because we were happy with appearance	21
0	my husband was so excited when he got this station and could not wait to get it set up he is a phone guy so he wired it all up under the house and spent many hours setting it up just right only to have issues withthe wind barameter we have tried to trouble shoot with the online andhandwritten manuals unfortunetly there is no one to contact nor is there an option to return this product once you have it out of the box sooooo needless to say theexcitement is gone	21
0	i called weber to verify the basket fits my genesis silver b model and weber factory customer service informed me this item does not fit my model which they had registered and knew what model i was referencing the guidance on many weber accessories is incorrect according to what weber customer service reps are telling customers either weber cs is wrong or the weber person filling in the detail on the items is wrong i strongly suggest weber managment cross check all detail on amazon for accuracy and or straighten out their service reps this was a bad experience and occurred on multiple accessories i was trying to buy	21
0	even at a cheap price its not worth it spend a few more and get a better machin	21
0	i am already on my second unit i managed to get three uses out of the first one i should have ordered the second when i saw the first one start smoking halfway through draining the turkey fryer \( no the oil was not hot it was at room temp ! \) the only reason i gave a second star is that it did work well once i really wish eastman would re design this to make it durable i 've given up and use pvc tubing from home depot and a funnel with cheesecloth to get the residuals out good luck to anyone who wants to use this a second time	21
0	you should remove this merchant they have numerous complaints on multiple websites i ignored it and trusted amazon 's brand however my experience was horrible they over charged me and when i called to rectify the issue they were n't interested in trying to solve the problem but simply place blame on me then the service rep hung up on me i 'll never do business with them again	21
0	the material and construction are good i purchased this because the ad said it would fit a 9' tree the bag is 6' long	21
0	i have two units and two sensors i thought they would all be compatible i just received this sensor yesterday and find it works alone but is n't compatible with my units i wish i had checked this out more carefully before i purchased it	21
0	one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector 's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a 10 tie for his birthday	21
0	radio reception is bad in the city so i was n't surprised when the clock did n't set itself to set it manually the instructions say to hold down the snooze button for 3 seconds and the time will flash it did n't	21
0	ugh ! i agree this thing is never going to ship ! ! i am now looking at similar products not happy about this at all	21
0	shipping in 4 to 6 weeks \? try 4 months \( maybe \) ! after waiting 6 weeks for it to be shipped i am now told it will be another month or two before it ships a christmas present is turning out to be more of an easter present and no explanation given for the delay i ca n't love the headphones if i never see them	21
0	if you read the label on this stuff it says 100 sucrose and that is what this stuff is plain and simple sugar you 're basically paying 10 dollars for something you could get at a grocery store for 1 50 this is a rip off ! there is nothing special about this stuff in terms of size color everything ! ! ! just buy sugar ! ! ! ! !	21
0	this product to my knowledge is completely untested i suspect it because it says it requires no boiling which sugestes that it may contain a preservative yeast and or bacterial inhibitor this could not possibly be good for the hummers listen to the experts such as sheri wlliamson \( peterson 's hummingbirds of north america \) sugar and water is just fine filtered water best but not distilled	21
0	the description of features claim the clock records outdoor temperature amp it has no such feature	21
0	when i bought this product it was said to be new ! however upon opening the package it arrived in the cooker was in an already opened inner box i though that perhaps someone just opened the inner box to check the item before it was sent \? as i opened the inner box one of the legs on the cooker was broken off and rusted ! i needed to use this right away so i did not send it back now i will have to get this leg welded back on ! beware of the new designation !	21
0	no matter where i set my temperature controls on the grill this thermometer always reads the temp at 500 degrees or more i placed the thermometer in our oven and set the oven for 350 degrees yet the thermometer showed the temp at 450 500 i have called taylor 's customer service on several occasions and they never bother to call back i would never buy another taylor product	21
0	i received the lacrosse weather station as a gift it started out working ok for about 4 weeks plagued by software and communication problems i do not recomend it to anyone the tecnical support team is of little or no help it all goes back to that old saying you get what you pay for a very dissatisified customer	21
0	i have had the unit for about 3yrs rain guage was repaired once did n't work one more year just had a storm with 50 mile an hour winds i watched the wind guage it showed 18 miles an hour need i say more !	21
0	nothing but trouble in the long run anemometer replaced twice under warranty now broken again just as the storms build up sending unit no longer sends temp humidity even with new batts	21
0	i just tried filling my propane tank with the quick disconnect connector and was told by the dealer that this type of connector has now been banned by the government and he could not fill my tank i called weber and they confirmed this probably a safety concern although i never had a problem i will now need to replace my grill lp hose with the screw on type of connector \( qcc1 connection \)	21
0	shame on me ! i should have read the reviews before i purchased this piece of garbage i had the same experience as others cumbersome to fill trouble attaching to the window then the whole thing crashes to the deck an atractive price until you find you 're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped not to mention the poor quality design could n't give me another one of these	21
0	this hummingbird feeder looked like a good idea until i filled it \( following the direction \) and put it up on the window and it fell off 15 seconds later and the glass busted	21
0	much better versions out there and it is always better to pay a little more and get the good one then conserve for a disposable mode	21

0	i was dissappointed with this product it had freyed and untied hammock strings when i got it out of the box as pricey as it originally was i expected at least a swing that was manufactured well but this is terrible it looked like it was n't even completely assembled	21
0	i purchased this swing the first one that i received had a defective weaving the cords came apart i got a replacement since then i have had the swing out and have barely used it this summer when i tried to sit in it the rope gave away and i fell down note that this swing was barely sat in	21
0	i bought two of this bite shield there is a small fan to blow out some smell of chemical the mosquito does n't care about the smell i was surrounded by mosquitoes and got bite the same as without this product there is almost no wind it is really disappointed	21
0	i received this watch as a gift after reviewing several others the display is very good the altimiter is usually way off and varies greatly even remaining in the same position it is a little difficult to make use of all the watch 's features i am very concerned the watch is stamped on the back water resistant but new reports are showing it is not in fact if it is not we have been misled by the manufacturer overall i can not recommend this watc	21
0	i had this watch for a few months and feature wise it meets all my expectations but i snagged it in my backpack the other day and the strap with the pins came off no big deal i thought i 'll just snap it back in that 's when i noticed that the strap holder had ripped through the plastic casing and was thus unrepairable over the few months i have had it it has also discolored badly on the fake metal casing great features poor build quality not recommended	21
0	does not function refusal of cutomer service to replace product phone service non existent rebot online service offered no recourse i will be contacting my attorney general in regards to their fraudulent warranty and will never purchase fromj amazon until they drop this compan	21
0	i currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds i love the way this one looks but the birds do n't feed from it and i'm not sure why the other one will be empty and they still do n't come to this one	21
1	i use this bbq with mesquite lump charcoal and have grilled excellent steaks and smoked some pork ribs a chicken a london broil and a giant hamburger so far no marinade just a dry rub and on the grill the book included has accurate cook times as long as you keep the temperature needle on the i in ideal for as much of the cook time as possible which is not hard to do make sure to cure it before you use it this burns off all the smells and chemicals that are in it from the manufacturing cure it using the propane burner easy to assemble too	21
1	i 've had one of these smokers for 4 to 5 years i 'd buy another one if my current wears out well well worth the price this cooks the best chicken turkey and above all salmon that i 've ever tasted try marinating salmon filets overnight in teriyaki and smoking for 45 to 60 minutes with alder chips for the most moist flavorful salmon you 've ever tasted	21
1	purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews i have found the basket to work great you put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces very easy with rock cornish game hens though i needed to tie them a little bit but that is because the little legs are well little never had one before just the skewer kind cleans fairly easy too love it	21
1	i got this to go with my new silver b weber and i had the best chicken and ribs that i 've had in a very very long time it is extremely simple to assemble operate and most importantly to clean i 've had two different rotisserie ovens that i dreaded to use based on the cleaning factor alone cleaning this is quick and easy the small parts get clean by simply placing in hot soapy water in the sink i plan on using this a lot	21
1	just to make sure people do n't make the same mistake i did be aware that this is not compatible with the weber q 200 silver portable propane gas grill amazon com lists this rotisserie as an accessory for the weber q 200 so it is amazon that deserves a low rating so i have just given this the current average of 4 stars	21
1	weber products are well made and the 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie is no exception the 'basket' style is a nice design	21
1	the drawback is you ca n't grill at the same time you use the rotisserie but it works wonderfully ! delicious	21
1	this is a nice rotisserie it could use another basket to keep the meat from getting away from it as it cooks \( and shrinks in the process \) you will need pliers to tighten and loosen the baskets	21
1	it works in new jersey just wait a night before you say something else	21
1	no longer is my wall clock wrong because of power shortages or because i failed to set it or reset it correctly	21
1	we got the clock read the instructions installed a battery and hung it on an east west wall after the sun went down the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time it has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it it 's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids do n't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off	21
1	brush works well and is large enough to keep you from burning your hands metal attachment is perfect size for cleaning weber grates you ca n't go wrong with this product at the amazon price	21
1	i give this 5 stars because the price was right for a name brand it works it is no better or worse than any other grille brushes that i 've used	21
1	this brush is just awesome and a good price to boot ! works perfect with my weber q grill	21
1	the brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then the brush has a strong wooden handle leather loop a sturdy set of bristles and a grill scraper for tough jobs be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12 inch one does not have the reach especially for larger grills	21
1	this little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink it scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean sturdier than any other brush i or my family has used the one we have now has lasted quite a long time it cleans each rail on the grate beautifully the wood on the handle will become dirty so keep it clean	21
1	the item is great quality and will last for a long time does exactly what i intended it to do	21
1	the clock set itself right away during the daytime and it performed very well from that point on all i had to do is put a battery in it and hang it on the wall facing the general direction of colorado and i experienced no problems with it then or now i would advise anyone to get one of these clocks since they perform well and are accurate	21
1	this clock set itself within a few minutes and has worked well for the few months that we 've had it i loved not having to climb up and get it down to re set it for daylight savings time ! just so you know this clock is not silver in color \( i thought it was from the picture \) it 's more of a pearlized off white	21
1	needs to be near a window to get the time signal	21
1	received after a weeks time per amazon this was supposed to be in stock and shipped immediately clock is working good there is no instruction maunal in the packag	21
1	pop a battery in and forget it it sets itself and was right on the dot even after daylight savings time came in	21
1	i 've bought two of these atomic clocks the first a 12 wood framed model soon stopped keeping accurate time and started acting unpredictably the second this model has been on my wall for a week and is keeping good time after an easy setup insert battery push est button i am nicking it a star because it makes a noticeable tick sound in a quiet room making it inappropriate for a bedroom	21
1	does it have radium so that we can see time in dark during night without turning light on	21
1	really goes good in my room i really like that it automatically synchronise as per the time zone and daytime savings	21
1	i found no issues i put the battery in and hit et it set and is keeping great time	21
1	have purchased 2 of these for my office and am buying 2 more for home these are easy to set up easy to read and the self adjusting daylight savings time with the atomic function \( self setting \) is wonderful earlier reviewer mentioned how to reset when battery needs replacement which i found very helpful so keep the set up instructions handy to refer to if and when you need to replace the batteries ! also purchased 2 of the larger 14 inch version and they 're just as nice	21
1	this is a great clock looks good makes no noise and very easy to read setup should be simple but i would suggest adding a button to change from manual to automatic you usually do n't get the clock at midnight and you want to setup it right from the beginning since it 's not going to be able to sync early in the afternoon you want to set the time manually and leave the clock to sync at night but this is where an additional button comes in handy cause moving the hands is done with the same button and its hard to know if the clock was left on automatic or not	21
1	i have purchased 2 of these clocks now the moment i inserted the batteries in the clock started advancing and stopped at 4 'o' clock i was getting ready to ship it back thinking that it was a bad clock but within 5 minutes both the clocks received the transmission and corrected themselves to exact time so moral of the story is do n't return the clocks without giving it some time as it looks like these clocks stop at 4 and does n't move at all till it receives the time	21
1	in considering that i purchased this item for my bedroom i would have to say that it is perfect for aesthetic reasons i preferred an analog wall clock but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until i found this item by lacrosse it could not be anymore perfect as its looks price and self \( time \) adjusting qualities has made this an m f \( major find \) now i can sleep through the daylight savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock but whether or not i will be an hour early or late to work	21
1	someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag it is not it is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time	21
1	the cover is exactly what i needed to protect our smoker from the weather it is strong and appears to be durable i felt that the price was fair for this product	21
1	the description does n't do this rib rack justice this thing is pretty big and will hold a lot of chicken you will certainly not complain about running out of room ! even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood there 's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8 washing it may be a problem just wash it immediately after using it	21
1	keeps the ribs from searing lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib	21
1	this is a good rack it cleaned pretty easily and a nice compact size but the ribs are just a bit too close together \( i cook mainly full spare ribs \) i have rib racks from steven raichlen that are perfect the more spacious racks allow for better basting heat distribution and more even cooking when the meat touches like in the weber rack the meat does n't cook as well	21
1	i had purchased a brinkman electric smoker and needed some rib racks i looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from amazon \( which included free shipping since i purchased 2 racks \) i bought 6 racks of ribs cutting each rack in half they all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs clean up was easy too all the grease came off and they are ready to use again good construction on the racks i definetly got my money 's worth on this product	21
1	i have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review the rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do i have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my weber kettle and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke if this happens i may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since i'm not entering anything in a competition ! everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color	21
1	i have a weber q bbq grill and if you are cooking a lot of ribs you can handle a lot more by placing them in this rack and still have room for hot dogs and or hamburgers plus it keeps the ribs from sticking	21
1	great looking and quite large easy to see from a distance though the other two dials are correspondingly small updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate i wish that i had a dozen of them the price is very reasonable also i certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually	21
1	we bought this clock to use indoors living in florida our power service is n't always reliable especially during hurricane season so having a battery operated atomic clock is perfect for us ! when folks visit they always comment on how nice the clock looks the bronze finish is muted and it does n't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures and for 45 and no shipping we could n't beat the price on ebay overstock com or any onther online companies in other words we 're very pleased with our purchase	21
1	i love this clock ! it 's big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it 's sheltered from the rain that 's about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles	21
1	this is a great little barbecue from carne asadaa to teryaki flank ribs this little guy does a great job	21
1	this grill works great everytime ! the only problem i have is with the lighter but it is not a big deal easy to use and always give a great grilling experiences	21
1	used it for a tri tip last night and it came out wonderfully cranked on high to initially heat it up then we left it on low and it kept the 400 degrees no problem \( it actually got too hot according to my instant read thermometer ! \) some of the complaints here say that the burner is too loose that 's because they used the wrong washer to mount it ! there 's one washer that 's larger than the others use the wrong one and it 'll be loose	21
1	this grill is a great alternative to the expensive larger q grills perfect for an entry level weber for an apartment etc the only thing i can think of that i dont care for is the handle gets very hot so be careful	21
1	works great cooking space on grill holds a large amount of meat fish etc we would like to see a canister that holds more gas than for cooking only five meals	21
1	we bought this for use at a beach house the grills provided at the houses are always dreadful it worked perfectly to grill shrimp hamburgers and hot dogs it is easy to transport and easy to use with very little assembly required	21
1	purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews i have found the basket to work great you put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces very easy with rock cornish game hens though i needed to tie them a little bit but that is because the little legs are well little never had one before just the skewer kind cleans fairly easy too love it	21

1	we had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves \( and we know our directionals here \) so if you get it just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up	21
1	brush works well and is large enough to keep you from burning your hands metal attachment is perfect size for cleaning weber grates you ca n't go wrong with this product at the amazon price	21

1	i 've had one of these smokers for 4 to 5 years i 'd buy another one if my current wears out well well worth the price this cooks the best chicken turkey and above all salmon that i 've ever tasted try marinating salmon filets overnight in teriyaki and smoking for 45 to 60 minutes with alder chips for the most moist flavorful salmon you 've ever tasted	21
1	the clock set itself right away during the daytime and it performed very well from that point on all i had to do is put a battery in it and hang it on the wall facing the general direction of colorado and i experienced no problems with it then or now i would advise anyone to get one of these clocks since they perform well and are accurate	21
1	needs to be near a window to get the time signal	21
1	received after a weeks time per amazon this was supposed to be in stock and shipped immediately clock is working good there is no instruction maunal in the packag	21
1	i 've bought two of these atomic clocks the first a 12 wood framed model soon stopped keeping accurate time and started acting unpredictably the second this model has been on my wall for a week and is keeping good time after an easy setup insert battery push est button i am nicking it a star because it makes a noticeable tick sound in a quiet room making it inappropriate for a bedroom	21
1	does it have radium so that we can see time in dark during night without turning light on	21
1	really goes good in my room i really like that it automatically synchronise as per the time zone and daytime savings	21
1	have purchased 2 of these for my office and am buying 2 more for home these are easy to set up easy to read and the self adjusting daylight savings time with the atomic function \( self setting \) is wonderful earlier reviewer mentioned how to reset when battery needs replacement which i found very helpful so keep the set up instructions handy to refer to if and when you need to replace the batteries ! also purchased 2 of the larger 14 inch version and they 're just as nice	21
1	this is a great clock looks good makes no noise and very easy to read setup should be simple but i would suggest adding a button to change from manual to automatic you usually do n't get the clock at midnight and you want to setup it right from the beginning since it 's not going to be able to sync early in the afternoon you want to set the time manually and leave the clock to sync at night but this is where an additional button comes in handy cause moving the hands is done with the same button and its hard to know if the clock was left on automatic or not	21
1	i have purchased 2 of these clocks now the moment i inserted the batteries in the clock started advancing and stopped at 4 'o' clock i was getting ready to ship it back thinking that it was a bad clock but within 5 minutes both the clocks received the transmission and corrected themselves to exact time so moral of the story is do n't return the clocks without giving it some time as it looks like these clocks stop at 4 and does n't move at all till it receives the time	21
1	in considering that i purchased this item for my bedroom i would have to say that it is perfect for aesthetic reasons i preferred an analog wall clock but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until i found this item by lacrosse it could not be anymore perfect as its looks price and self \( time \) adjusting qualities has made this an m f \( major find \) now i can sleep through the daylight savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock but whether or not i will be an hour early or late to work	21
1	i am using the product for my charbroil grill caddy it is a decent fit however with the colder weather the material has become more stiff we 'll have to see how it weathers over the cold months	21
1	someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag it is not it is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time	21
1	the cover is exactly what i needed to protect our smoker from the weather it is strong and appears to be durable i felt that the price was fair for this product	21
1	the description does n't do this rib rack justice this thing is pretty big and will hold a lot of chicken you will certainly not complain about running out of room ! even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood there 's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8 washing it may be a problem just wash it immediately after using it	21
1	keeps the ribs from searing lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib	21
1	this is a good rack it cleaned pretty easily and a nice compact size but the ribs are just a bit too close together \( i cook mainly full spare ribs \) i have rib racks from steven raichlen that are perfect the more spacious racks allow for better basting heat distribution and more even cooking when the meat touches like in the weber rack the meat does n't cook as well	21
1	i had purchased a brinkman electric smoker and needed some rib racks i looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from amazon \( which included free shipping since i purchased 2 racks \) i bought 6 racks of ribs cutting each rack in half they all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs clean up was easy too all the grease came off and they are ready to use again good construction on the racks i definetly got my money 's worth on this product	21
1	i have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review the rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do i have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my weber kettle and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke if this happens i may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since i'm not entering anything in a competition ! everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color	21
1	bought this to use with my weber smokey mountain i almost bought a sunbeam rib rack for half the price at the local home improvement chain but it seemed a lot flimsier this rack is solid and built with weber quality the one reason i ca n't give it 5 stars is because the sunbeam rack has skewers for potatoes and i would really like to see that on this rack if the ribs are too big i just wrap them around the wrap quite easily	21
1	i bought this clock for my pool deck and it works great it set itself within 10 minutes of putting the battery in i have it on a wall that has an overhang that is about 4 feet so it is protected from the weather you can see it well from across the yard have had several comments from visitors they think its a great outdoor clock the thermometer is not automatically set you need to set it it seems to work fine i have checked it a couple of times with the local temperature on the radio tv would recommend the clock to those looking for an outdoor time piece	21
1	great looking and quite large easy to see from a distance though the other two dials are correspondingly small updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate i wish that i had a dozen of them the price is very reasonable also i certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually	21
1	we bought this clock to use indoors living in florida our power service is n't always reliable especially during hurricane season so having a battery operated atomic clock is perfect for us ! when folks visit they always comment on how nice the clock looks the bronze finish is muted and it does n't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures and for 45 and no shipping we could n't beat the price on ebay overstock com or any onther online companies in other words we 're very pleased with our purchase	21
1	i love this clock ! it 's big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it 's sheltered from the rain that 's about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles	21
1	i use a table top grill about 65 days a year the only one i can depend on is the weber the only reason i replace it is when mine get stolen	21
1	this is a great little barbecue from carne asadaa to teryaki flank ribs this little guy does a great job	21
1	used it for a tri tip last night and it came out wonderfully cranked on high to initially heat it up then we left it on low and it kept the 400 degrees no problem \( it actually got too hot according to my instant read thermometer ! \) some of the complaints here say that the burner is too loose that 's because they used the wrong washer to mount it ! there 's one washer that 's larger than the others use the wrong one and it 'll be loose	21
1	this grill is a great alternative to the expensive larger q grills perfect for an entry level weber for an apartment etc the only thing i can think of that i dont care for is the handle gets very hot so be careful	21
1	while we 've used coleman folding stoves for years if you have trunk space there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill the small tank makes this practical for camping if you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available this is a great choice for camping equipment we still like the coleman for boiling water but i love barbecuing on a propane grill like this	21
1	we bought this for use at a beach house the grills provided at the houses are always dreadful it worked perfectly to grill shrimp hamburgers and hot dogs it is easy to transport and easy to use with very little assembly required	21
1	the umbrella i ordered is fine just what i had hoped it would be however i subsequently ordered an umbrella stand \( after you prompted me to do so \) and when it arrived the two tightening screws in the shaft had been damaged in shipment each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off as a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin i have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store any suggestions	21
1	these are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed i like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella very low tech and smart my one issue with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for they are totally stationary and do n't have a tilting feature that might be standard i just do n't know but i would have wanted that flexibility oh and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible and they 're simple to put together and take apart great price and they block the sun and look terrific	21
1	had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms \? try this one ! very nice design looks great simulated wood finish pole easy open and close we are very satisfied	21
1	i checked multiple sites and manufacturers for this type of product we are totally pleased with what we received the construction and fabric are all that we could have wanted at much more cost	21
1	we ordered the umbrella to replace one that we had for many years when the product arrived we were surprised at the quality of the product for such a small price we are very satisfied	21
1	i purchased two of the 9 foot oxford garden market umbrellas in desperation we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out when they arrived a short time later i was very pleased to see how well made they were i especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas not only are these umbrellas attractive they are easy to use study and detail oriented i 'll probably get one more before the end of summer	21
1	it 's funny how the guys coming to the bbq all comment and check out this grill	21
1	just received one for a housewarming gift have used it twice and am sure it 's a sleeping giant what a great bbq ! ! ! a little messier than a gas grill and takes maybe 20 mins for coals to be white hot start to finish but what gas grill will get the temperature up to 700 deg ! \? \? talk about the ultimate in broiling ! super easy to light push button ignites w propane in 3 5 mins then wait 15 20 mins and go everyone 's going to want one of these ! !	21
1	got this on ebay for 150 00 it was barely used give me a high five	21
1	while the 04' model of the performer is slightly pricier than the latest 05' model there is no comparision between the two models in terms of design function and useability if you want the best charcoal grill made your choice should be an 04' performer ! ! !	21
1	this is the most awesome wonderful fantastic grill there is out there everyone knows charcol ca n't be beat for flavor but it 's a bummer to get started weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill it is super easy to start the coals easy to keep clean and looking fabulous easy to empty the ashes and easy move around the deck \( out of our frequent seattle rain \) and of course the food we grill comes out delectable i am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method a snap with this grill ! it is well worth the price we love it ! !	21
1	have had this grill for 8 or 9 years unbelievable great product have a 2nd house on miss river used almost year round atleast twice a week have never had a problem highly recommend if like charcoal opposed to gas	21
1	\( husband writing review \) i use my lodge sportsman as often as possible but sometimes it still has to go into storage for a while this is a rugged cover that is custom fit and i appreciate how much cleaner my grill is when i pull it out keeps the dust and cobwebs to a minimum keeps the rain out if you forget and leave it outside it 's well worth it if you 're going to invest in the grill	21
1	the grill wizard grill cleaning brush does the job of cleaning the grill better than any brush i 've ever used very little muscle is required to clean the grill especially if you clean after you cook and when the grill is still warm	21
1	america 's test kitchen rated it number one so i decided to try one for myself i have owned grill brushes from home depot online catalog sellers etceteras the bristles regardless of material on these brushes end up shedding over time or if not they crush down and become nearly worthless the grill wizard eliminates these problems by using a replaceable pad the pad works great i'm still on my first pad and have used it probably 10 times or more already it 's a good product and i highly recommend it	21
1	traditional grill brushes quickly clog with grill funk and the wires bend thus rendering them useless in a short time this has a pad that fits any grill and they can be removed and washed \( or replaced \) rated number one grill brush according to america 's test kitchen	21
1	i got this grill last year as a father 's day gift i 'd never smoked any meat in my life but have been a grill man for a looong time this smoker makes it easy i 've done ribs brisquet pork steaks chicken all turned out great that brisquet especially ! make sure you cure the inside of the grill before cooking anything in it there are instructions in the box also if your model does n't come with the built in thermometer make sure you order one from the char broil website using a standard oven thermometer wastes time and precious heat	21
1	this product works very well and it also has good range mine is about 20ft away from my recieve and it works fine through walls	21
1	do n't be fooled by pictures but this set is huge nicely heavy and a bargain for the price	21
1	i bought this grill set for my fiance he absolutely loved them they are heavy and extremely sturdy i would definitely recommend them !	21
1	i bought this for my bf for a christmas gift he likes to bbq on a little propane grill i guess i should have read the measurements of the tools they are more suited for a huge grill but its better than them being tiny good quality build might want to buy a nicer package to put them in if giving as a gift	21
1	in this part of the world weather forecasts are either scarce or highly inaccurate so far this product has worked great its forecasts are quite accurate so you can plan on taking an umbrella with you in the car if it predicts rain or if you need to wear your bermudas to enjoy the sunshine i had an indoor outdoor thermometer manufactured by radio shack and this unit can actually read that outdoor sensor so the addition of the two sensors that come with this unit allowed me to know the temperature indoors and in my patio garage and the kid 's bedrooms	21
1	i bought this unit 4 years ago it has performed flawlessly i'm still amazed at how often the rain prediction turns out to be correct it 's hitting about 90 accuracy on rain within 36 hours better than the weather dude on television	21
1	my husband loved the size quality and heavy weight of this product great for the male chef in the family	21
1	very stylish looking chaise no assembly required not unlike crate and barrel atrium but at a fraction of the price and maybe not as sturdy made of fixed but flexible metal slats like ikea wood slatted base matresses cushions are needed to use this piece of furniture i was hopping not always i bought also a couple of deep seating chairs \( read review \) the deep seating sofa 2 ottomans and a couple of side tables	21
1	worked as designed and veggies fish small stuff cooked nicely basted easily etc a little large hard to close the weber grill with the handle sticking out and it 's important to keep the grill closed a bit hard to clean too but that 's just how these things are this is one of several similar units that will give good service davi	21
1	this thing catches mosquitos ! it 's easy to set up and you dont have to buy propane it was a lot less expensive than the mosquito magnet and it does what they say it does	21
1	i had one of these when they first came out and loved it this one is even better i would say it 's a must have for someone that has trouble getting a steak medium rare since purchasing this item i once again have the perfect steak i am so glad i found this fork again i am one happy person	21
1	very well made product i am extremely pleased heck of a lot better than that cheap cover i got from ebay last year that was very deceptively advertised regarding it 's durability	21
1	i 've used a lot of grill covers in my time this is the best looks like it will outlast the last few i 've tried that just could n't make it through a year in the hot arkansas sun ! colors are neutral though green is more of an olive but i did n't buy it for the color bought it for the durability course 6 months a trial does not make	21
1	great product durable and quality stitching worth its price to protect your grill	21
1	highly recommed this grill cover the appearance style is classy with it 's subtle colors that work well on the backyard patio and it is sooo durable ! i'm sure it will last for years no more ugly black vinyl covers that you punch holes in the first time you try to drape them over the grill i 'll never use anything else besides this artisan grill cover now ! !	21
1	the off color did n't bother me i expected that after reading all the reviews i agree it could have been about 6 lower to the ground however there was a 3 flaw in the stitching of one seam a bead of duco cement sealed that up and it will never be seen on the back side of the grill the heavy duty material looks like it stand the test of time and weather	21
1	this is the best grill cover i have ever seen it is undamaged by most objects including hail \( which my previous one was not ! \) it goes on easy and removes easy yet stays in place as it should	21
1	this new line of grills is everything you could ask of in a grill high btu output large cooking surface and good looking i was able to maintain constant temperatures with no problem at all i am very happy with this descision	21
1	it works as it should but it does n't have a celsius option otherwise i'm satisfied with it	21
1	i placed the ws 8249u atomic clock that i bought couple months ago next to this one and they both showed different indoor temperature and humidity this one displayed lower humidity \( 47 vs 51 \) and higher indoor temperature \( 80 4 vs 78 9 \) than the ws 8249u i have no idea which one is more accurate the out door temperature was displayed the same because they both received the same signal from the transmitter of the ws 8249u the ws 8256u is smaller than i thought it was i prefer the ws 8249u to the ws 8256u because it has nicer and larger display	21
1	we received this as a christmas gift and have come to dependon it daily for time and weather it displays accurate time temperature and weather tendency using rising or fallingpressure it does not display actual pressure numbers onlyindicating rising or falling pressure outside temp and pressure info is transmitted wirelessly from a small unit mounted outside and has a range of about 200 feet quality of the unit is good and i would recommend to anyone wanting to have an accurate time standard to which all clocks and watches could be set	21
1	i 've used my smoker for 7 years now and i have nothing but great things to say about it one recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer \( about 7 \) for accurate monitoring of the smoking you 'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels it also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat after 7 years the heating element broke and new ones are 40 through char broil i'm appalled that they 're so much and am contemplating buying another smoker instead	21
1	keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until i invested in a heavy duty 25 foot extension cord i bought a 12 gage 15 amp 25 foot chord and i'm now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature i got this cord at lowes and it cost around 18 dollars the manual says to use a 50 foot or less cord with your smoker but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can also thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out got to go my ribs are almost done	21
1	i 've worn out my previous two char broil electric smokers i use the out of them especially for smoking salmon	21
1	i recently purchased a weber gold series grill and wanted quality grilling tools that complimented the stainless steel design of the grill i decided on this spatula because of the quality normally associated with the weber name and i was not disappointed the spatula handle is attractive and has a rubber grip for comfort the length of the spatula is great for reaching the back of the grill and for large flanks of fish i would highly recommend this spatula for anyone who is searching for a quality accessory to their weber grill !	21
1	i just got this turner and it feels really nice in my hand the grip feels very comfortable and the turner has a very nice solid and balanced feel i got this turner so it would work better with the cast iron griddle i got i tried out tonite cooking burgers and it felt easier to flip the patties than a normal cheap spatula i felt like a short order cook !	21
1	the flowtron bug zapper is a great product but bulbs do wear out the cost of the bulbs are not cheap but the destruction of bugs by this unit is very good i use this unit 9 months of the year	21
1	i think this a great product first one lasted over a year and it runs 24 7 even in the winter	21
1	here 's what i like about them 1 they 're metal i ca n't tell you how many times i 've broken those cheap plastic ones when i was trying to put them into the ground2 led lights they have a nice white glow to them instead of the crappy yellowish glow that normal bulbs put off3 the packaging everything they use for packaging is recyclable \( cardboard plastic bags that are clearly marked with the recycle logo info	21
1	i am extremely happy with this perfect accent lights for my front planter i will definitely buy another set for the side planter price was right but shipping costs a little too high well packaged on delivery	21
1	i bought this grill for my husband as a christamas gift he said that it is awesome he says you can walk away and not worry about anything burning also he says that it heats the food evenly the warming rack is a great asset too finally what he likes most is that you can control the temperature for each side wow what a awesome product	21
1	i bought my genisis silver a six years ago despite some abuse by me \( not covering it when it is raining ignoring grease fires while watching tv not cleaning it regularly not replacing the flavorizer bars \) it still is going strong and continues to produces the most delicious burgers steaks and grilled chicken ever i'm really glad i invested in the weber and not in a cheaper brand the size for me is perfect you can fit a lot of meat on this grill	21
1	this grill works great and really survives the elements it looks brand new even after a stormy winter on our chicago balcony i highly recommend it for smaller places because the shelves fold down and out of the way when not in use	21
1	this is one fantastic grill it is easy to ignite and heats up faster than death valley in july cleaning is easy with removable parts for maximum effect i suggest some type of grill cleaner to dissolve the carbonized left overs that will make your bbq look like new there 's some assembly required which took us about twice as long as the directions say it should but once you taste your steaks and burgers you will never be sorry you made the purchase	21
1	wonderful grill everything we expected shipping a problem showed up a week late sat at home for three different delivery dates before the shipper finally showed up grill was slightly damaged we elected to keep it rather than start the shipping hassles over again not sure the money we saved buying through amazon was worth it	21
1	i was impressed looking at this grill at home depot and was even more impressed at the price on amazon com in using the grill i discovered that the weber is truly better than what i have been used to in the past the food actually tastes better ! the assembly took a little longer than the 30 minutes given in the instruction sheet i had a little difficulty in interpreting the pictures and i feel that some written instructions would have been beneficial	21
1	i'm happy with my grill putting it together was n't that hard it took me under an hour also but one thing to note is that when putting on the right bar with the container make sure the container is placed properly before you completely jam in the bar or else it will be very difficult to remove the bar and properly place the container the grilling was great flames were consistent cleaning is a pain though but i think thats a pain for all grills	21
1	i put in two aa batteries went to sleep and the next morning woke up to find the time moon phase date and temp set and accurate very cool product i hang it on a wall about 8 feet up and have no problem seeing the display from 20' away and from an angle of 45 50 degrees it is not completely viewable from the sides but there is no annoying ticking and it beats my 10 ikea analog clock hands down good for a small apartment	21
1	this sofa is a complete bargain it 's stylish in design and comfortable the cushion is firm and supportive the colour and texture of the all weather wicker is fantastic it 's strong standing up to our kids yet light and easy to move around it arrived very promptly and i'm delighted	21
1	purchased this cover to protect my new weber q300 grill fits like a glove ! strong durable construction and superior protection	21
1	this is a very nice cover it is heavy duty and vented at the rear of the top others say this cover fits tight and it does but i can get it on and off by myself the trick is since the cover is a little stiff you can hold it with one hand above the grill while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill then it slides down and fits properly it looks awesome really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' unkept grills ! \)	21
1	do yourself a favor and give yourself this gift a beautiful cover for a great grill this is absolutely the nicest grill cover i 've ever seen and i 've paid 3 times this for flimsy ones i do n't agree that it is too snug it slipped right over with no tugging looks very neat and tailored but i do n't like the big billowy ones anyway excellent deal prompt shipping	21
1	well i like the cover but i it is hard to put on i hoped that it would slip over the grill easily it does not it is a tight fit the quality of the cover is excellent i just wish they made it a little larger so that it would go over the grill easier	21
1	on my porch in my backyard there used to be tons of annoying insects flying around because we live very near to a pond and we have woods ever since i got this terrific product i have been bug free for almost 3 months now ! i can go back to having bar b ques again ! this is the most amazing product ever created	21
1	basic smoker but an outstanding value for the price arrived before expected well packed easy assembly smokes efficiently although the temperature gauge never goes to ideal i'm very pleased with this product	21
1	the weber grill cover was easy to use i would recommend this grill cover for anyone wanting to protect their weber grill it fits the grill very well and is easy to clean	21
1	when you buy a weber you want to protect it and the weber premium grill cover is a wonderful way to do just that it fits like a glove and is very durable	21
1	you ca n't beat it when all you do is unwrap it and use it ! the cover is a high quality perfect fit product \( odd shape and all \) that looks great and fully protects the grill i highly recommend it gt	21
1	what is great about the salad greens seed kit is the aerogarden the instructions make everything very easy and it has been such a pleasure to watch the tiny seedlings pop up watching the greens leaf out waiting for them to grow large enough to start harvesting was such a pleasure and then to snip off leaves right in the kitchen to toss into our salad bowls was a real treat and healthy ! we are now watching baby herbs sprout !	21
1	this product was an exact replacement for the original grates they are great however if i had to do it again and i could find one i might have gone for an upgraded quality grate	21
1	exactly the same as the original grates that came with the bbq arrived fast and packed well	21
1	amazon service and weber quality my grill is up for another 15 years of great grilling	21
1	i thought these grates were n't good enough to sears meat boy was i wrong the beautiful lines on the meats got me great reviews from my guests easy to clean too	21
1	this umbrella 's quality belies its bargain price it assembled easily and opens closes smoothly the construction seems sturdy and the fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out of the shipping crate my only complaint and it 's almost trivial is the resin finial faded rather quickly in the sunlight i'm overall quite pleased with the product and i'm looking for places in my yard to utilize more of these	21
1	very stylish i bought two one for the office and one for home no problems with either of them but i have not checked to see how accurate they are	21
1	great price on this unit saw the same one locally for 159 00 and not the color wood i needed followed directions and works great the package was new and item was as advertised nib amazon must have gotten a buy on this wood color as it is cheaper than same units withdifferent wood	21
1	we replaced an old larger and broken sunbeam bug snapper with this unit this is lighter and easier to handle we 're in southern arizona so our bug season is just starting the unit works great but upon encountering a really big moth it sizzles for as long as ten seconds kind of gruesome if you 're dealing with night flying insects this is the solution	21
1	i would recommend this product over to others no complaints	21
1	i bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews it did the job i bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time i saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual	21
1	i have used flowtron products for years this year coud n't find one locally and purchased another brand ! lated one month andhad to replace the bulb the new bulb lasted less than a month total cost was twice that of a flowtron bk 40 the flowtron bk 40 will last one year 24 7 year around like a car weatherand age takes it 's toll but you 'll need to clean the deadcritters off every other week finally found a flowtron onamazon thanks no critters around my house big or small	21
1	my husband and i recently moved to a very rual area between two national forest in nca and were being eaten alive by bugs of all kinds we purchased two of these units and it has made a significant reduction in the bug problem for us we would suggest this to anyone who has a bug problem and enjoys the outdoors	21
1	this is my second bug zapper took another brand back that did n't work this zapper is working great and that 's all thanks to its intelligent design some bug zappers have super small entry holes and then wimpy little electrodes inside this zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs this zapper works really well in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out we live in an urban area near a plant nursery so we 'd always have bugs coming in the back door now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor great product	21
1	this thing works great i prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so i never had a chance to make beer can chicken the chicken i cooked came out perfect crispy skin and juicy inside excellent ! i'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time the bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean highly recommended	21
1	this product is great for the following reasons 1 stability \( your chicken wo n't fall over during the cooking process as with just a standard can \) 2 quality is wonderful \( not flimsy and cheap \) 3 dishwasher safe \( easy to clean \) 4 not too big \( so that it takes up the whole grill \) 5 priced well compared to other similiar products6 no worries where the can has been and what inks might come of	21
1	this is an awesome grill for tailgating it 's easy to pack up and cooks great	21
1	to the reviewers who report that the grille does n't get hot enough the slightest breeze blows the flame out and you should need to stock up on extra gas cannisters i would point out this review is for the charcoal model ! ! once the coals are fully going on mine nothing short of hurricane katrina could blow them out and with the proper amount of charcoal loaded in you have all the heat you 'll ever need i have nothing but praise for mine nice going weber	21
1	set up easily stores easily transports easily for grilled meals for two skewered food sausages steaks burgers fish corn on the cob it has grilled more efficiently for us than our big bbq the folding legs keep the direct heat off any surface underneath with this efficient little griller we 're enjoying patio cook outs much more frequently than before	21
1	this grill is the greatest for simplicity and ease of use it is compact and portable so there is no unsightly grill always hanging around your house or patio i use it in summer and winter and even set it up in the snow if you do charcoal grilling exclusively as i do this grill has the flexibility to adjust the combustion air and exhaust to suite what you are cooking for high temperatures such as for steaks i leave the top cover off takes perhaps 5 to 6 grillings before one learns all the right charcoal loadings and vent adjustments necessary cools off totally in 15 minutes if you close all vents	21
1	we purchased a new go anywhere charcoal grill to replace one exactly like it that has lasted 15 years with usage 3 4 times weekly the absolute best choice for perfection barbequing	21
1	we are pleased with our recent purchase we were surprised that it came through the us mail service it did have a broken part that we believe is used on the cord to open the umbrella	21
1	it is a great umbrella very straight forward to put together and easy to use	21
1	the umbrella i ordered is fine just what i had hoped it would be however i subsequently ordered an umbrella stand \( after you prompted me to do so \) and when it arrived the two tightening screws in the shaft had been damaged in shipment each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off as a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin i have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store any suggestions	21
1	the umbrella was quite a score through amazon including the shipping handling it was still cheaper than walmart ! lol additionally it is of great quality we utilize this umbrella for our bistro table and our porch now is all green it is sturdy and even withstood being blow over with tropical storm tammy ! twice	21
1	these are very handsome umbrellas that appear sturdy and well constructed i like the mechanism for raising and lowering the umbrella very low tech and smart my one issue with them is really not their fault but my own inexperience in what to look for they are totally stationary and do n't have a tilting feature that might be standard i just do n't know but i would have wanted that flexibility oh and the wood is nicely stained and the brass fittings are rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible and they 're simple to put together and take apart great price and they block the sun and look terrific	21
1	had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms \? try this one ! very nice design looks great simulated wood finish pole easy open and close we are very satisfied	21
1	i checked multiple sites and manufacturers for this type of product we are totally pleased with what we received the construction and fabric are all that we could have wanted at much more cost	21
1	we ordered the umbrella to replace one that we had for many years when the product arrived we were surprised at the quality of the product for such a small price we are very satisfied	21
1	i purchased two of the 9 foot oxford garden market umbrellas in desperation we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out when they arrived a short time later i was very pleased to see how well made they were i especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas not only are these umbrellas attractive they are easy to use study and detail oriented i 'll probably get one more before the end of summer	21
1	my 15 year old son put the grill together while i was as work the grill has a very even heat distribution and very good heating controls i have cooked steak at high temperatures and chicken at low temperatures all items have come out great so far the stainless steel cooking surfaces and internal parts appear like they will last along time my last weber grill lasted for about 12 years i expect that this one will do as well or better my only disappointment was that this grill did not come configured for quick connects like the last grill did it uses the standard screw type connection for the gas bottle	21
1	i did buy this grill in a store and now that i search amazon for acessories i find that it is a lot cheaper here it is a good grill the way it works but the quality is lacking many parts are not as sturdy corrosion resistant or easy enough to clean as i would expect	21
1	i love it ! it 's a bit of work to maintain but it 's an awesome grill that cooks everything \( once i figured out how to cook and got a good grill cook book \) i bought two propane cylinders and just swap them out when the gauge that they hang on says it 's a at a quarter tank it 's worth the price	21
1	i have been through atleast 3 grills prior to this one i was the type of person that would buy the 200 job from sears or something and figure i 'll get about five years out of this one never did 2 3 seasons tops this grills you know will last solid stainless steel warranties that are more than a couple of months its built to last and gaurenteed to last aleast five years it will be worth every penny you spend	21
1	i owned a weber for almost 20 years before weather began to takes its toll this one is works just like the last one and i hope to get a least that much wear as it is stainless and my last one was not	21
1	a fully cooked fall apart pork butt in less that 2 hours you 'll think you died and went to heaven easy assembly easy clean up put a whole chicken on and you will never fry chicken again ever	21
1	i 've had much fun using the rotisserie and my first attempts a turkey and a pork roast were quite good ! i anticipate excellent results as i gain experience one caveat it does n't make sense to buy this unless you plan to cook 10 15 lb roasts the instruction booklet does n't provide much in the way of cooking guidance or recipes but there 's lots of both on the internet i suspect that using a rotisserie is easier w a gas grill but i 've been using charcoal for many many years and that 's that	21
1	wood chips and this rotisserie you are missing one of the great pleasures in life well made and built to last years	21
1	the ring and motor do what they are supposed to do the ring did not fit very well at first it was able to rock back and forth however after a little bending into shape it fit more snug the way the ring rests on the kettle there will alway be some gap which does not allow for a good seal i not only use this as a rotisserie but also to give me more room for beer can chicken its worth getting it for the added flexibility	21
1	my wife bought me this for me a couple years ago i think she had an ulterior motive for me to make the thanksgiving turkey when all of her family came to visit i did and it was simply outstanding ! i have done several turkeys chickens and roasts on this rotisserie and they all turned out perfect with very little effort if you have a 22 5 inch weber kettle you need this rotisserie	21
1	this is by far the best grill accessory i have every gotten it cooks chickens to perfection and keeps them juicy moist and tender i have n't tried cooking anything else but i'm sure whatever it was it would come out great i would definitely suggest this to anyone who has a weber charcoal grill	21
1	i bought this after calling weber to find out if it would actually fit my summit gold c4 it does and that is what mattered to me i ca n't comment on durability as i just got it but it does feel heavy enough to withstand a beating	21
1	this cover is extremely heavy duty and has survived many windy thunderstorms and still good as new after a year and a half it is still going strong still good as new	21
1	bought a nice grill wanted needed a cover works well a bit ackward but does the job	21
1	exactly what i was looking for very heavy duty and the fit was perfect	21
1	this pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels the squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes i would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound i ca n't hear this noise in the attic so i will buy another when this wears out	21
1	plain and simple very effective i plugged this device in to the wall in my office in a school within seconds the roaches in our kitchen area ran into the hallway they have not been seen since there have not been any mouse droppings around either	21
1	the item arrived about three weeks after it was ordered one of the pieces was damaged in shipment i called the customer support line a replacement part was shipped out to me at no charge the broken piece was to be discarded constuction was easy and quick \( 1 hour \)	21
1	this cover works very nicely with my grill it fits well and appears to be fairly good grade material i have no complaints	21
1	protecting your grill is important if you leave it outside all the time this is by far the best grill cover we have had it is easy to put over the grill the velcro straps keep it from flying off it fits the genesis s 320 perfectly and it is heavyweight recommended definitely	21
1	this hammock is made of soft cotton string it is extra large and very strong you need 13 foot span to hang it taunt which gives you enough room for the whole famil	21
1	i have looked at a couple different hammocks and for the money this was the most comfotable out of all because of the soft cotton design definetly worth the money i would only suggest selling with or buying a frame for it	21
1	i purchased this smoker last summer the assembly was simple one piece of hardware was missing but had no trouble replacing the nut that holds the thermometer in place i replaced the factory regulator with an adjustable unit and can get any level of heat i desire it is sensitive to wind though	21
1	love it ! ! ! projection of time in soft red light in numbers that are easily read without glasses extremely non invasive light especially enjoy feature of two separate alarms very accurate temperature readings of both indoor and outside temperatures well worth the money ! ! !	21
1	i bought the clock for my wife it arived on time like they said it was in great shape it works great the projection part does just what it says and yes it is dim when it is daylight or the light is on but i dont know of any that is not like that its nice to wake up at night or in the morn to look up and see what the temp is outside we would buy from amazon again	21
1	this sonic pest repeller works a lot better than others it will keep away a lot of rodents and decrease the number of spiders drastically you will start to see less and less spider webs and it does not make a whole lot of noise i would define tally recommend this over other sonic pest repellers and is well worth the money for how much of a decrease in insects and creatures	21
1	cover fit easily over grill no problems plus it was cheaper than name brand	21
1	the only complaint i have with my gas smoker is that it was damaged when delivered \( this was also the case of a friend of mine who ordered the same smoker \) it was dented in several places i have cooked as many as 12 whole chickens at on time and they all came out fully cooked and juicey it 's a great way to cook just put your meat on adjust your heat then set back and visit with your guest while the smoker does all the work after people have tasted my smoked faire they always ask where i got my smoker several of my friends have bought this smoker for their own use	21
1	this smoker works like a charm ! the only regret i have is that it is a bit larger than i expected i should have bought the next size down other than that the times i have used it the results were great temperature is easy to control and that was the main concern as i wanted sometime i did n't have to babysit while i was smoking my ribs or pork shoulder others have complained about receiving the units damaged i guess i was lucky there was a slight crease in one corner but i was able to straighten it out easily better packaging would be an improvement my 02 is that it is well worth the investment	21
1	the great outdoors deluxe smoker is exactly what i was looking for the lp gas is great for easy temperature control all i need to do while smoking is periodically check the level of liquid in the pan \( and add more wood chunks if desired \) the temomitor is easy to read and appears to be made of good quality the only complaint i have is the smoker is not foam protected inside the cardboard box when shipped thus my smoker had two minor dents in the corner of the smoker they do not affect the operation at all	21
1	down here in southern mississippi you can sit inside with the ac in summer or hang a hammock in the shade but this is my best one ever and probably my last one since it 's so lightweight i prefer to carry it in out of the weather even though it 's so durable i 've had several rope hammocks to replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot be beat the grandbaby loves it	21
1	the hammock is a great choice if you like sharing it with you significant other or by yourself it 's very sturdy and comfortable even with two adults the quality of hammock is good and worth the price especially compared to other models we looked at	21
1	i got this hammock back in november so i do n't know if this hammock will be good for summer but it is the perfect hammock for winter ! my fiance and i could nap in it all afternoon with a couple of pillows and a blanket in the middle of winter it is very comfortable even with 2 people on it the surface seems to be semi water resistance we left it out in the rain a few times and most of the water stay on top of the surface we just turn the hammock dump out the water and it dried under the sun in a few hours i read somewhere that the green stripes will fade over time but i can live with it	21
1	this is a very neat hammock it is very comfortable and easy to get in and out of it does of course not allow air to flow through like a rope hammock but is so much more comfortable i also bought the matching pillow and really enjoy the lazy summer evenings now i roll mine up and bring it inside when i'm not using it which is quick and easy to do and will make it last that much longer it will hold to adults but is a little crowded	21
1	i use my hammock about 75 of the year and find it extremely comfortable it was bit expensive but i guess in the long run it will be worth it i have had mesh hammocks that only last one season i think this one is going to last for years	21
1	this bbq tool set is absolutely the top of the line and worth much more than i paid for it ! all the tools are heavy wood with rubber grips and heavy stainless steel even the case is made to hold up for a long time i was truly impressed when i received it	21
1	this is an awesome set ! ! my husband and i use it all the time it looks great and can really take a beating	21
1	my husband was very pleased with this set it is the best one yet the handles are great to grip and the set is easy to use they wash clean easily this is a great product i would recommend it to anyone who loves to grill	21
1	i'm new to the world of smoking and ordered this for when i dont feel like doing the whole charcoal thing it works fairly well and the flavor is great but not quite as much as you get from using a charcoal grill i think it was designed to be placed on either side of the grill i 've opted to slide the grates to the sides and place the smoker in the middle it seems that less smoke escapes the grill this way a worthwhile purchase	21
1	if you buy all three of these items individually from amazon com they cost 11 50 less than buying them in this set ! other than that i highly recomend these i grill several times a week and these have been put to good use with no complaints	21
1	the oxo line of cooking supplies is always a sure bet if you want to look stylin' while you are out bbq'in this is a utensil set that wo n't let you down the stainless steel was strong and sturdy it cut right through a whole chicken and held it sturdy so i could transfer it from the bbq to the plate great set i highly reccommend	21
1	i always recommend the oxo line of tools to anyone that does a lot of cooking and wants something really designed for use this is especially true for anyone with problems such as tendonitis arthritis or carpal tunnel these tools are all designed to leverage energy efficiently instead of wasting energy as most poorly designed utensils try them out	21
1	i bought this pillow because i just got a new hammock for my backyard and i felt it needed one what else can i say for a hammock pillow \? soft smooth fabric prefect for those weekend afternoon quot cat naps quot	21
1	this is a product i was not sure about just from seeing the picture once it arrived i was very pleased with my choice the picture does n't do it justice it is very sturdy and the rubber grip helps too ! ! ! great gift for a man or woman that loves to grill	21
1	it 's designed in germany and mfgd in china i 'd say definitely locate and purchase the extension kit i did i have a large guatemalan hammock that i 've owned for years that 's barely seen any use usually on camping trips it finally occured to me to research and secure a hammock stand and it 's really delightful to be able to laze in the hammock in the shade of the house on summer afternoons i wish i 'd bought one of these years ago	21
1	after assembling the stand i was very pleased with my decision to purchase this one i also ordered an extension thinking that for my mayan family hammock i would need to make it longer but to my surprise the hammock fit perfectly without the extension and because the height of the stand can be adjusted pretty high you could put a longer hammock in it because of this very heavy steel well enameled excellent workmanship and very easy to assemble definitely a five star purchase	21
1	i definitely need one in each room we have one in each of the two bedrooms the living room and the kitchen the only room i still see roaches in is the bathroom i guess i should get one for that room as well we definitely used to see big i'm gonna eat your baby roaches and i have n't seen one since we put these in however we were just moving in and had been ripping cabinets and flooring out so they may have only surfaced due to our mild construction which happened to end right about the time i put these in final verdict \? eh circumstantial evidence says they seem to work	21
1	in using this product i actually did find a mouse later in the kitchen caught by a trap this product should be used in coordination with other devices to kill rodents and not depend on it alone	21
1	i recently moved into a house and was seeing spiders and centipedes on a regular basis so i decided to buy these to see if i could get rid of them i 've been using these for about 3 weeks in various rooms of the house and have n't seen a bug since i have to say that they really seem to be doing what they 're supposed to i have used similar products like this in the past \( not from black and decker \) and have also found them to work so i believe that this technology actually works well for getting rid of pests	21
1	i received this just a couple of days ago and it works awesome ! ! i grilled bite size veggies in this and nothing fell through the holes i still had the grilled taste but no messy cleanup or a hot kitchen excellent product !	21
1	product is a must for bbq buffs have nothing but good things to say re amazon merchants	21
1	this cushion is extra long and extra thick and should work with most any chaise lounge it has really firm support not one of those puffy things that go flat in one season i highly recommend it	21
1	this was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall i was very familiar with this clock since i had the original one for almost 3 years i like the look of this clock and i like the choices you have for different displays overall this is a sweet clock i did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and program this clock it wo n't do what you want it to do not sure if it how the owners manual is written or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features	21
1	i love this clock i won it as an incentive through my creative memories sales i love that it is always set to the accurate time my 4 and 6 year old love to tell me what time it is and at what phase of the moon it is presently \( they always double check outside \) it 's been a great addition to our home	21
1	i needed enclosed storage for all of my supplies and feed that i use with my goats this unit does everything that i need with room to spare	21
1	i bought this for my boyfriend for christmas and he was able to set it up right away it was easy to set up and it is easy to use	21
1	i have 2 indoor stations in different rooms in my house operating from just 1 outdoor sensor about 60 feet from my house and they work very well and the tempt they show is always the same as my mercury thermometer which is always right on robert johnson lewistown p	21
1	this is a very heavy duty cleaning brush i used it all last season and it is still in great shape	21
1	like all cast iron cookware not preseasoned preseasoning is an absolute must i use this product with the bayou classic single burner it makes awsome eggs bacon and grilled cheese whatever with lots of space for cooking a bunch at once great for camps or just in the backyard for fun	21
1	i ordered two orders which equals four chairs the boxes are thick and double boxed the chairs are placed one inside the other all wrapped with paper around the legs arms and on top of the back fairly light weight and solid frame nothing to put together the color is a low luster pretty taupe color with tiny specks of silver very expensive looking the cushions are a golden taupe color with an expensive weave pattern and piping around the edges top and bottom for structure it feels durable and water proof the back corners have velcro straps to hold the cushions in place they can be neatly stacked i'm extremely pleased with this order thank you amazon	21
1	was very happy when i opened the box better than in picture but not a perfect match for the table i got from amazon even if it 's the same brand and almost perfect matching style but they still go together nice bottom line the chairs are great	21
1	i ordered this clock for my dad and he loves it it is so easy to see the time on the ceiling and it keeps the correct time automatically the indoor temp is a nice addition and the price is right	21
1	i love this clock it does n't take up too much space on the nightstand and it is religiously accurate	21
1	if you have a problem seeing the time on your watch at night then this is the answer the time projected on to the ceiling is great also the alarm is unique as it starts slowly and then it starts to accelerate until you turn it off	21
1	buy this little fun toy clock it 's a blast in the bedroom just look up and you know the time i love it ! cute little thing the front panel is worthless \( to see \) but who needs it	21
1	love to look up at the clock in the night without having to roll around to see a clock works great ! !	21
1	if you are the type that wakes up during the night and has to know the time this is the clock for you i absolutely love it no glasses necessary and i do n't have to crane my neck to find the time if you 're a fanatic about exact time \( i'm not \) the atomic feature means you 're always on schedule i like this clock so much that i will be purchasing several as extra christmas gifts its a great fun item too	21
1	i bought one for my girlfriend over a few years ago it sets itself and projects the time on the ceiling in a soft red this is an amazing feature no more getting up or turning your head to check the time it makes the sleep experience much more comfortable	21
1	this griddle is very useful especially if you bring your grill to the camp site the surface cooks evenly and if sufficiently heated does a good job at first i thought it was solid cast iron but upon further inspection found that it has some kind of high temperature coating my only criticism is that it is n't a more non stick surface and food can be hard to clean off after use the gee whiz factor is great when you whip it out around other people who have the little stamped metal travel grills this item really rounds out the baby q 's options	21
1	i'm used to using a teflon coated electric griddle that has much more space than the baby q griddle cooking eggs and pancakes on the cast iron proved challenging and everything cooked much faster \( too fast at first \) the lack of a drain hole made cooking the bacon very greasy it got to the point where i had to remove the bacon remove the griddle dump the grease and continue cooking on the plus side the griddle fits perfectly and the included chrome handles make removing the griddle safe and effortless	21
1	just got to use the weber baby q griddle it worked great the only complaint i have is that it could be bigger it covers just a little over half of the available grill area more would be better other than that the design is excellent and it works great	21
1	two days after buying this swing i found just the exact thing i was looking for and contacted don the seller about a refund even though it was a sunday he got right back to me and said he 'd make every effort to cancel the order even though it ships direct from his supplier he kept me informed every step of the way while he did what he could to cancel by tuesday i got word that the order had been cancelled and that a full refund had been given it was such a stress free exchange i would recommend this buyer for sure	21
1	my wife and kids love the chair but i do n't care for it that much i thought the chair was a little bit constricting assembly was easy give yourself alot of room for it the base is huge	21
1	this patio table was quite a bargain ! it arrived in good shape was incredibly easy to assemble and was a perfect match for the astonica chairs i had purchased the month before a definite value for the money	21
1	if you are looking for this to be very accurate then you need to use the lithium batteries because of the cold temps here the cheaper batteries do not work as well maybe where it does n't get in the minus temps the rayovac batteries will be okay but not here in ne the sensor needs to be put in a location that is out of the sun and out of reach of your pets and children which makes for a little decision making time on your part	21
1	i received one with my la crosse weather station and placed it on the east side of my dwelling it provides a true reading unlike others i 've used in the past i plan on adding 1 or 2 more sensors for an even better reading	21
1	i ordered this sensor to go with a very old la crosse unit after the old sensor had been dropped i ca n't count how many time we never fixed it to a spot after three years of use and kept droping it off a brick wall three feet high bringing in the groceries etc it is extremely accurate as is the unit and even the forcasts are bang on i highly rate this product	21
1	i love my stack able planter it 's very neat clean and even accommodates my amaryllis bulbs in the center i anticipate no problems bringing my plants indoors this winter either	21
1	the product work perfectly and the displays are very good beaufiful and modern design	21
1	like the other reviewer i have this clock in my office in my case in the middle of a warehouse within 2 minutes the atomic clock had connected and set the time and date it has been in wireless contact ever since \( there is an icon to let you know \) the time numerals are a little over 2 high and very clear easy to read from 50' away the day date and temp displays are about an inch tall and also very clear but since they are so much smaller they do n't have quite the distance visability it is nice to have a clock around that is always right keeps my meetings on time no arguement over whose watch is correct	21
1	we were so excited about getting this fire pit rightly so it 's great we could n't ask for more ! adding wood is a breeze it radiates heat well was very easy to put together so far has n't shown any rust at all \( although we do expect it to eventually \)	21
1	a great outdoor grill however you really need gloves to open it and load wood once hot	21
1	i bought this fireplace a few months ago and have enjoyed many a nice night drinking a martini and watching the fire this fireplace got me motivated to cut down the tree that died in my yard last year half way through burning it ! now for the unit it arrived nicely packed with all parts installation was a snap about 15 minutes there were dents in the screen which is obviously part of the packing process they are so small though that they cannot be seen unless someone is specifically looking for them the removable screens on the side are nice for adding more wood while the fire is still going be sure to use mitts or tongs however or you will get burned	21
1	we got this for my dad for father 's day i was not there for assembly but heard that it went well it is so much nicer looking in person than in the ad pix a very nice little unit dad did say that he might want to drill some holes in the bottom to get a better draft going but all in all we are thrilled with this product	21
1	guys this is a great purchase it 's a quality unit and is bigger than it looks on the package charbroil has done a fabulous job of making such a good little unit for such a good price unless you 're looking for something totally snazzy and are willing to spend a lot of money do n't pass this one up	21
1	i am very pelased with my new umbrella the design is classic and matches well with my exisitng patio furniture the packaging was excellent i had no issue putting it together no assembly was really required it shades my deck well and is weather resistant great buy	21
1	i ordered this on a friday and it was delivered the following weds the base is heavy the colors are very in now a distressed oil rubbed bronze pol and base with a taupe fabric very nice the umbrella opens and closes with a wind up handle it is solid and put together well the fabric is thick and provides good shade on my south southwest facing rear lanai it was very easy to put together i am happy with my purchase of this set a	21
1	we have a small back yard this gazebo is just the right size for us the lighter effect and the 8x8 size does n't over power our garden good quality and easy to follow instructions made it an afternoon project	21
1	never failed on me ! it realy works ! i was not a believer before i tryed it it worked great from the first try ! before that i used a special jelee to start my b b q charcoal i 'll do it never ever again ! this chimney is great	21
1	i really am pleased with my solar lights they are the right color everything they seem to stay light longer	21
1	i ordered 2 chaise and very happy with them they are a little lighter in weight than i expected also the image shows the metal a little lighter than what they are the cushion looks beige in the photo and is actually more grey besides all that they match very well with an ethan allen set that i have delivery was fine and they arrived sooner than expected	21
1	i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges \( 2 \) they would only be temporary until i could afford good ones because they were so inexpensive well these are good and i do n't need to replace them the design actually matches my table set and i did n't even realize it until we unpacked them fully assemled ! i only have one complaint and it 's really not that bad the thickness of the cushion seems fine for me but my skinny butt husband tells me the cushions are n't cushiony enough other than that the chaises are absolutely wonderful and good quality	21
1	everything about this collection is first class the pictures on the site were accurate i was glad i made the purchase it saved me hundreds of dollars compared to the retail mark up from my other distributor of patio furniture i ended up purchasing the whole collection	21
1	this chaise lounge made for the perfect addition to my deck the cushion is durable thick and extremely comfortable with velcro 'ties' to keep the cushion in place \( from sliding \) it truly is a beautiful piece there was a slight mix up with the shipping but once everything was straightened out the lounger was delivered just as scheduled the delivery guys even brought the box around to my backyard and on to my deck the chair comes completely assembled all you do is open the box and enjoy	21
1	these lounge chairs are hands down the best deal that i have found they are extremely comfortable sturdy and attractive ! plus free shipping and they come already assembled which is a big deal for me since i am not very handy ! ! great item and great deal all around	21
1	this chaise lounge really exceeded my expectations i 'd shopped around and did n't want to spend 400 plus for a chaise lounge this is a great price plus you get free shipping they arrive completely assembled and well packaged very attractive sturdy and most importantly very comfortable i highly recommend got the side table with ice bucket and love it as well	21
1	lifetime has produced an extremely well made table it is very sturdy the top seem impervious to abuse the legs are much more robust than any other i have seen and they lock when folded a really nice feature highly recommended	21
1	this card table is very sturdy the legs are solidly locked in place both when extended and when stored the top appears to be durable overall this appears to be a quality product	21
1	i have a high ceiling so the display of the time was fuzzy and i missed the see through case with the red night light on the earlier model but overall i was satisfied with the clock	21
1	i love this clock because it has it all in a slick package for a good price the battery lasts forever so it 's portable the time sets itself atomically it shows the temperature has the obligatory annoying alarm clock the time lights up on the ceiling and it looks good to boot very well made and highly recommended oregon scientific rocks	21
1	automatically sets and updates time day date with u s atomic clock does not work for me in washingotn dc	21
1	i have had an oregon scientific clock for the last 7 years finally had to replace it because of a soda spill i knew i wanted another oregon scientific clock and this was the best choice in fact this one works better then the old one \( no long cord with a humongous antenna \) i love the time on the ceiling feature yes it only works when no sunlight is in the room but i dont sleep during the day i highly recomend this product	21
1	my husband i love this unit since we now know when someone is pulling up the driveway it continues to send us the alert through storms heat and extreme cold	21
1	we placed the receiver in our lower deck as we do n't have a door bell there the sensor we placed at the gate at the top of the stairs when some one opens the gate we can hear it in our spa room it works great and gives a sense of privacy	21
1	this grill cover is much nicer than the weber standard cover i have the 18 1 2 and ca n't imagine that the 22 1 2 is much different what i really like is the elastic pieces sown to the bottom that keep it on snuggly even when a little wind is blowing again it looks nice all black stitching virtually invisible and a nice weber logo after a couple nights left in the rain the grill shows zero signs of being out in the weather	21
1	perfect for what it is meant for ! what more can i say nice looking and works well	21
1	well look no further my apartment complex does n't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed i was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my george forman kettle grill i did n't want to lug it in and out all summer so i took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly ! i can now leave my george forman kettle grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements	21
1	this shelter met all my expectations i would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it being so large it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise i had mine setup on a raised deck so the sandbags were a life saver ! overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents ! the storage bag is outstanding too with nice wheels and a handle it is easy to transport ! the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large	21
1	this is a great little table ! i'm able to stand at the table and cut fabric for a sewing project then adjust the height and the kids can sit at the table and paint or craft i am very pleased with this purchase !	21
1	i just received this table and i can already tell that it will be a great asset for my scrapbooking the table is adjustable in height so no matter where i am scrapbooking i can adjust the height to fit the chair i am sitting in the table is light enough for me to move by myself and will fold up for easy storage the table is also sturdy enough to use paper punches and eyelet setters i'm thinking of purchasing another so i can spread out even more !	21
1	i cannot wait to have a party i purchased both this and the fire pit table both pieces are easy to assemble sturdy and really fun ! my sister is going to be so jealous what are sisters for	21
1	bought this with the sean conway tiverton 2006 deep seating 4 pc chair set looks and feels great as a set it was a chance worth taking	21
1	i agree completely with the other reviewer well packaged easy to put together very sturdy way better quality than those you see at outdoor concept stores i mainly ordered it b c i knew it would be the right size to go w the strathwood chaise lounges i ordered i am very happy with it	21
1	the table arrived within a few days and well packed it was easy to put together took me about 10 minutes one of the best instructions and labeling of parts i have ever seen even a little bottle with paint for touch ups the table is just like described and is of good quality it has a bronze brown finish and looks great with the strathwood deep seating chairs i ordered earlier definetly would buy this again	21
1	different visually striking very comfortable the only pedantic problem is that the hinges do seem to rust which may be a problem later on excellent value go look at crate barrel for comparison	21
1	this item arrived 1 week early i took it out the box and it was already assembled it is so sleek and extremely comfortable it is a great addition to my patio the price was reasonable and it had free shipping you ca n't beat it ! ! i want another one	21
1	this is the second temperature station i have purchsed both work well but differ in small points the instructions might be clearer getting back from using max min iis not easy i have not used the station in below freezing weather so i am curious to see if the batteries will work at 10	21
1	it 's easy to carry every where we g	21
1	i ordered 3 of these aprons for use on the kcbs bbq circuit and would have preferred a slightly heavier fabric however for the price these aprons are great	21
1	put a few racks or ribs and a full chicken in the smoker on the first use and everything came out great with the lp gas it was easy to maintain a pretty steady temperature and the large chip box made great smoke for a long period great barbecue with very little effort	21
1	there are probably more authentic ways to make real bbq but nothing any easier if what you like about bbq is the flavor not the work this unit is for you add water to the pan chips to holder put some dry rubbed pork on one \( or all \) of the four grates light the gas and you are good to go it holds temperature very well unattended adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want your friends will think you are a genius	21
1	i love this smoker ! ! ! talk about easy set up and easy to use if you have never had a smoker this is a great buy smoking is so easy and the flavor you get from it is out of this world	21
1	to keep it from cracking i am using mineral oil on mine and keeping it out of the weather	21
1	when i decided to purchase a weber kettle i knew that a side table was required several reviews have spoken about the table splitting i ordered mine from my local hardware store and when i picked it up i asked about finishing it the hardware folks \( and this is a really good store \) gave me a gloss polyurethane finish and very fine sandpaper to prep my work table bottom line take some time and finish this product your local hardware folks will guide you satisfactorily	21
1	the fabric is very strong and nicer looking than the usual black covers very attractive on the deck	21
1	we had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds we ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly w o special instructions to do so when we received it it was a bit thinner than i wanted but for the price and fast delivery it was great ! ! ! the material is durable and of good quality our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it 's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear like i said it 's a bit thinner than i wanted but a good buy	21
1	they are handsome and nicer than i expected by far the fabric has a really nice quality strong pleasantly textured durable and a fine rich color they 're handsome well stitched and sturdy very comfortable and are holding up to the sun some rain too i must admit these were a terrific deal	21
1	i ordered this to go along with the teak lounge chair and both of them turned out to be a great deal only took one day to arizona and so far no color change from the every day sun	21
1	nice fabric and construction backordered item came 3 weeks before expected fabric color was a little darker than it appeared on the website but that ca n't always be helped	21
1	these are very nice quality and comfortable everything was as expected and came in just a few days	21
1	cushions look great on chaise loungers bright dark green in color cushion get very hot in the sun items arrive well boxed and well before promised date	21
1	great value look fantastic on the chairs excellent price could n't be happier	21
1	nice cushions that dry out pretty fast seem durable they also seem high quality the only thing is they are more of a tan color the picture shows them as white which is what i really wanted but they are nice could use a strap at the top also so the wind does n't constantly blow them over	21
1	i have been using a grill mat for 4 months and i love it i grill fish and chicken on a broilmaster grill and i have only great things to say about the mat i spray a bit of olive oil on after it is warm and then grill my food and it is great ! !	21
1	after reading these other reviews i decided to wait a while to post a review i bought two of these chairs summer 04 and they are doing great relatively easy to put together and really sturdy they are still looking good with no issues with fading or anything my wife would make me get rid of these if there was any issue or problem with them at all i hope she does n't read this	21
1	they are very attractive and we had no trouble putting them together our only complaint the stain ran during a rain storm and stained our patio	21
1	i bought two of these sets along with the table and wow i get so many compliments they are beautiful on my new front porch i was skeptic at first because of the price but they are worth every penny and a few hundred dollars more	21
1	i purchased 2 of these and could n't be more pleased like another reviewer i gave 4 stars only becuase i 've only had them for a few days and do n't know how they 'll weather they arrive mostly assembled and took only about 20 minutes to assemble each set they look great and are a comfy place to spend an afternoon not as huge and heavy as the ones we used to make but they 're solid and much easier to move	21
1	price was right for the grill piece only drawback is no real grill location to use it	21
1	my family and i are quite happy with this hammock it is comfortable and sturdy since it does n't come with the hanging hardware future buyers make sure to order it from amazon at the same time \( hammock kit screws by american science surplus \) otherwise you might find yourself on a long search the only other place where we came across it was wal mart	21
1	got it and love it it does not leave marks you when you get up and it is sooooooo comfortable	21
1	it was more than i expected it was easy to hang looks good and most of all it is as comfortable as advertised too bad i do n't have more places to hang more hammocks	21
1	this clock is great i'm always looking over at the clock through the night now i just look up i recommended this to a friend and she said they love it this will be christmas presents for everyone next year	21
1	after much research and reading lots of reviews we chose this weber it is more expensive than others in its category but the high reviews and our past experience with weber and the warranty helped us make this our choice we love it so far we live on top of a hill and one of our concerns was the wind well the grill performs superbly ! even on a cold \( 40 degrees \) and windy day it heated up in less than 10 mintues	21
1	i got my grill to go advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far the makers of the grill 2 go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill the open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models it is still easy to transport and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my tarheels play basketball a lot of fun i completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non stick cooking surface for the cooking area	21
1	great little digital thermomter as long as you keep it out of direct sunlight i have it in the back of the house pointing west and it only gets minimal sun i have checked it against various banks in town and it is very accurate was just what i wanted and for the price it works great	21
1	we stuck this outside our bedroom window now we can see what the temperature is outside as soon as we get up in the morning no more waiting for the weather to come on the news to figure out what to wear !	21
1	easy to read accurate enough for the girls we date and cheap	21
1	great cover heavy and well made fit 's perfect it did n't come with any bourbon or beer though i was dissappointed	21
1	fits well eventhough i just bought it i think it 's going to sustain the extreme virginia weather for couple of years	21
1	vinyl is vinyl right \? wrong this grill cover has some heft to it the thickness and feel of it are lightyears ahead of the cheap discount store cover that lasted less than one summer now entering its third winter in north dakota and no cracks rips or flaws worth every penny	21
1	finally a grill cover that actually stays on the grill and protects it in the worst weather the velcro straps keep it secure but it is very easy to remove when ready to use the grill this has to be the 4th or 5th grill cover we 've tried and it will be the last one we try i would recommend this product to anyone investing iin a grill why not spend a couple bucks more so that your 400 grill does n't rust out in two seasons	21
1	this is a quality heavy duty grill cover when you pay good money for a weber grill you want it to stay looking good do n't go buy one of those cheap walmart covers for 10 it will not last and you will end up buying another one in a year or two this cover wasnt cheap but by the looks of it it should last a long time	21
1	i bought two of these weber roasters because they make the process of roasting chicken so easy no can and a nonstick surface make removing the cooked chicken so much easier and clean up is a cinch also because these roasters retain the juices in the pan the inside of my bbq is much cleaner and i do n't have to clean it after every chicken i cook	21
1	man what a awesome weber item it cooked the chicken so well and for clean up was a charm i think im planning to buy another to cook two birds at once	21
1	this item is great it keeps my chicken upright there is no beer can to dispose of after the chicken is cooked no grease gets in my grill it holds the chicken while i carve it and it cleans up super easy i have recommended this product to friends and family	21
1	we already had 2 this was a gift for my father easy to make easy to clean does not make a mess on the bbq like other poultry roasters the pan underneath catches all of the drippings the secret cap keeps all of the moisture in the only way for the liquid to escape is through the chicken therefore very moist	21
1	my family and i love beer can chicken but i did n't like the idea of literally putting my food onto a beer can this weber poultry roaster is so much cleaner and far easier than using a beer can the chicken remains stable too no more trying to balance the chicken on a beer can and it 's a great way to switch from using beer to using wine what a fabulous product	21
1	using this procuct makes changing propane tanks a really quick procedure just remember to pull the outer ring back before installing the male part additional items need to be offered if you are not just ordering an extra one for your weber grill 1 \) an adapter for the propane retailer to fill your tank 2 \) the male portion of this quick connect adapter so that other propane appliances can be attached to your tank it does n't look like it is included as offered the quick connect adapter by itself wo n't do you any good	21
1	heavy guage vinyl grill cover made specifically to fit char broil 65 inch grills covers completely good quality nothing bad to say about the product glad i purchased it to protect my grill in winter	21
1	i was happily surprised with the weight and durability of the grill cover it looks like it will withstand the winter and keep my grill clean and safe the velcro straps help secure the cover tightly to the grill	21
1	grill cover fits perfectly with velcro tabs for end closures previous grill covers were not as well made and had to be held with bungie cords	21
1	an excellent product fits my grill perfectly easy to put on and take off looks like a winner ! one small sewing flaw but otherwise well mad	21
1	the cover is easy to put on and take off it covers completely and has a very sturdy feeling to it it 's a great value ! i would recommend highly	21
1	it took a long while to get this one but it is entirely worth the wait this hammock is wide long and gets a high score for comfort one thing i did n't know was that the hanging kit \( hooks chains \) for this hammock has to be purchased separately \( costs about 15 \) despite that i have to say that it is a great buy for its price	21
1	i got my husband this hammock for father 's day and he loves it no complaints whatsoever	21
1	absolute must have for a golfer ! ! awesome gift ! ! grips are actual golf club grips not cheap imitation the golf ball corn on the cob skewrs are a bonus ! ! the bag and the cover make this set a conversation item not an eye sore	21
1	fun gift that works great ! ! ! ! after receiving one to give i ordered one for myself	21
1	i purchased this item for the offic gift exchange the golfers went crazy for it we have the kind of exchange where you can steal someone else 's gift and this bbq set really made the rounds ! nice quality and is bigger than it looks in the picture	21
1	i have been wanting to try beer can chicken for awhile and my parents just happen to have one of these from a impulse purchase awhile back unused so i got a chicken got some rub popped open a cold one and went to work the stand is a much more stable way of cooking the chicken than just having the can hold up the way the result was one of the most moist chickens i have ever eaten ! i recommend this	21
1	this rack works so much better than trying to balance the chicken on the grill using just the can and the legs now someone has to figure out how to get the chicken off the can after it is cooked	21
1	been using the weather station for a few months now and am pretty satisfied with it temperatures agree okay and humidity is within the accuracy specified by lacrosse the display is a bit busy so i occasionally have trouble finding the information i want quickly	21
1	this is an easy device to set up it works great ! i am very pleased with this produc	21
1	i'm very happy with this product setup was straightforward and the sensor measurements seem to be consistently accurate i think it was a good value i particularly like the outdoor humidity and dew point lcd displays on the body of the outside module in addition to the remote display of the information indoors it is also handy that the remote display shows local time referenced to nist 's wwv	21
1	when i ordered this mitt i did not know any thing about this brand or if i would even like it i found it to be absolutely perfect for my needs it is thick enough that you will not burn your hands but soft enough that the leather will not scrape your hand with prolong use it was just what i wanted	21
1	we own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean \( cobwebs ceiling fans windows etc \) that are out of reach we found this product online and it works great our kids even enjoy using it around the house each attachment is perfect for the task at hand i wish we bought it five years ago	21
1	works well light weight i wish it came with a light bulb changer like some of the other similar system	21
1	this is a great cleaning system for anyone with high walls or vaulted ceilings plus all the attachments make cleaning very versatile i looked at a similar system listed in the frontgate catalog and almost purchased it for more than 120 00 then i found this for less than 40 00 it 's great and i recommend it to anyone who likes to stay cobweb dust free	21
1	this is the greatest cleaning system i 've seen it 's sturdy and i can reach to the top of my cathedral ceilings easily the ceiling fan attachement is great a couple of swipes with this attachement and it 's clean no more standing on a step ladder trying to reach the fan blades	21
1	we have really high ceilings this works great ! and for under 30 you just cant beat it !	21
1	this is a good product i'm very happy with the atachments the squgee works real well its hard to find a good one with treads to screw onto a extention pole the pole should extend to 15 feet its only 10 feet long fully extended but nice and short to carry around in and out of viechels i would order this product just for the attachment	21
1	i was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product i need to point out i am 5'4 i did need the assistance from my boyfriend \( who is 6'1 \) to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs but he did it and they are gone ! i just received my simple clean today and i have already tried three attachments the ceiling fan attachment worked well i used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting loved it ! we also used the spider web remover and it was great ! i recommend this product to everyone !	21
1	this is a sturdy and attractive solution to my patio umbrella problem	21
1	the companion group works to create new and innovative barbecue accessories that exceed expectations being the first to produce the compartmentalized grill basket means we have a learning curve to balance out before attaining perfection we have identified improvements including a simple insertion mechanism for the detachable handle and have stream lined the compartment lids for easy opening and shutting these adjustments have made for superior functionality making this a product we are proud to call part of the steven raichlen line we sincerely apologize and would encourage anyone who received the unsatisfactory product to call our customer service manager \( 800 521 0505 ext 3512 \) and we will replace the item at no additional charge	21
1	this is my first charcoal grill and i will say i bought it because of weber 's reputation for so many years as the best charcoal grill as mentioned it is n't very big for indirect cooking i cook for just my wife and me and it 's fine but too small for cooking for guests if i could do it over again i 'd buy the 22 1 2 grill because of it 's larger cooking area and ability to add the rotisserie attachment i'm not a big rotisserie guy but the extention is needed to cook beer can chicken something i have always loved to cook on gas grills	21
1	i gave the grill to my son and his wife as a housewarming present i think they 've cooked out every weekend since they love it	21
1	the best money i 've spent in a long while got a great bargain at amazon com ! food turns out delicous and it is easy to keep clean charcoal grillers unite ! this is an excellent grill for a small family	21
1	choosing our first grill really was a simple decision we knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while weber was the only way to go in our minds now that we own this grill i can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we do n't use it ! i'm really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer this grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy and for the two of us this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained highly recommended	21
1	i purchased this to monitor my attic and crawl space temperature prior to installation of additional attic ventilation vents and insulation 3 channel readings are accurate to within 0 5 deg f sometimes we lose the signal but it reacquires it relatively easily min max temperature memory is a nice feature	21
1	excellent product my third experienced with oregon scientific products simple to set up and accurat	21
1	just got my thermometer love it i just put the batteries in and it started working ! my kind of item there are other things that can be captured but all i want is to know when it is 12 degrees out love being able to bring it around the house	21
1	i have bought two of these units one for seattle and one for a condo in southern california and they 've both worked well the seattle unit is constantly wet \( like the city and its residents \) and the palm springs unit has no problem with temperatures well above 100 degrees at times neither one has failed yet it is a pain to change the batteries you 'll need the world 's smallest screwdriver to remove the screws that allow you to get inside the unit to change the batteries and the cheap metal bracket that allows the remote unit to stand up outside \? you 'll lose that within a week	21
1	i put the sensor out my backdoor in a shady area about 30 feet from the main unit in the kitchen one screw attaches each item it has three channels it 'll memorize the high and low indoor and outdoor temperature the display is large enough to read from several feet away it 's been installed for several months of silent dependable and accurate temperature monitoring	21
1	this is a great umbrella the quality is excellent for the price and it arrived timely and packaged well the color is not a bright yellow but more of a maize yellow but coordinates well with my brightly striped chair cushions ! i think the more muted color will help keep it looking nice longer i think a brighter yellow would fade and or look discolored sooner	21
1	i purchased this as a christmas present for my husband it arrived in a timely manner \( just in time for christmas \) and in great shape he really never asks for much but he wanted this we went to the smokies for christmas and he got to try it out searching for gold ! needless to say he loves it ! i would highly recommend it for anyone looking for some fun	21
1	we are growing this in arizona and having a fair amount of luck so far the plants are thriving well it helped to start them in peat pots the soil here is clay so after they had their second leaves we transplanted them into the garden for our first time they have n't been much trouble yet easy seeds to grow	21
1	i needed a big table to put my cpu keyboard screen and printer with room for papers and prints the 8ft lifetime table is perfect for my needs it is sturdy neat attractive and portable a must have for every home office	21
1	i 've only used my rack for cooking chickens but i'm looking forward to doing a turkey soon i 've never sprayed the rack with non stick cooking spray there 's no need to everything comes off and it cleans up beautifully in the dishwasher i like the fact that i can put the chicken on the rack way before i put it on the grill the rack makes it easy to get the chicken back into the house too i typically put the rack and cooked chicken on a cookie sheet and carve the chicken right on the rack well made tons of uses yet inexpensive does it get any better	21
1	we did have one of these items before and ours was just at the end of it 's life so the only place we ould find another one was through weber we love it	21
1	we not only use this for roasts we cradle chicken turkey and pork rolls for cooking also we have been pleased so far the nickel plated steel rack cleans easily too	21
1	we purchased this grill to take with us when we go camping it is small and does not take up too much room however you can fit a lot of food on it this is a great weber product	21
1	i was really hoping for a larger grill but i should have read the measurements ! after reading the directions you have to put a foil drip pan in the bottom and surround this with your coals then if you are cooking something that needs a longer cooking time you have to keep adding coals i do n't get how you would do this if you have a grill full of hot food seems a little inconvenient to me it will be okay for a few burgers and dogs but i think i 'll invest in a larger grill next time	21
1	this is my second smokey joe the first one \( about 11 years old \) really only needed the charcoal grate so i figured i 'd get a new grate and pass that one on to one of my children and have a new one for me although it 's relatively small in size i 've done 7 big burgers or 5 6 chicken breast quarters with smoked sausage at one time and it does n't require a big amount of charcoal to do the job after cleaning the cooking grate and the housing it now looks almost new would i recommend it you bet	21
1	absolutly love this item so nice to even without glasses at night look up see time temp ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	21
1	i sent this to a male friend of mine i find men difficult to shop for however this was an excelelnt choice it actually does project the time onto the wall or ceiling according to my friend the alarm works well and is loud enough there is a unit that you place outside and it recieves the accurate time from an atomic clock that it then broadasts back to the in house unit it also acts as a thermometer so you know the outside temp your man should be pleased with this	21
1	works great i have wanted a projection clock for quite some time this one works wonderfully and the cost was wonderful also i still have not installed the outside sensor as i'm trying to find the perfect location you ca n't go wrong with this one	21
1	this is great for people like me that are never sure when the steaks are done to the stage i want !	21
1	this thermometer is terrific it works quickly and the handle is long enough that you do n't burn yourself on the heat from the coals i highly recommend this product	21
1	the only outdoor bbq thermometer that i could find with a lighted digital readout easy to see in the dim light outside at the bbq reliable accurate and easy to use at an affordable pric	21
1	i am a southern guy from ga and have been using outside cookers all of my adult life this one is a winner you ca n't go wrong with this purchase if you enjoy using an outside cooker with the various size cooking pots you can cook for 2 or 20 very simple to set up and use i really like this one and the price was a bargin	21
1	this turkey fryer was a superb price compared to the stores it was delivered right to my door on next day service and the turkeys came out juicy tasty and i was told to never use an oven again it also made corn on the cob capons veggies and zeppoles so easy and so tasty i set it up to my barbeque gas connection and voila` it feels like my kitchen was extended onto the patio great idea and thanks amazon for your service	21
1	bought it and deep fried a turkey very juicy even after rewarming in the microwave the next day i did end up ripping the hose out of the end of this thing though i pulled it gently when moving it and it came right out oops	21
1	very happy with it my husband and i use herbs from it frequently it produces so much we have had to trim and freeze some of the leaves for later use	21
1	heavy duty and sturdy cover attachment to wheel to keep from blowing away in wind is great vent pockets and storage pocket also very handy	21
1	first experience with this brand very well made elegant i actually had my first compliment ever what a good looking bar b q cover if it holds up well during our 100 summer desert heat i 'll definately choose this brand again along with the great amazon service	21
1	we had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds we ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly w o special instructions to do so when we received it it was a bit thinner than i wanted but for the price and fast delivery it was great ! ! ! the material is durable and of good quality our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it 's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear like i said it 's a bit thinner than i wanted but a good buy	21
1	they are handsome and nicer than i expected by far the fabric has a really nice quality strong pleasantly textured durable and a fine rich color they 're handsome well stitched and sturdy very comfortable and are holding up to the sun some rain too i must admit these were a terrific deal	21
1	i ordered this to go along with the teak lounge chair and both of them turned out to be a great deal only took one day to arizona and so far no color change from the every day sun	21
1	nice fabric and construction backordered item came 3 weeks before expected fabric color was a little darker than it appeared on the website but that ca n't always be helped	21
1	these are very nice quality and comfortable everything was as expected and came in just a few days	21
1	cushions look great on chaise loungers bright dark green in color cushion get very hot in the sun items arrive well boxed and well before promised date	21
1	great value look fantastic on the chairs excellent price could n't be happier	21
1	nice cushions that dry out pretty fast seem durable they also seem high quality the only thing is they are more of a tan color the picture shows them as white which is what i really wanted but they are nice could use a strap at the top also so the wind does n't constantly blow them over	21
1	i am finding the batteries are doing better than most rechargeables i have bought seem to have a good battery life no leaking problems if i did i would just return	21
1	the quality or this product outshines most outdoor wicker i have seen at twice the price the sofa also is very nice and again quality is outstanding i am concerned about delivery of the chairs to complete my collection as the previous customer has mentioned amazon what is going on \? suppliers need to be more diligent in shipping collections together	21
1	i did n't know much about grills so i asked around everyone told me to get a weber grill and after reading reviews i could see why i just got my grill this weekend and we have used it 3 times already we love it ! very sturdy solid and super easy to use all you need to do is turn the gas on turn a knob and press the ignitor ! everything we have cooked has come out perfectly very even cooking this grill may not have all the bells and whistles but you can bet it will last for years to come	21
1	this product is great in the beginning when i received it i did n't use it often and was skeptical about it one thing you have to practice how to use it rihgt it looks kina simple but and with this fork you have to know how to catch perfect temperature it work flawless no disappointments recommend try it	21
1	accurate and easy to use just push the button amd insert better for grilling than oven work a bit bigger than i would like but not too long maybe a foot and it does keep your hand safely away from splattering oil very accurate and sturdy the on and off label has come unglued on mine so i need to reglue it	21
1	i have hosted three cookouts with my new weber grill and have yet to find anything i do n't like about it i am so glad that i spent the little extra i had purchased a gas grill 5 years ago thinking that i needed to go in that direction fact is i used it less and was pretty unhappy going back to charcoal is easy to explain however explaining why this grill is so great is very hard i guess you would just have to sample my cooking \)	21
1	i bought this grill for my husband even though we already had a weber i thought he might appreciate the added features this one offers i was right he raves about it every time he uses it !	21
1	we bought our performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store it was the best purchase we ever made ! its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition about 15 20 minutes you 're ready to grill for the people who own a gas grill and are considering the performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal its a piece of cake \( we had our reservations too ! \) and you 're going to wish you switched sooner food never tasted so good	21
1	i 've had this grill for one summer now and cannot say enough good things about it ours was recently blown off the patio by a particularly nasty windstorm and survived without hardly a scratch for those concerned about the price when you look at all the extra features not just the ignition system but the work table the charcoal bin and the tool rack it really is worth every penny plus consider for this price what sort of gas grill could you get	21
1	this is truely a must have the flat non stick skewers holds everything in place they wo n't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for 7 39 a set but i checked here 1st and found them for 5 99 a set i ordered 5 sets ! ! the skewers are 14 long for plenty of food get yours today do n't wait get at least 2 sets	21
1	a great portable shelter for sun and rain we bought it for a backyard event to give some shelter if it had rained the weather turned out to be great and sunny so the shelter was used to give our guest some shades from the bright sun it was easy to set up and bring down and the roller bag is also a good accessory to have to store and tranport the shelter easily	21
1	i am delighted with my lifetime tables just what i was looking for and also affordable a visiting friend liked them so much she ordered one for her office joann	21
1	i have one of these this one is for my sister 's motorhome it makes a great little game or card table eating doing a small craft table folds up nicely and has a height adjustment	21
1	this table with its adjustable height was just what i needed it 's strong easy to adjust and stable after it 's set up	21
1	product arrived in superb condition and got here 2 weeks before i thought that it would what a smooth transaction ! !	21
1	the bench is easy to assemble and lid actuallydoes work well it is not an item that will lastforever but it is priced fairly for what it is a storagebench	21
1	not a bad product quite sturdy for being made of plastic and all the pieces simply snapping together don't assemble it if the pieces are cold i shattered two pieces trying after the shipping box was in single digit weather overnight let it warm up first ! grinny from m	21
1	i purchased this for my deck i needed a place to store the seat cushions and bench cushion when not in use this bench is awesome it is waterproof and has a good amount of storage space easily assembled with out any tools great extra seating for outdoor parties	21
1	this storage bench is great for storing pool items or anything you keep outside it was easy to put together and i got it on the friday sale for 69 99 so the price was awesome ! all other benches like this that i researched were over 100 0	21
1	the price was right the bench was larger than i expected which was a nice thing it went together easily and works great the company does not list measurements on the amazon web site and i think they would sell more of them through amazon if they did	21
1	this coffee table is great for the money well packed for shipping and easy to put together	21
1	this table is about twice the table you would expect at the price its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench kompur wood is so like teak we 're staining our teak furniture to match the kompur wood it looks marvelous with the 30 round folding table fit and finish are a plus ca n't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars	21
1	my only reservation is that i had no choice on the specific type of basil plants i receive some of the ones in the kit are not ones i am interested in	21
1	i have had this smoker for about 8 years as i live on the east coast of florida it has been subjected to a great many adverse conditions sun rain heat salt air and the occasional 150 mph sandblasting the only degradation that it has experienced was that the 2 legs \( without the wheels \) need replacing due to rusting off at the bottom and the grills had to be replaced maintenance is a snap just regular cleaning and an occasional coat of oven black she may not be the youngest lady at the ball but she still makes the best ribs chicken and steak	21
1	i have had mine for 4 years and it has worked out great the main difference between this offset barbecue and more expensive ones is the lack of complete air control there are simply too many open seams to allow in air so it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at 215f that said with a bit of patience and practice you can make excellent barbecue on this thing the metal gauge is heavy enough to last you several years \( though eventually the firebox will burn out \)	21
1	what a great piece of equipment elegant in its simplicity seems very sturdy easy to assemble if you organize first ! offers many cooking options well made great price wonderful brisket ca n't wait till thanksgiving smoked turkey yum ! have it covered in yard but will use year round	21
1	i purchased this last year and i love this grill i always check consumer reports and they rated this very highly i agree cooking is a cinch on this grill wide grill and cooks evenly ! the only way this grill will catch fire is if you do not clean the grease after each cooking session fortunately lowe 's was putting a whole bunch of of these grills together when i was looking for one so i bought one fully assembled way cool	21
1	i bought this grill locally after researching many others i originally did not want a side burner but have been very happy with it it works great for cooking vegetables in a pan and is superb with the griddle for cooking breakfast i can cook an entire dinner or breakfast without using the stove i do agree that it did take a long time to assemble \( about 2 hrs \) but is solid and works beautifully i would highly recommend this grill for the money it is a great deal	21
1	after a few years of use the original rack on my gold c grill was rusty and unusable this is the exact replacement and fits like the original making the grill that much more usuable again	21
1	as i roamed through the vast depths of home depot i came upon a light which shown down on the stinger uv 40 my eyes light up like a child on christmas morning i raced home to try out the product at approximately 6pm without hanging the unit up which violates the warnings in the instruction manual we zapped numerous insects currently it is 11pm and we have a pile of bugs reaching to the heavens this product is highly recommended because it decemated the entire insect community in the 80210 zip code while offering hours of entertainment	21
1	the hammock is fine particularly for the great price unfortunately my pine trees dripped sap onto the hammock which is a pain to get off not the hammock 's fault i guess it just was n't such a good idea	21
1	accurate easy to program and good to look at well worth the spent	21
1	the device shows a lot of info like it should nice design and accurate as well it 's just as good if not better than the television weather forecast and current conditions the only thing i would improve upon is the readability of the face of the instrument it has to be read from directly in front or it is not clear enough	21
1	the ws 9119u weather station monitors outside temp and humidity and inside temp and humidity further it monitors barometric pressure and make a gross prediction of weather change via pictoral representations of weather for the price it serves a function but it 's not an all encompasing scientific weather station most of which cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars this unit is good to observe outside weather conditions monitor inside conditions and monitor gross weather change for this it a a reliable and relatively inexpensive instrument	21
1	the cover is great the velcro holds the cover in place by wrapping around the handles preventing the wind from blowing it off it 's nice to leave the fireplace out in the winter knowing it is protected from the elements	21
1	i really like these clocks our school was constantly having problems with the clocks in all the classrooms being different and this has really helped the situation the digital ones are better but the la crosse ones which are the least expensive also happen to be the best analog clocks we 've tried	21
1	the other reviewers accurately captured the clock 's great features i will add that its radio reception is great too i put the battery in about 6 00 pm in california yesterday may 31 expecting it to get the correct time overnight i noticed the second hand move a bit and stop and thought d it 's broken already not so ! while reading the instructions to see what happened with the clock resting on the floor it started advancing to the exact correct time having received the radio signal in a minute since start the clock is now in my office and i do n't have to wonder if i have the correct time or not	21
1	this clock was very easy to set up pop in a battery and within 5 minutes it sets itself it 's large face and numbers are easy to read at a distance making it perfect for business use it was only a few dollars more than a clock with no automatic time setting so it was worth it to me to have at least one clock i 'll only have to check when the battery wears down	21
1	this cushion is extra long and extra thick and should work with most any chaise lounge it has really firm support not one of those puffy things that go flat in one season i highly recommend it	21
1	i searched a long time for a cushion to fit an old lounge chair which had slightly larger measurements for the new cushions at most stores today horray ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this one is perfect and has served me well for comfort and weather resistance it has been an unusually rainy month of may and the cushion justs dries with little or no wiping so comfortable too	21
1	this unit was harder to set up than others i have had however for the price and options it 's a great buy	21
1	i purchased my oregon scientific station 8 years ago the internal sensor batteries need changed annually and i 've changed the rechargeables outside once i live in georgia and we get lots of sun other than needing to reset the unit about every 6 months \( gets confused by near lightning strikes but then what wireless electronics do n't \? \) and perhaps not the high precision rain gauge i 'd like to have it 's more than adequate for any home weather enthusiast	21
1	good product in general one came a bit bent and the clever automatic lock unlock would n't work until i unbent it i ordered 3 was billed for three and received 2 amazon is now junk in my inbox	21
1	well sometimes it pays to take a chance after reading a negative review of these tongs i went ahead and bought them anyway i do love steven raichlen 's show and his books well either i have a disagreement with the earlier review or they fixed 'em these tongs work great are very heavy duty for handling big slabs of meat like i like to cook and the extra length keeps my hands cool without gloves i vote 5 stars keep on bbq'ing	21
1	i use this for tailgating primarily it is great because it 's cooking size much bigger than it 's counterparts it holds temps well and cooks evenly like all webers do it 's a bit bigger than the smaller smokey joe but does a nicer job because of it 's size i use it often and will continue to do so too bad it is being discontinued	21
1	this is a great portable grill for the size the 14 one would be fine for 1 2 people but not more this grill can handle more charcoal and has enough room to allow for 2 heat zones the hardest part is finding one ! i finally found one on ebay but you better hurry !	21
1	i just had my platinum grill stolen and i'm not only devestated but having a hard time finding one available just found one at ace this is the perfect grill for anything let 's rally weber to make this more available !	21
1	weber discontinued it and amazon no longer has it my pal has a condo with a balcony \( not large \) this is the weber for her equip it with one charcoal rail and you get lots of indirect heat for smoking usually the 14 inch smokey joe 's are too small often my 22 inch performer is too big but this jumbo joe is just right weber bring it back ! !	21
1	i love this grill just last night i made pizza on it for the first time it 's got a awesome amount of cooking space for such a portable grill it 's great we use it on our patio all the time the build quality is great and it 's very easy to cleani think they even added some vents into the design so the airflow is awesome and with amazons free shipping you cant find a better deal anywhere	21
1	this is an excellent little grill for home or the road the lid lock is a godsend and the side benefit is that due to the construction of the piece smokey joe is an apt name the carry handle is awesome the side vents direct air such that i almost always have beautiful smoke filling my little grill and infusing my meal with fabulous flavor i 've had mine for over a decade and while i 've gone through another big weber kettle and now a huge smoker this little number is still in the race and i have no intentions of giving it up i'm taking it camping with me next weekend it 's a no brainer buy it and be happy	21
1	this is a fantastic grill i highly recommend it if you are looking for a high quality basic grill assembly was rather easy and we were grilling the same evening	21
1	this is our second weber grill in the past 10 years in fact the new grill is essentially the exact same grill as the one we purchased in the '90s same size and features we actually use natural gas rather than propane \( i goofed on the order \) but we were able to quickly transplant the conversion kit from the old grill to the new one we 've used it a few times and it works perfectly quickly heats up and grills evenly looking forward to many years of great meals off this grill	21
1	this weather station give reliable outdoor weather consistently i had a cheaper one that would lose the outside temperature on a regular basis that has not happened with the la crosse ws 8025 read the owners manual there are alot of features to set up	21
1	took it out of the box 7 minutes later i was watching the weather inside and out would recommend highly	21
1	first i would like to say with a bit of trial and error this is a very good product well worth the price i want to comment on the great technical support from la crosse and the super customer support from amazon the first unit i received was faulty due to being calibrated wrong left la crosse a voice mail and was called within 36 hours tried to trouble shoot to no avail la crosse followed up next day e mailed amazon about issue replacement was in mail the next day outstanding	21
1	you 'll need a large throw pillow for a back cushion 20 at least also the chair is fairly low seat cushion is okay about the same quality as target or home depot construction is plastic wicker over a steel frame so i suspect some rusting over the years overall a very nice chair at a decent price point if you want a nice patio chair cover that fits fairly well check out veranda patio chair cover 78932 on amazon \( 19 each \) the cover is heavy duty and is waterproof	21
1	this chair is stylish and comfortable it 's hard to tell what the wicker is made of which does not look like plastic \( even though i suspect it is \) the wicker is smooth and looks high quality the cushion is firm and deep we 've had it a while now and it 's stood up to rough treatment from our kids delivery was unexpectedly quick within ten days	21
1	we love these chairs ! we have been looking and did n't want to spend 1000 dollars just for one chair we ended up buying 4 chairs and the sofa the look great around our pool and all our friends rave about them we had seen some chairs from frontgate and these were just as good but at a fraction of the cost	21
1	i bought 2 of these chairs back in june 06 they are great ! they are built well and look wonderful very comfortable and roomy i have them in an area that gets diffused light but they got rained on alot with winter upon us i now have them stored outside under a protective cover i would definately buy more of this line local stores want 300 400 for a chair of this quality great buy	21
1	received this item and its great ! ! i have this under a gazebo and wanted an asian modern look with straight lines this was perfect the type of wicker \( actually plastic \) is very durable the cushions are thick and actually solid some are real soft \( cheap \) these are not this chair is really wide and sits low to the ground i could not have asked for better i bought the whole set and everything is great email me with any questions chris schaffner gmail com orange county c	21
1	i love it looks good performes perfectly only thing i would like it better if it displayed the outdoor relative humidity numbers are large enough to see from a long distance i would buy it again	21
1	the clock was as good as advertised simple to get up running as accurate as promised and very useful it is also an attractive item to have on my wall strongly recommend	21
1	we bought this for an intelligent 95 year old woman who wanted lots of information at her finger tips she knows immediately the date time day of the week and weather prediction it is very ugly but does the job perfectly ! !	21
1	good price for a good working clock clock sets itself in about 24 hours not bad would have been nice if had acutal barometric pressures instead of the picture of the sun or clouds and trending arrow	21
1	i 've been looking for an atomic clock with functions and design i finally found it with the 8249 the large display is very nice all info are logically located on the display one quick glance and i know the time indoor outdoor temp humidity day date and month the clock update itself about 2 to 3 times a day i ca n't really ask for more than this especially the price on amazon was really good	21
1	as far as the variety of hummingbird feeders go this is in a category all its own you got your basic plastic molded crappy looking feeders your glass bouble oddly resembling a hanging easter egg type feeders then this lovely mobile which even empty in winter makes a lovely display	21
1	i got this feeder for my husband for christmas last year and recently purchased another as a house gift it is lovely even when not filled and is sturdy even though it looks delicate we have had several storms with hard wind and rain and had no problems the glass globes are easy to fill and clean it has not attracted many hummingbirds but as many as the nearby red flowers we did not notice any bees until late october and then only a few	21
1	this solved my problem of ants in the feeder had it hanging on our deck all summer long and they never got to it ! this feeder is also very easy to clean and because it is made of glass does not pick of that aging hazy appearance i highly recommend it to anyone	21
1	i just received the feeder this morning and hung it up in my yard i put sugar water in the globes and had a hummingbird feed from it within just 2 hours of hanging it up ! i was impressed but this feeder is not as cute as shown in the picture it is actually big and bulky also the construction is sub par looks kinda cheap and plasticy	21
1	i am impressed with the accuracy and durability of this item but it is far from instant read i conduct several temperatue audits for a major food chain and many of the readings take several minutes to stabilize overall it is worth the cost	21
1	this thermometer has been very useful it registers the temperature quickly and the numbers are easy to read even with bi focals the cover becomes a handle so your fingers do n't get to close to the flame when grilling i would recommend it	21
1	wow is all i can say my dreams have come true with my cherry tomato kit for indoor tomato 's just growing crazy and most of all it is fun to see them progress once they end and are spent i plan on replacing them again with the cherry tomato kit as nothing is like a cherry tomato right off the vine ! happy as all can be	21
1	this durable grill mat does an excellent job the product 's material absorbs grease without burning or warping in my opinion what i like best about it is that it catches and holds the majority of solid particles which fall from the grill \( which turn into hard to clean stains just as often as grease \) it is very easy to clean i highly recommend this product	21
1	i am using this clock indoors very nice looks and large enough to use on a big wall without looking cheap the main concern i had before getting this was the battery life i have heard bad stories about some atomic clocks using up a battery \( s \) in as little as 30 45 days but since receiving this 3 months ago it 's still going strong on the first charge of the rechargeable battery i put in i really like the fact that i can easily tell what time it is from across the room and down the hall without my glasses even being pretty badly near sighted	21
1	we have had it on our patio for about 4 months and it works great the numbers are clear enoungh to see from our pool area	21
1	i purchased this for indoor use so it has worked great for what i wanted it to do everything works flawlessly plus it 's a big enough size that you can see it easily across the room	21
1	keeps perfect time and looks great on the outdoor wall of my patio a classy looking clock	21
1	sorry to see the other poor reviews of this product because we think this is the best thing since sliced bread ! we bought four of these pest repellers and found that they kill all the flies and spiders in the house we have lots of plants that are breeding grounds for fruit flies this product disrupts their teeny little lives and no sooner are some hatched than they disappear we have to vacuum up the dead house flies and spiders periodically and we have black decker to thank ! i'm buying more for the rest of the house and garage and for gifts	21
1	we have a brinkmann 810 7080 7 gourmet electric smoker grill and when using it the first time we were really impressed with the end product pork spareribs we put a dry rub on the ribs including 1 mccormick grill mates mesquite2 garlic salt3 onion salt4 lemon pepperwe put blocks of hickery wood around the electric coil in the bottom of the smoker we are not sure if the ribs had either a mesquite or hickkery smoke flavor but they were outstanding	21
1	have only used the smaller chicken base chicken came out great easy to fill cooker with whatever savory concoction one likes imparts nice flavor and moistness to the birds easy to clean should not have to pay for two turkey cookers to get two chicken cookers though	21
1	these herbs are too young to taste yet but they are coming along ! i previously grew the salad greens which thrived but were n't as handy as having fresh herbs growing especially when one considers the high prices of fresh herbs at the grocery store i am just trying to be patient and check out the growth on a daily basis	21
1	this wood chip soaker actually does what it is supposed to do smart design no instructions needed compact well made likely to be long lived	21
1	i use this along with the 807 bbq fork for the bbq and the smoker i use the bbq fork for grilling and this for smoking and roasting the lighted digital dial allows me to see the temperature and settings in dim light the alarm tells me when the desired temperature is reached the silicone coated probe is very sturdy and has been problem free	21
1	i have been very pleased with my hammock chair this past summer the pillow was a real bonus my kids and i can hang out in the yard for hours	21
1	i have used medium sized kongs as abreakfast lunch dinner bucket for ourbichon for over five years i stuff it witha dried liver treat a combination ofeukanuba and max and a medium dog bone his five to eight trips a day for kongrefills provides a break from my sedentaryhome office activities recently i hadcollapsed lung surgery and now usethe filling of kongs for a six minutetreadmill break he now joins me on thetreadmill for about the first three minutesbefore jumping off to work on his latestkong kongs are a lasting feature in our lives the amazon provider of a two years supplyof kongs \( 6 \) was excellent and very competitivelypriced i recommend both the kong and supplierat a 5 star level	21
1	you know beagles love chewing my new beagle who came from a shelter loves to chew i mean he loves chewing anything he sees ! ! ! since my husband and i work fulltime and we have to leave him in a crate all day every morning i stuff low sodium peanut butter and dog treat and he loves it lick and chew all day ! and even after all day chewing the kong does n't break at all i also like the kong bounds and rolls everywhere because of the funny shape and he loves to chase this is the best dog toy i 've ever got	21
1	i used this feeder last season and now i am getting a second one to hang nearby it 's the best feeder i 've ever used \( and i think i 've tried them all ! \) for this reason it is a cinch to clean the metal flowers are part of the metal base which screws off easily you just wash and go ! there are no weird angles to try and get a brush into or thick plastic flowers that attract black gunk and wo n't let it go and the hummers love it ! if you have to choose one feeder this season this is the one i recommend	21
1	i have been very pleased with my hammock chair this past summer the pillow was a real bonus my kids and i can hang out in the yard for hours	21
1	i ordered one wren house and when it arrived i thought it was well made and a reasonable price i ordered two more the houses are sturdy the entrance hole is exactly the right size and the style is appealing now we have to see if the wrens agree	21
1	nice good looking grill good price with free shipping 4 stars for minor bends from shipment arrived two days earlier than scheduled clear instructions you can put it together in less than an hour cooks nice cleans easy recomended	21
1	this platter is suitable for serving a main entree as it is bigger than the average plate metal insert comes out easily for cleaning have owned it for over a year and it has been durable no complaints	21
1	easy to assemble lightweight but solid enough for outside comfortable to sit in and eat on the table top is a bit springy but all in all perfect for tight spaces	21
1	bought these for my dad for christmas he saw the box they came in and thought it was a poker set lol he 's always wanted a grill set i love the fact that they are all one piece of stainless nothing to break the only reason i give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the box seems kinda cheap and was a little damaged not to the point were i would need to get rid of it just poor workmanship	21
1	we gave this set to my dad for christmas and he was very impressed it has plenty of sturdy all aluminum tools and the case is awesome too	21
1	i shopped around localy and online to replace my worn out grates i found that the best price was from amazon for this product theitem can quickly and my weber looks almost like new again	21
1	elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put oxo good grips on the grip map i bought this to complete my good grips bbq set the only thing it lacks that some bbq'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle but that does n't bother me seeing as i do n't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design if the dog does n't get ahold of it it will last a lifetime	21
1	our storage shed is perfect ! we are very pleased with the quality size of this unit ! our shed was delivered via eagle usa and i must say this company is awesome a we had never dealt with this company before they called me ahead to set up a delivery time the truck arrived exactly on time \( earlier actually \) the driver was extremely polite very helpful very neat tidy ! ! ! the paperwork was precise legible ! hopefully we will get to use eagle usa in the future ! ! thank you ! sincerely deborah slessinger	21
1	i am impressed with this product all the parts were clearly marked all the parts were included in the box the directions were excellent no complaints here	21
1	this is a good brush i think it is a bit overpriced though i would have rather saved the money and got another brush it 's good but not worth this much	21
1	i was nervous about installing kit but it was easy took me maximum 10 minutes and works well	21
1	works great switched from the old quick release to the new design \( which seems to be the only thing they carry nowadays !	21
1	for the price this is a very nice fire pit it looks good and works fine i did find the instructions a bit more complicated than they needed to be but it was not hard to put together	21
1	this outdoor bird cage is ideal in the winter because it has a strong wire mesh that prohibits piles of snow or manure to fall into the living area of the bird works well with mostly smaller birds plenty of room for seeds and water even a furry friend or two can also substitute for a squirrel cage or a mini buddhist temple for midgets	21
1	upon receiving this planter i was quite surprised at the quality of it for the bargain price having no yard but a heavily planted balcony i do a lot of container gardening and have purchased many pots planters and window boxes of various sizes and shapes at local stores one thing that especially shocked me was the fact that the tray was included at the low price it surely deserves the quot ppp quot ! thanks a lot for the pot	21
1	love the projection clock but the alarm is not very loud its also very easy to change the settings without realizing it	21
1	this is a great desk top or night stand clock projection to view time requires it to be dark but it is great projection requires the clock to be plugged in with the included adapter batteries are used for backup and normal view	21
1	oregon scientific atomic projection clocks are great i have three of these closcks and am looking forwared to buying 2 more	21
1	its excellent but with black paintings it doesnt reflect too much i recommend i	21
1	it 's not the best grill in the world but for the price it does the job well enough it cooks unevenly the front and the back of the grill are hotter than the center	21
1	these birdie hose reels are such a nice addition to my yard i bought two packs and have lined my front garden with them they are a very nice heavy weight and the overall detail is much more then i expected especially for this price i agree the stakes could have been an inch longer however i am having no issues with the size of my hose fitting into the track i am not sure what size hose the other customer is using it must be a professional grade hose ready for spring !	21
1	for the money 10 99 i wish i had bought another set now that i see the price has risen these are heavy and they stay in the ground where put i have had no problem whatsoever with them coming up due to pressure from the hose my hose is very long ultra heavy and thick and the guides keep the hose from going into my plants at the corners they are also very good looking and are a complement to the yard now that the price lowered to 9 99 i bought three more in december 2006 the new ones have the same quality as the earlier one	21
1	the hose guides were exactly as pictured in the ad they are worth the price considering the cost of other hose guides i have researched on the internet i recommend them	21
1	you ca n't really beat this for 12 ! it 's fairly attractive and seems pretty well made it seems as though it will do a pretty good job at removing dirt etc from shoes as the bristles on it are very tough and the crevaces are alot bigger than you can see in the picture this would cost at least 10 more in the stores thinking about buying one for my other 2 entry doors	21
1	this is a thick attractive doormat it 's also quite heavy has n't budged in inch in high winds i'm very pleased with the purchase	21
1	i got the mat for my sister so i never actually saw it in person since we do n't live in close proximity to each other she uses the mat in an enclosed apartment hallway for guests to wipe their feet after treading through the snow i do n't know if it would hold up directly in the elements but it seems to do the job in the setting that my sister uses it upon receiving the mat she was pleased with its functionality and style	21
1	the lewis hyman athens doormat is a very good product it looks good at the door and takes care of all dirt and debris from your shoes that would otherwise be brought in the house it is a beautiful addition to my home	21
1	larger than i expected and thick heavy good quality and definately worth the price	21
1	clock was a great value and looks good on the wall just keeps ticking always on time thumps up to river city clock	21
1	it is a very nice looking clock i received it in the early afternoon i placed it on the wall in my home office it repeatedly failed to adjust itself over the next three hours i removed it and placed it facing outward against the pane of a north facing window it adjusted to the correct time within 15 minutes i rehung it in the home office and it has been keeping good time every since i am very happy with the value that i received for my money	21
1	it is a very attractive wall clock that keeps accurate time it is easy toview from a distant it also made the time adjustment for day light savingtime	21
1	this is a great clock when i bought it about a week ago i put the battery in the clock and placed it on the wall in my family room where my old clock used to be that was it at first the clock appeared to be broken but within 5 minutes it adjusted itself and has been running perfectly ever since this clock can be seen clearly in my family room from 25ft away as i get older i like things to be bigger and this clock gets the job done while still looking attractive my wife likes the clock because she does not confuse the short hand with the long hand from a distance	21
1	this is a beautiful time piece and looks better after it 's hung on the wall the fine woodwork and craftmanship that was put in to this clock makes this a fine addition to my home the atomic function of the clock works just like it was designed i put the battery in it and that 's it it took nearly six hours to adjust to the accurate time but it 's designed to receive the radio signal overnight or when you have the best reception i highly recommend this clock it is more than i expected	21
1	just got it yesterday it took a few hours for the clock to adjust to correct time it is accurate and quiet it 's a beauty too this is the 4th la crosse atomic clock in my house \( first analog one \) recommanded	21
1	this cooking utensil is unlike any other its intricate design is for the dumbest cooker or even a gormet french dude little do you know that this fork can be used as a stress reliever as well say for example that your meat is not turning out well at all infact it does n't seem to look like meat anymore just crap well with this fork you can whack the meat stab it and then hurl it across the yard and trust me you 'll feel much better	21
1	i bought this for my husband for christmas to replace an old \( scary looking \) smoker it was a real pain having to ask his folks to send mesquite wood from texas to massachusetts then cut it up soak it etc we tried the bradley smoker this weekend while we had the unusually warm weather it comes with pellets of wood which get fed in automatically much easier the prime rib was done in no time at all we finished it off in the oven for a crispier outside we also smoked fresh kielbasa both were amazing ca n't wait to try the cold smoke feature	21
1	i bought this for my husband in december we put it in december 25 \( we have an acre for our back yard \) with about 40 mole holes the ground has been freezing on and off and we put one in the middle of an old hole takes 3 d batteries and believe it or not the thing is still vibrating \( sounds kind of irritating if your close \) but who cares beats the back yard looking like a new cemetery no new holes you could chew more juicy fruit which the kids love to help out with for our small front yard but that only lasts you about 3 weeks i m buying another for the front yard	21
1	not sure if they are needed but a good replacement for the grills that come with the grill stay cleaner do not rust and work as advertised	21
1	this hose hanger is sturdy and lovely and adds some much needed character to the front of our house ! a great deal	21
1	i am very pleased with the hose hanger big and sturdy plus it does not look cheap my only problem is that one of the leaves broke off already but for the price it 's a really good buy	21
1	this is beautiful birdbath if placed on solid ground \( walkway concrete \) it will be great however if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom a wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip however it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright i am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch	21
1	i gave it to someone as a gift and they loved it great shipping too	21
1	i bought it to clean up my yard after a roofing job i found a ton of nails and a few other things that i have lost over the years great for the kids to treasure hunt too	21
1	i purchased this for my 7 year old granddaughter who was actually asking for one that was more of a toy she loves it it works very well and has opened up a whole new area of interest for her it 's well made and easy for a child to use	21
1	timely arrival easy to use just the right size for my 10 year old daughter the only suggetion i would offer is to have plain brown packaging this was a christmas gift and arrived on our doorstep the box made it very obvious what was inside	21
1	this pizza cooker works really well i have a grill large enough to use 4 at a time a couple of hints for using the cooker turn pan 180 degrees ocationally for more even cooking and when dough is just starting to get firm slide a non stick spatula under to lift dough out of the holes in the pan	21
1	i use this for hand tossed pizzas and it works quite well it takes about 11 minutes to cook in a grill that has been pre heated about 15 minutes the pizza cooks evenly and the crust is perfectly done my only gripe is that i wish you could get a bigger pan so that one could cook a larger \( 14 17 \) pizza	21
1	i have ordered 4 of these pizza cookers i love em takes half the time as the oven and your house stays cooler the dough i get at trader joes pizzas are golden brown they make great gifts	21
1	i just ordered my third za grill today i have a large grill and entertain a lot it really makes a great pizza and great for experimenting get one you wo n't believe it too bad it was n't made in the usa	21
1	used it tonight for the first time made 5 pizzas with an average cook time 8 minutes bottom was a golden brown with very even cooking a very good simple design faster than a real brick oven bob pratl gloucester mass	21
1	the zagrill rocks i had issues at first because i trusted my grill 's temperature gauge after i was given an in the grill thermometer and adjusted to the proper temperature my wife and i could not be more happy with the results grilled pizza \( and a glass of wine \) all summer long and no mess	21
1	it is used as a computer desk clock but have also used it during travel really like that world time feature and the attractive styling	21
1	this clock was given as a gift along with the bird bath and it was really appreciated by the individual who received it it was larger than we expected which is great for a back yard it was a very nice quality and the temp humidity dials are a great plus	21
1	i'm a first home buyer so with the nice weather coming up i decided that i needed a grill so i wanted something that i could smoke too so the char broil smoker seemed like the ideal grill assembly was simple took about 30 min i highly recommend using sockets and also using two different types of screw drivers a bigger bit size 3 and a 1 that will make the job easier also i just bought mine at walmart for 79 00 havent used it yet but the concept seems simple enough probably only be able to fit 2 slabs of ribs on it so cooking for a huge group wont be possible	21
1	this is a great item my three kids love watching the temp change as well as the highs and lows their friends have also commented on it when they visit we liked it so much that we just got it for some friends moving to hong kong where the highs will be high in the summer !	21
1	i paid 200 and free shipping for two chairsthey look like they are worth at least twice that amountglad i ordered them	21
1	worth more than the price tag beautiful and elegant you will be very pleased	21
1	i am thrilled with this purchase i had initially ordered 4 chairs and the companion dining table upon its delivery i went back and ordered another pair of chairs they are very comfortable generously proportioned their overall styling very beautiful to the eye i have subsequently received many compliments on this set i just wish they sold a larger matching table i plan on ordering the companion loveseat	21
1	i bought 2 sets of these chairs and the matching table i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived they are quite substantial without being heavy and their appearance is quite nice the chairs came with no assembly and the table was very easy to put together with the provided allen wrench the feet on the chairs are adjustable so that you can get rid of the iritation of off balanced legs overall this was an incredible value at approximately 650 for the set i was so impressed by the quality and price that i have since ordered the matching bench	21
1	as an interior designer i was very pleased with the quality of these patio chairs i liked everything about them even the cushions were thick and comfy enough for even the heaviest of my guests i have other sunbrella cushions that are way to thin to be comfortable throughout a meal these cushions let you sit and eat for hours	21
1	i am no pro at grilling but this grill makes it all so easy ! it was easy to put together easy to use and easy to clean up everything i toss on it turns about perfectly grilled and absolutely yummy ! there are cheaper charcoal grills out there but if you 're a petite woman like me who does n't grill for a living it is well worth the extra money for the little conveniences of this grill i got the 18 1 2 inch grill and it has plenty of room for preparing dinner for 4 6 adults since putting my grill together i have cooked out every weekend	21
1	i do n't own one yet but i am buying one this week ! although i am a diehard amazon customer i am not buying it here cause lowes regular price is half what it is here my friend has owned his for a couple of years loves it i have had some food from it it was so moist flavorful i 'd recommend it but i would probably check around to see if it 's cheaper in your area	21
1	been using the bar388hga bk for about a month now appears to be very accurate for both temp and humidity really helps in calibrating our whole house humidifier \( who 's hygrometer is way off \) automatic atomic clock is cool too highly recommend	21
1	for the price you get the same as other units selling for double or triple the price the most important feature for me was exterior temp and humidity plus the unobtrusive design of the unit all functions are easy to read on the display could not be happier with this purchase !	21
1	we bought two of these we were very impressed how easy the set up was since installing the weather station we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures one feature of this weather station is a ice alert up here in north we do get freezing rain ice and snow this station has been right on thebutton with those predictions i would highly recommend the purchase	21
1	bought this for my apartment have two remote sensors one in the bedroom and one between a window and the outside screen for outside temps works flawless and gives the same temp outside as it shows up on the weather channel ! humidity reading is great too as its led me to buy a humidifier for the dry months all in all a good product	21
1	this thermometer and hydrometer is not only attractive but works beautifully i was given one as a gift and later bought one to give as a gift	21
1	this is in excellant condition and came in a timely manner	21
1	i sent this to my in laws foy christmas and they loved it ! ! they recently added a backyard garden and they are thrilled to have it and love how it looks i am told it is quite comfortable as well	21
1	this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive the color is elegant i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to and i have 10 dogs that love a couch ! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam	21
1	i thought the bench was a very good buy for the money it fits perfectly on a small area of our deck	21
1	i needed a nice bench for the entry but did n't want to settle for the same old bench like everyone else has so i stumbled upon this one and i love it ! ! ! ! it 's well made and the cushion is very plush ! the colors are perfect ! love it ! if you are looking for a nice and classy bench this is it	21
1	bought this item as gift for my mom and she loves it shipping took a little longer then expected but this was due to local shipping company not amazon wonderful addition to her backyard	21
1	prompt delivery packaged well and the best part no assembly required the finish is a brown tone cast aluminum it 's very well made it looks terrific with my matching fire pit table at some point i want to get the matching chairs beautiful set	21
1	i have always wanted a turkey fryer but they was to spendy and at this price i had to get it although i was a litte reluctant buying it off the internet then i received it not only was i happy with it i was also relieved that i didnt get ripped off with another internet scam \( thats why i ordered through amazon so i would be safe from fraud \) anyway i havent yet fried my turkey but i know that they will taste great ! ! ! ! !	21
1	this is a very nice mitt although not as good as another one i have which is a bit heavier still a good buy though	21
1	i bought these because i'm always burning my arms when i remove bread from my oven these gloves cover my arms to the elbow and are flexible enough to allow me to handle bread pans easily the price is outstanding i saw the same thing at one of the chain home stores for 7 99 each	21
1	we gave these out for halloween treats at the lake this weekend they were a big hit ! ! ! who does n't like glow sticks huh \? shipping was 6 99 for me so they were about 11 cents each great deal ! we were short 5 7 connectors for each 100 bracelets but perhaps we dropped them there were a lot of beverages involved \)	21
1	i purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser \( selling at football games \) it came out to about 06 cents per piece what several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace \( there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that \) the combined price of 18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at oriental trading \( 1 00 each \) and you ca n't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace would recommend these for kids birthday parties fundraiser church parties etc	21
1	these glowsticks are really great they are the perfect fund raisers the colours are vibrant and they do last for hours i have odrered and used these many times and they are my biggest sellers at carnival \( mardi gras \) time some of the connectors in the last shipment however tended to crack after a while those came with the sticks in the blue 50pc packs those that came with the yellow 100pc packs in my previous orders were perfect ! all in all this is a very good deal kids and adults alike are attracted to these bracelets you will make quite a profit with them	21
1	this is a great deal this is a great price great glow and quick delivery i highly recommend this product	21
1	i am a happy shopper great value and fun way to quickly spruce up the yard bought this for my mother in law and after visiting her house i had to have a few for myself they hang from tree branches water spouts and lamp posts i have even been able to hook the chains together to make them longer i thought they would have a hole in the bottom for the water to drain from but i guess they are suppose to fill and slightly tip so the water overflows over the edge that works as well so far they have not changed color or rusted	21
1	this mosquito catcher really works it was in the fall that i purchased this item and it has been running non stop since the winter here in central virginia has been so mild that mosquitos are still alive you may wonder if it really works and open the tray only to see about ten or more mosquitos fly out it also has caught yellow jackets \( bees \) and small moths great product i'm thinking of buying another one in the spring	21
1	cheap and it works is really an understatement ! item is quality made just plug in and empty drawer every day or so no bait or bags to buy i ran this the last weeks of summer and could not believe the amount of dead mosquitos in the drawer i highly recommend this item	21
1	the best sprouter i 've found does a great job of growing sprouts but very overpriced for its cheap quailty and build	21
1	i love this clock i wanted a small clock for my bedroom and did n't realize it projected when i bought it \( was an impluse purchase when buying a dvd player \) i ca n't live without it now i am nearsighted so this is great in the dark i have given four as gifts \( that 's what i'm buying today \) and i find that when i go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling ! i will always have a projection clock from now on i could n't live without it	21
1	bought this at my son 's request he used this for alarm clock and reading time in the dark he has near sightedness and the wall projection is just what he needs	21
1	this tiny alarm clock is really cool you have to read the manual and adjust how big and bright you want the projection on the ceiling you can also adjust how loud and different patterns you want the alarm sound it tells the temperature also i liked it so much i bought my mom one	21
1	i recently purchased the round tables for my classroom they are wonderful and allow several of my students and me to sit around them all at the same time they are also extremely lightweight allowing me to move them when an activity requires extra floor space	21
1	i'm sure i 'll eventually love this new weber ss grill but it seems to take considerable time to get the grill properly seasoned so the burners give off sufficient heat to cook evenly of course it 's been winter since i received the grill making it difficult to exercise ample outdoor cooking to thoroughly test enjoy the grill	21
1	nice build quailty works well in sub zero temps surprised two fold easy assembly and made in china !	21
1	i love how well it works it heats up nicely does its job and i am satisfied my only problem is the igniter it stopped working and i replaced it even then it still does n't seem to engage when i press the button i do n't get it i'm confused help a brotha out for now i am using one of those long neck lighters \(	21
1	the best thing about this grill is that it has two swing up surfaces for holding your platters or foods to be prepared a great work surface easy cleaning and no cold spots within the cook area make this top of the line looks great too	21
1	you ca n't go wrong buying this great grill it was a snap to put together with easy to follow instructions it heats up super fast and cooks with wonderful efficency no cold spots as far as i can tell so far on any parts of the cooking surface and flame ups are kept to a minimum you wo n't be dissapointed if you bring this baby home	21
1	this is just what you need for those hard to reach places today 's houses are built with such high walls and windows that you need to have this in your home	21
1	i love having a sun tan and thus have had a variety of beach lawn lounge chairs over the years this on is by far the most comfortable and best built i recommend it highly	21
1	i got one of these loungers as a gift this past christmas as soon as i put it on the deck everyone wanted to use this chair so i got online and found another so we can share it is more comfortable than any chair in our house	21
1	we bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale after longing for the full priced versions at stores we love these chairs but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them one of the chairs broke recently b c of the cords fraying over time the good news is that i easily ordered replacement cords online by just searching on google for lafuma replacement cords and for 19 i will have a like new chair again \( rather than replacing the chair for 150 \) so for those of you worried about the durability feature of the cording worry no more	21
1	this smoker provides an inexpensive way to get into real barbecue i find that it runs on the hot side with a full load of charcoal so it 's better for ribs than something like brisket or a pork shoulder still what i 've made so far is miles ahead of trying to smoke on a weber kettle grill	21
1	after searching many stores and websites i found the brinkmann smoker on amazon for a great price the smoker was delivered timely and undamaged not to mention how easy it is to cook with	21
1	the firepit was exactly as described and of good quality arrived faster than promised a quality item to get and enjoy an evening with the family roasting marshmellows	21
1	bought this as a gift for my husband he says it 's great for bbqing over oak wood i like the way the light shines thru the cut outs	21
1	this is a great fire pit for the money it is deep and secure no fear of the fire getting loose it also doubles as a bbq great buy for the money	21
1	we enjoy this firepit because it is unique and also doubles as a grill it is nice quality for the	21
1	shopped a long time for this one wanted more pit than the copper bowls had to offer plus came with grill cover and handy fire tool nice deal easy to assemble	21
1	this firepit is the perfect size for a small patio its sturdy construction will hold up to many summers gathered around the fire the glow is enhanced by the moon and stars cut outs making for a special evening event	21
1	i'm so excited to use this table the weather has been rainy ever since i got it it assembled beautifully comes w it 's own little tool it 's a nice strong sturdy table but it 's not overly heavy i was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w o any help it 's going to get a lot of use this summer	21
1	i love it i am a 55 year old woman in pretty good shape and i was able to get it out of the box and assembled completely by myself it arrived very very quickly my only complaint is that the bottle of touch up for the aluminum finish which came with it was not securely closed and leaked out so that when i opened the box i could smell the strong odor of solvent everywhere and the bottle was empty	21
1	this is our first fire pit and it seems to work great it is not too heavy so it can be moved around our patio and it looks nice the only downside and i think this is true of all firepits is that the bowl fills up with water when it rains and makes quite a mess in there i find myself cleaning the bowl more often than i 'd like but otherwise is a great	21
1	this table is quite attractive and substantial it sits a little lower than a standard patio table however one can still sit comforatbly near the table i suspect this is to prevent one from getting their legs under the table and too close to the fire pit bowl one negative two of the screws where the legs attach to the ring assembly did not fit well and were exteremly difficult to tighten all the way i almost was forced to cut the screws shorter i added some machine oil to the threads and gently worked the screws deeper into screw holes overall satisfied with the table and it is quite attractive	21
1	short of having an extra limb the hinged grate allows for roasting grilling with much less heat loss the extra control of the heat source allows for a better cooked product this steak is b tching was a quote from the gameday crowd at jack kent cook stadium at fedex field in maryland i will continue to pimp my grill with more accessories for next season	21
1	my husband is now able to slow cook food on the grill now that he can add charcoal to the bbq as needed if you have a weber get this	21
1	pre seasoned would be easier but twice the price too to avoid a smoke filled house you can season on the grill but make sure you can control the temp too much heat and you cook all the seasoning off as far as performance it does everything a big heavy pot is supposed to do the basket is funtional for deep frying but not steaming nice piece of cookware	21
1	this is one heavy duty cast iron pot ! very heavyweight the lid holds a good seal to the pot my only wish is that it came preseasoned i sure made a smoke filled room occur and of course once was not enough to season so i had to do it again but overall great pot	21
1	item was just as described ordered on 12 24 06 received item on 12 28 06 shipping and product awesome	21
1	this is a wonderful dutch oven i hemed and hawed between the more pricey lodge logic \( which my other cast iron pans are \) and this bayou classis thrift won out and i bought this one i am not disappointed in any way it was easy to season and makes an unbeatable pot roast	21
1	i had used a friend 's hammock chair before buying my own but his was made of very thin synthetic threads that catch quite easily on buttons etc not so with the charleston ! the cotton rope that makes up the weave is very comfortable to sit in all on its own or with the chair cushion that is provided and if it happens to catch on something it 's no big deal all i have to monitor with the kids is how far they swing i love it my wife loves it my kids love it ca n't wait to take it camping this summer \( though i may never leave the chair someone else has fire duty from now on \)	21
1	i have had to replace the igniter twice in almost 15 years the igniter was actually still quite good it is very well made as are most weber products the stainless steel gas box is what eventually fails due to rusting \( yep stainless steel will rust especially if subjected to heat \) it is easy to replace and i end up giving the entire grill a cleaning and tuneup	21
1	ca n't say too much for a replacement ignitor system but it works it installed as easily as expected and appeared to be of a slightly better quality than the part that it replaced if the previous part is any indication it should last about 5 7 years hard to believe in this time of designed obsolesence	21
1	my grill is n't a webber but i was still able to get it installed by cutting the top of the metal covering the electrode to make room for the burners lights the grill everytime	21
1	very simple to install if you need a new starter however after installing a new starter new burner tubes and new flavorizer bars \( all easy \) i discovered that something was wrong with one of the valves in my manifold i recommend this kit highly if you need a new starter but make sure you actually need one first turn the gas on and spray windex \( easier than soapy water \) over everything that might be leaking	21
1	i just rebuilt the genesis i it didnt need the igniter as it lit on the first clickevery time anyway but changed it as it was 7 years old orso also changed the flavorizor bars as they were aboutworn away	21
1	i have had a weber silver b grill for several years i have found that the igniter works for about two years then just does has to be replaced this is an easy replacement and is not expensive this ignighter works as well as any i have seen and i think the minor cost and inconvenience of replacing the ignighter is offset by the quality of the grill	21
1	this product arrived in a timely fashion and fit the grill perfectly	21
1	very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my weber spirit 500 grill took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button no more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy cold day	21
1	i sent this to my in laws foy christmas and they loved it ! ! they recently added a backyard garden and they are thrilled to have it and love how it looks i am told it is quite comfortable as well	21
1	the bench is comfortable and has enough weight so the wind does not blow it over the cushion is real nice and it dries quickly plus it fastens to the bench with only two small velcro straps two people can sit on the bench in comfort	21
1	this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive the color is elegant i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to and i have 10 dogs that love a couch ! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam	21
1	this bench is fabulous and the cushions are a very good quality we purchased the entire collection and could not be any happier they were boxed superbly so there was no damage at all and the quality is amazing obviously we love this product !	21
1	i thought the bench was a very good buy for the money it fits perfectly on a small area of our deck	21
1	i needed a nice bench for the entry but did n't want to settle for the same old bench like everyone else has so i stumbled upon this one and i love it ! ! ! ! it 's well made and the cushion is very plush ! the colors are perfect ! love it ! if you are looking for a nice and classy bench this is it	21
1	prompt delivery packaged well and the best part no assembly required the finish is a brown tone cast aluminum it 's very well made it looks terrific with my matching fire pit table at some point i want to get the matching chairs beautiful set	21
1	the pump works well certainly as good as can be expected for the excellent price ! it does however leave at least an inch of oil in the bottom of the pot the instructions say that this last bit of oil is too dirty and it is best discarded in reality the design of the pump just does n't allow it to suck oil up from that low a level i was however able to sufficiently filter most of these last few cups of oil using the pump and a large mouth jar when poured into a jar with a much smaller diameter the oil is deep enough that the pump can get to it leaving only a small amount that i did n't mind discarding	21
1	a very nice thermometer very simple to use to read and pretty accurate for a thermometer of this price at least it is more accurate than the local weather company made in china try to do n't drop it something that could be kind of annoying is that every 3 seconds the lcd will display the hour and after those 3 seconds will display the temperature if it does n't botter you \( like me \) you should buy it i tested it in temperatures from 15 c to 25 c and works fine 1 year warranty in the us and canada	21
1	i hate to admit but we have roaches ! actually we had roaches until last week when i purchased this product i had tried everything sprays bombs traps etc but nothing worked the first day i plugged this little device in there was such a great increase in bug activity that my kids would n't go into the kitchen by day 3 the roaches were gone ! i do n't know where they went and i do n't care this device saved my sanity	21
1	we love this product it was easy to set up and it 's great knowing what time it is without having to turn a light on the only thing i do n't like is the alarm it 's very annoying	21
1	i like oregon scientific products but their previous atomic alarms had quirky controls often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm this one 's lots better ! the projection feature works ok though does n't really focus sharply at the close distances i 'd prefer to use the eight minute snooze alarm is great just the right interval ! overall a nice useful moderately expensive alarm clock	21
1	this was the ideal instrument for us we like to walk in the early morning when the temperature outside is above 40 degrees ! the projected time and temperature tell us whether we need to get out of bed or can sleep in a little longer the weather forecasting feature is also useful and at least as accurate as the tv forecasts	21
1	love the large illuminated time temp on the ceiling setting up the external temperature sensor was a bit tricky you 'll need to make sure you have a glasses size screwdriver which i did n't have readily available otherwise everything worked as promised i am still not positive if the atomic sensor is working the instructions said you have to be something like 750 miles \( or was it 1000 \) away from the location in denver etc i am in detroit so the signal never seemed to sync up but it may have i am not sure all in all a great purchase	21
1	a nifty widget of the highest order it projects on the ceiling automatically corrected time and outdoor temperature in addition it tells indoor temperature and weather predictions at least as good as the local weatherman most alarms enrage when awakening this one is very pleasant but persistent if necessary the instruction manual seems like it was written by someone that had a taxi waiting but you can stumble through to the correct setting in time i am very happy with this item	21
1	i have purchased three of these benches and will be getting two more they are beautiful to look at and extremely comfortable they are well engineered and assemble in less than 15 minutes i ca n't comment on how they weather as i 've just received them but being cedar they should do well i was disappoiinted with the american woods accessory side tables they do n't have the sturdy and well built look that the benches have i purchased two will keep them but not get any more stay tuned i just bought the glider and will write a review after i receive it	21
1	i bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area it creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports the cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles the sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm	21
1	since i have started using this unit i have cooked my best thanksgiving turkey my best christmas ham and my best new year 's pork roast ever the only reason it 's not 5 star is that i 've needed the booklet almost every time i 've used it the controls are n't difficult but they are n't really intuitive either i 'd go 4 1 2 stars if i had the option	21
1	we were reluctant to buy this product because of some bad reviews we read about it but we are really glad we decided to buy it ! so far we have not seen one single bug or rodent or spider around ! and believe me we live in a mountainy area so we used to see them around all the time in our garage i have not seen them ever since we bought this product it is working for us	21
1	if you like thai cooking you will want to buy this tree	21
1	i was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when i sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what i needed and wanted to cancel the order he very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and i was impressed with this service gayla tregr	21
1	unfortunately i wanted a spatula and wok to use in the house not outside therefore i just recently returned it but it was great !	21
1	we had bought one of these for this house loved it so much we bought one for the other house too the original one was bought w the 22 wok which is gorgeous we use both w woks and it 's kewl easy to break down for travel too only thing was i shoulda bought the cover for the 22 wok while they were available ca n't seem to get one now	21
1	this is the best outdoor cooking item i have ever used it has very high btu 's and cooks very quickly when using it as a wok it takes the grease out of the kitchen that used to linger for days we cook all greasy foods outdoors it is extremely fast and the food comes excellent we use it more than out bbq	21
1	wow ! this burner really rocks it sounds like a jet engine when you crank it up high it really kicks out the heat i have had it for 2 days now and used it both nights for dinner brought a very large pot of corn to boil in no time but still had the control to steam crab legs without boiling the water dry very impressed with the range of flame control the grid reverses from a bowl shape for woks to a flat side for pots and pans really nice i could not be happier	21
1	i have an electric range and a propane bar b q this burner has been very useful and was the least costly alternative to accomplishing what i wanted to do i make 10 qts of salsa wo heating up the kitchen a turkey roaster i bought as an accessory really works well with the burner my cousin likes to fry potatoes and chicken wings this burner can really put out the heat	21
1	i set the buner in the backyard fire it up the jet engine equivalence heats up extremely quick and i finished sauteeding meat vegie in no time and they taste great full of favor all i need to do now is building a outdoor kitchen so i do n't have to keep moving all the ingredients in and out of the house	21
1	just from looking at the picture i can tell that this chair is made from redwood and is constructed with quot mortice and tennon quot joints a very solid method of construction my only hesitation is that there are no measurements given plus if the chair and chair back slats are n't thick enough they will be prone to spliting	21
1	i keep seeing this companies outdoor furniture am tempted to buy but wish someone who 's purchased some would post on how it weathers my porch is uncovered so weathering could be a problem thanks	21
1	amazon service and weber quality ! replaced a few parts on my weber grill to extend its life moved up to the stainless steel flavor bars and they are terrific looking for them to last more than the 15 years my porcilin flavor bars did with the same great grilling experience my weber grill is up for more than another 15 years of great grilling	21
1	stainless steel bars will last longer than plain enamel metal bars which lasted a ling time in all kinds of weather since we leave our weber grill outside all year cookung results seem to be the same	21
1	item arrived very soon after ordering using the free shipping option product is of very good quality manufactured by weber not a look alike manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of	21
1	this upgrade is worth every penny i agree with the reviewer that felt that heating was more even i would add that they seem to burn the drippings off better and keep the inside of the grill cleaner there is no doubt in my mind that the addition of this product makes the original design all the better	21
1	the cooker is very versitile we used it in the last week for a fish fry and then a low country boil the product works fantastic	21
1	this cooking set was on sale and even with shipping beat the best prices locally i gave it to my son as a gift and he was thrilled to get it it included the pots lids lifter that were also good quality very nice set good quality good value	21
1	i have used the fryer for chicken wings which is what i bought it for because i have plenty of parties throughout the year along with the professional look of the product it performs great ! if i could give it 10 stars i would it is the best fryer i have ever used and that says alot i would recommend this fryer to anyone looking to enhance their outdoor cooking and bring it to that next level	21
1	i got my chia herb garden about a month and a half ago and making them grow has been very easy and pleasant they are still tiny but they are doing good my advice is to follow the instructions carefully frequent watering trimming full sun or artificial light as explained in the instructions and plant food not only they can be used in cooking they are very decorative and cute	21
1	i received the chia herb garden about 3 years ago and not only was it easy to start but most of the plants are still going strong i have more chives and parsley than i know what to do with these are also some of the tastiest herbs that i 've ever eaten	21
1	i received this as a christmas gift last year i followed the instructions in january and by march the sprouts flourished into plants by summer i had repotted all of them twice and they are now huge my friends are always shocked at the growth of my basil tree as they call it i owe my success to south facing windows and religious watering \( infused with drops of plant food \) i do n't have a green thumb at all in fact i'm a known plant killer but i was able to get the chia herb garden to grow like a charm	21
1	this is compact and fairly accurate i use it inside my bedroom to check humidity levels and it is quite helpful would recommend ti to anyon	21
1	i wanted this since i did n't trust the humidity reading on my humidifier has large and convienent display due to its size and battery power i can easily move it around the house to check temp humidity in different rooms	21
1	very satisfied with the performance of this meter have been looking for a relative humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable the temperature is also included which is great price is very good for what you get ! !	21
1	this comfort meter works very good the shipment came in time for a gift for christmas one for us one for gift	21
1	i bought two different atomic clock weather from this company both with outside monitors it works just as it is supposed to one puts the time on the ceiling and the other does n't they both read both the outside monitors like a charm some of the buttons are a bit confusing in the dark once i set the alarm by mistake and at 2am i just had to put the thing in another room i could not find the off button	21
1	really like this weather station it seems very accurate in temperature and humidity readings both indoor and outdoor finding the proper batteries for the outdoor unit was a hassel in this area shipping was fast and am very pleased	21
1	i have owned this clock for 3 yrs now and just love it the numbers are easy to read and set up was a breeze i 've changed the batteries only once during this time very accurate on the in door and out door temperatures i definately recommend this clock	21
1	this items is just great as we get older we need number that we can see from our recliners	21
1	i owned the ws 8248u for a couple years and really like it that i decided to buy two ws 8236u for my two other bedrooms setup is easy i do n't have to manually correct the time for daylight saving time anymore the time is correct down the second really love it	21
1	picked up the time signal within five minutes set your time zone and you 're in business no more guessing if you have the correct time no more resetting twice a year for dst large display characters are easy to read neutral design fits with most any decor i would have preferred the moon phase colors to be reversed a full black circle is actually a full moon	21
1	despite the fact that this clock hangs in my basement rec room in cincinnati it has had no problem receiving the time signal from colorado it should be noted though that as the manual mentions the proximity of a powered up tv or computer monitor can interfere with reception of the signal as an owner of some expensive acoustic guitars i find the hydrometer readout very useful for monitoring room humidity and the readout is big enough to be easily visible from across the room i only wish this thing looked a little less purely utilitarian big and clunky two tone silver it adds nothing to my room aesthetically	21
1	this was such a hit at christmas for my son great gift idea and fast shippin	21
1	the la crosse weather station has excellent looks and works well however the outside temperate regulary drops out especially in cold weather overall i'm happy with the form and satisfied with the function	21
1	this hatteras hammock makes a great fall gift a dream comes ture for you as you find yourself setting under a porch watching the leafs fall off the trees is a picture coming true as you set in the hammock	21
1	this item was the perfect addition to the tool box grill that was bought as a gift for my son he loves i	21
1	this is one of the best grill brushes i 've ever used and i 've used a lot of them	21
1	the product \( 5 brushes \) was delivered in a timely fashion and it is a great product heavy duty which i need	21
1	what a pleasure to put together ! ! it took me 1hr to assemble all the parts were there and i dide n't need assistance just leaned it against the wrought iron rail of the patio and presto ! ! i was enjoing a fire in no time !	21
1	delivered as advertised good strong quality material covered my weber like a glove difficult to find a cover that was not black so i was delighted to find a quality alternative no complaints	21
1	living in florida we grill almost daily i seem to burn out a set of enamel grates every 15 months or so hopefully the stainless grates will last much longer without a doubt the best price for the grates in store or online was at amazon ! !	21
1	what is bad to say about these great grates \? uniform heat easier cleaning than the cheaper porcelain grates and a great replacement upgrade for my 4 year old weber with these and new flavorizer bars i plan on many more years of use for this grill my only wish is that they were a little cheaper on amazon price did n't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal	21
1	after having a porcelain grate that rusts even though i cover my grill i decided to upgrade when replacing after seasoning \( cooking on it 1 2 dozen times \) the grate performed great no sticking no rust cleans up well	21
1	these are a big improvement over the porcelin ones the food seemed to cook faster and tasted better they were heavier than i thought they would be and was a perfect fit for my silver b	21
1	the replacement grates were as promised and a worthy investment i was impressed with the speed i received them	21
1	receive the item very quickly eventhough i selected the free shipping method product is manufactured by weber in the original carton not a look alike item manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of before	21
1	with new stainless flavorizer bars and new stainless steel cooking grates i plan on many more years of use for this grill my only wish is that they were a little cheaper on amazon price did n't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal	21
1	i have had a weber silver b grill for several years the grill is great but the steel flavorizor bars rust and have to be replaced \( i replaced my bars twice in five years \) i have just started using the ss bars but i am sure they will be better than the old bars and well worth the extra initial cost if i had been able to get the ss bars earlier \( not usually available from local markets \) i probably would not have had to replace the bars as i did \( twice \) i highly recommend spending the extra dollars for ss bars when the originals fall apart	21
1	what a difference flare ups are goneperfect fit in gril	21
1	after having my silver b for 7 years the origional porcelin bars were very rusty my grill would flare up terribly i thought it might be from the rust holding the drippings and grease and making the flares worse i was right ! these stainless units \( the length is listed wrong here \) are great ! i just cooked brauts without a flare up ! price was great thanks amazon	21
1	purchased for the weber genesis silver a it is a genuine weber replacement part fits and operates perfectly easy installation and cheaper than buying from weber directly	21
1	i'm not sure quite what to say about the burners as expected they work extremely well and they were rather easy to install the only problem i had was with a bolt that had rusted and required a little time to get off beyond that i had my grill lit within 15 minutes of taking the burners out of the box	21
1	grill burner replacement was easy to install the directions where usefu	21
1	i purchased this prep station for my yard it is the nicest prep table i have seen for the price it is durable while still nice looking delivery was on time i did have a problem that some parts were missing from the box but they were replaced free of charge from the merchant	21
1	it is a great product for the price the prep station has a good storage capacity and is easy to move around our deck because of the wheels it was easy to put together too	21
1	this is an excellent product sturdier than most and very comfortable i like the back straps for carrying purposes would be nicer if it would recline fully	21
1	i 've had this for about a year and still have n't used it but it 's the having it that counts ! it looks like it will work well should the occasion ever arise	21
1	this is an excellent value for the price the assembly was easy and the storage room exceeds expectations	21
1	we have had this for along time now it works great it has n't rusted or needed parts or repairs if you are thinking about getting one but are concerned about the price just buy this one the better product	21
1	high quality well constructed cooker delivery was quick we are very pleased with our purchase	21
1	we bought two of these for a large party and have used them 3x times since they are easy to clean and are great for frying and seafood boils ! !	21
1	i purchased this product mainly for steaming blue crabs which throughout the summer we trap in the river in front of our house for years i have steamed them in a pot on the stove and the steam and odor filled the house using this pot outside provided a welcome relief with the added benefit of being much easier to clean than the enamel steamer i used on the stove it is very easy to use and it is just the right size for an average haul of crabs i have never fried a turkey but i just might try it	21
1	i ordered this product a few weeks ago and have used it twice now this is definitely a quality product i used to have an aluminum turkey fry kit and it was much more difficult to clean and did n't have this kind of quality feel to it i would recommend this product to my friends	21
1	nice stand paint has faded a bit after a year being stored outside exposed to the elements but is n't peeling or exposing any metal there are 3 segments they all fit together easily and are reinforced to prevent breakage or bending but they 're freely attached so if you need to move your hammock stand you 'll need 2 people unless you push it if you pull it one of the angled arms will slide out of the horizontal bar you could probably fix this yourself by drilling a hole through the bottom \( horizontal \) bar and into one of the arms to screw in a bolt but the steel is very thick about 3 16 quot or 1 4 quot thick	21
1	this stand assembles easily and is perfect for large hammocks do n't forget to get hooks and chains when you buy a hammock to fit this stand	21
1	i found the 16 lacrosse atomic clock to be exactly as described the metal case is sturdy and good looking the directions very straight forward 16 is big be sure you want this diameter they make smaller units i am quite satisfied with my purchase	21
1	the back panel broke when taking it out of package that is the packaging though not the clock it is in working order and keeps one 'on time'	21
1	so it 's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out right \? well yes it is as i get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming the fact that i can have one device that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me it 's just a clock but it works which is more than i can say for my fax or copier or phone or i always get lacross because i like the looks of their stuff be good to yourself upgrade to atomic	21
1	this clock is great it 's really modern looking and i love the black face i have this in my kitchen and it looks great there is a second hand which is invaluable in any kitchen the fact that it 's an atomic clock is super because it means that i never have to reset it for daylight savings time because it resets itself automatically shortly after you plug in the battery the clock starts setting itself to the atomic clock and that 's kind of fun keeps precise time	21
1	this is our 3rd addition to the lafuma xl model we also have 2 regular lafuma models this is the most comfortable chair and we camp every weekend and everyone fights over these chairs the xl model is great for my family because we are all 6ft tall or more and the width has more room too highly recommend	21
1	well made comfortable and attractive folds and opens easily only tall \( 6' \) or wide people need this size i'm 5'10 and the standard size fits me better	21
1	all you do is put in the batteries and wait about an hour and your clock is at the proper time forever ! no climbing to reset it at daylight savings	21
1	excellent service ontime delivery perfect match for my grill thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell	21
1	receive the item very quickly eventhough i selected the free shipping method product is manufactured by weber in the original carton not a look alike item manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of before	21
1	the new burner 's work great good as new ! only problem was removing old burners the screws that hold the ends in place were rusted in place i had to drill them out and replace the screws but all fine now much cheaper than buying new grill	21
1	i expected that the burner would work just fine i was surprised at how easily the burner was installed the old one came out effortlessly and the new one went in just as easy had i known it was going to be so easy i would have done it two years ago	21
1	the part was as advertised and easy to install i am very satisfied by the service and time to delive	21
1	excellent quality functional and flexible extra long handle lets me reach across the heat without getting burned the rubber grip was a nice touch and the replaceable brush heads are unique this comes with 3 brush heads and after those are used up you can get them for under 2 00 each this is a very solid well built tool that is built to last i highly recommend this	21
1	i paid 200 and free shipping for two chairsthey look like they are worth at least twice that amountglad i ordered them	21
1	worth more than the price tag beautiful and elegant you will be very pleased	21
1	i am thrilled with this purchase i had initially ordered 4 chairs and the companion dining table upon its delivery i went back and ordered another pair of chairs they are very comfortable generously proportioned their overall styling very beautiful to the eye i have subsequently received many compliments on this set i just wish they sold a larger matching table i plan on ordering the companion loveseat	21
1	this is great furniture folks many times i have thought that amazon hired people to rave in these reviews but i cannot say enough about how nice this furniture is ! i bought 4 chairs the settee and b c they do n't have a side table in the bainbridge pattern i bought the shaw table with the ice pit i have recommended these to everyone lol the price has gone up 10 every week for the past 2 weeks get em while their hot	21
1	these are just as good as i hoped no self assembly required very comfortable recommended	21
1	we are delighted with our new chairs and table the products were well packed and came in excellent condition the chairs are sturdy ample and comfortable even without the cushions the cushions that come with are very nice but too thick for my liking the chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces the table is big enough for a full dinner for four but small enough to still feel intimate we now spend a lot more time on our patio	21
1	as an interior designer i was very pleased with the quality of these patio chairs i liked everything about them even the cushions were thick and comfy enough for even the heaviest of my guests i have other sunbrella cushions that are way to thin to be comfortable throughout a meal these cushions let you sit and eat for hours	21
1	i am quite pleased with my lunchbox it is the perfect size yet is not obtrusive in design shape or capacity i would recommend to others	21
1	the bounty hunter iv metal detector is simple to use the owner 's manual was easy to follow we have used it at the beach and around our property we have n't found anything valuable yet but its fun to try	21
1	bought this for my wife she loves it perfect for a first time bounty hunters it works very well for anyone that does n't need all the professional features	21
1	i have n't tried this item yet as the weather has n't cooperated but the service was great i ordered it as a last minute christmas item and got it in time to make my recepient happy thank	21
1	this is a great device it fits with what i read about performing automatically a couple of things that beginners have trouble with in my case i had lost my wedding ring in the yard while raking leaves the long story resulted in a happy end when after wondering if the device really worked after an hour of frustration i tried a different area i knew that the ring could not possibly be and the device went off loud and clear and there the ring was ! i am quite happy that the automatic adjustments make it an excellent beginner metal detector	21
1	i bought this as a complete novice to the sport \? \? of metal detecting i bought it with the intention of locating a few property stakes and maybe finding some valuable treasures in my yard to date i have found neither i would chalk this up to my inexperiece and to the fact that i have not gotten out and used it nearly as much as i imagined i would everything i have read about this particular detector indicated it was an introductory model that works reasonably well i would agree	21
1	the person that i gave this gift to really enjoys and finds it easy to use	21
1	very very simple to use right out of the box this really seems like a good entry model and one that i can use for a long time i recommend getting headphones i got the sony mdr v150 monitor series headphones with reversible earcups and they work great	21
1	i m new at this metal detecting i have fun i just like finding something you get all excited what could it be money jewelry or what treasure hunting its kool the bounty hunter was easy to use simple to put together	21
1	i am satisfied with this item i bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and did not want to spend too much incase metal detecting was just a 'phase' ! it is easy to use and beeps at the first sign of metal ! we 've mostly dug up ring pulls from cans and a few cents here and there we 've had no problems with it he 's used it a number of times and the batteries show no sign of running out yet metal detecting is fun and this detector would make a great gift for 8 16 year olds or anyone just starting out their interset in metal detecting	21
1	i'm pretty happy with this detector it works really well i just wish i could turn the volume down the beep is ear piercing i started using headphones with it so now i have the pleasure of ear piercing beeps even closer to my ear drum this was purchased to help find a lost item in the backyard so it would have been nice to have the option of turning it down for the neighbors sake	21
1	i am very pleased with the bounty hunter fast track metal detector it is very light and easy to set up and use it is a great value at 84 00 dollars delivered the vinma	21
1	fast and good product	21
1	the bounty hunter is an excellent value for the person who loves to scour about an area that was lush with people ie \( company picnic family reunion \) the hunter is easy to use and is lightweight the instructions are clear and concise in describing the difference between a rusty nail and a piece of jewerly this is my first bounty hunter and i 've already recommended it to my friends	21
1	this is a very good working metal detector i 'd recamend it to anyone who is looking in to buy it	21
1	i gave this too my mother for christmas she loves it it is very light and easy to use just be sure to bring your shovel with you when you use it	21
1	hard solder beautiful looking unbelievably priced no assembly required pieces of furniture that seem to be sturdy enough for home use but not for someone weigthing 300lbs crashing on them i do n't weight 300lbs and i love them i got also two chaises \( read review \) the deep seating sofa 2 ottomans and a couple of side tables	21
1	i 've been looking for something like this for a long time this product has plenty of room in it for the tree that i have unfortunately it has no structure to it so it 's very flimsy and makes transporting the tree somewhat difficult the fact that you 've made something that replaces the original product packaging is very helpful though i 'll give you an a for the concept and a b for the product design	21
1	we 've used artificial christmas trees for years and every year we 've taken off the ornament etc and broken the tree down for storage this year we ordered the christmas tree bag this year we took off the stand and set the entire tree ornaments and all in the bag only about a foot of the trunk stuck out after zipping up where has this bag been all these years \? next year we 'll unzip put on the stand and set up the tree plug in the lights and away we go	21
1	i love the storage bag it was large enough for my 7 1 2ft tree i have n't had any problems with it it 's sturdy i did n't like the fact that the shipping and handling is almost as much as the storage bag	21
1	thermometer works fine holds up in extremes temps and conditions i wish it reached farther but when within range a nice satellit	21
1	i 've had one of these for years and bought them for gifts several times they work great	21
1	the sensor works very well however since it is an outdoor sensor it should be waterproof it is not it must be placed where the rain will not fall on it	21
1	i read some reviews that there were some compatability issues with this sensor and the main unit however i had no trouble at all getting this sensor to work with my existing unit and sensor once i realized i need to reset the main unit in order for it to recognize the newest sensor i have one sensor outside in my garage and the other downstairs in my basement and they both work well and are pretty accurate with the actual temperature this was an excellent purchase	21
1	this canvass like cover is very sturdy and i think it will stand the test of time a friend of mine saw it and i ordered one for her too ajustable size makes it a fit for several sizes of firepits	21
1	protects the pit well but is hard to tie tight on a 33 inch pit	21
1	cooks illustrated rated this product the best and so do i i purchased two as gifts one for my husband and one for my son in law for fathers day both are extreamly pleased with the product	21
1	first off the picture is all wrong the tools are just like the ones in the mr bar b q 5 piece oval stainless handle tool set except you also get the plastic case scraper 8 corn holders and 4 knives not the wooden ones shown in the picture it comes with the xxxl spatula and tongs i mean these thing are huge in every sense of the word its a nice set for the price i would have like a smaller spatula and tongs like the ones shown they are almost too big but i am sure this will last a long time the tools look quite durable good buy but just be aware what you are actually buying	21
1	i gave it as a gift to my son and he likes it	21
1	bought this as an open box what a great detector for the money i had it out of the box and up and running in 5 mins very easy setup ! ! took it to the back yard and found 3 pennies in the first 10 mins \( one was a wheat penny \) the lcd correctly displayed them as a pennies as this was my first time detecting the unit seems very easy to use an excellent choice for those wanting a feature filled detector at a bargin price	21
1	my grandfather bought the bounty hunter sharp shooter 2 metal detector for my daughters and my self they are 5 and 8 and love going to the beach to search for quot treasure quot	21
1	i purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind i will never buy a glass top patio table again this table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella looks like it all came together had to learn my lesson about glass i wish it was a couple inches bigger but it 's really just fine	21
1	i was really pleased with the quality of this patio table it was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering as others have commented the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table i ordered i had to buy additional screws at home depot four in total the missing instructions for the table ordered were not really needed it was simple enough to put together without instructions all tools needed were included with the shipment had i not needed to purchase additional screws i would have given this product 5 stars	21
1	extremely pleased ! we received the entire strathwood bainbridge collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product \( s \) ! ! the patio furniture is both beautiful and solid hope it will last for many years	21
1	fast delievery great price and quality we will enjoy it many years to come	21
1	i just received this table cover and am very pleased this is a high quality product the material is heavy and lined with waterproof rubber and the construction is superior with double sewn seams and heavy duty hand grips a much better product than i have seen for similar prices in local stores	21
1	i have an oval table that seats six the chairs are both stationary and swivel style this fits the set perfectly nice durable canvas fabric handles to pull to the sides straps to anchor cover to furniture set only negative is it has pull straps to tighten the cover along the bottom however the canvas does not move well enough to really pull it taut great value though	21
1	this probe does not work with the oregon scientific bar898hga wireless weather station you have to buy the thc268	21
1	this clock is very simple and clean i had no problem getting mine to work i had to leave it overnight to get the signal and they all set one has walls blocking the western direction and it sometimes loses the signal so i just leave it out overnight at a better location and put it back overall i really like this clock	21
1	i recieved the headphones this week and hooked them up to my fast tracker and went out into the yard looking for treasure they work great and i was very pleased with the quality of the product and the sound if you have a fast track metal detector you need to purchase this accessory it is made to adapt to all bounty fast track models the vinma	21
1	my husband and i got these headphones for his 9 year old son who lives in ocala florida he loves them they are n't too heavy and really allow him to listen carefully when a 9 year old can concentrate on something for longer than five minutes you know it 's a good product ! they took some getting used to but after three weeks he 's doing very well and does n't even notice that he has them on	21
1	very comfortable and easy to use very easy to fall asleep in just make sure to tie yourself to something	21
1	we love our water hammocks they are so easy to fold up and carry down to the beach and then so easy to inflate and deflate they are comfortable	21
1	this product is good food at good price the shipping package was poor cardboard containers were dented and leaking	21
1	i have had this for 1 month now and i love it it does record the outdoor and indoor temp you can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock we had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night \( also great ! \) and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time it is updated every 24 hours i love it	21
1	this is truly a high pressure very hot burner the amount of heat that this is capable of producing is nothing short of amazing if you want to heat or boil a large quantity of water or frying oil it is too hot for small pots this burner will do the job	21
1	this remote temperature sensor works in conjunction with the base unit and permits you to monitor the outdoor temp and humidity as well as the indoor temp anywhere in your house i keep the base unit in my bedroom and can then tell both the outdoor temp and the lower level indoor temps when getting dressed for the day i think the system works very well for a reasonable cost	21
1	fairly accurate but not precise also a replacement unit costs more than a completely new system oregon scientific has a very strange pricing model	21
1	i 've used this along with the base station for one year now i 've monitored temp and humidity inside outside and in my rv parked in my driveway works great easy to use easy to change the batteries despite the instructions you can use rechargable batteries they read low on the display but work just fine	21
1	besides that outdoor temperature and relative humidity i use the base station inside along with three remote wireless monitors to measure temperature and humidty in my crawlspace attic and outdoors to monitor possible water intrusion issues and if there are freezing temperature concerns for the pipes during cold weather periods	21
1	we already have the base unit for this product and have previously added another sensor which worked so well that we have now added a third sensor in addition we have bought the base unit as gifts and have now bought additional sensors for those that we bought the base unit for we like to be able to check the temperature in our motorhome especially during the winter as well as the garage attic etc my husband moves the sensors to other locations from time to time and has been very impressed with the whole system	21
1	i have two of these one in my bedroom and one outside they work great i also have one simular to this one except it has a 4 ft external temp sensing wire that can be used for a pool or freezer i use mine in a freezer in my shed 150 ft away all three send a signal back to a small base unit in my living room that i monitor daily i lost power to my shed last week if not for the temp sensor in the freezer reading 20 degrees i probably would have had a lot of food spoil if these sensors ever go bad i will get new units	21
1	i did a lot of research and if you follow directions it is safe and fun it takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb turkey the pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird the turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering watch the oil temp so it does not go over 350 do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells	21
1	we bought this for thanksgiving but found ourselves using it more often than just once a year easy to setup and great to use	21
1	i gave this grill thermometer to my dad for father 's day it works perfect when he wants to sear fish and steaks too it 's easy to remove from the grill too i would recommend this item to anyone who does a lot of searing or wants to know the surface temperature of their grill you can use this for a griddle or an indoor grill on your stove too	21
1	i 've had this unit for almost 3 years it works great i installed it per manufacturers recommendations i was careful with it to not damage it the software is great for communication via internet i have found the measurements to be very accurate i would buy this again i'm sure the competition has nice units too but i really like how this one works the rain guage works great what i 'd really like is a snow guage	21
1	this was the best price on the internet for this item it fit perfectly and solved the problem	21
1	my glass came broken so waiting on replacement thanks amazon for fixing my proble	21
1	i have been buying plastic hummingbird feeders that attach to the window so i can have an up close view of my favorite birds i found this wonderful glass feeder that will not deteriorate and get brittle \( i had to replace the plastic ones every year \) i was concerned that it would be too heavy but the suction cups are very effective and the feeder was accepted immediately by all the hummingbirds right now there is snow on the ground temperatures below freezing at night and i still have a faithful hummer visiting every day when it gets warm enough for him \( her \? \) to move around great product	21
1	my sister gave this to me at christmas and i kept it out on the counter all winter in hopes of an early spring ! ! ! i put all my feeders out the first of may and seen my first hummer the 2nd hope they will find this one on my window they are so neat to sit and watch make your own nectar to use in your feeder i use a funnel works great to fill feeders	21
1	lovely fast shipping no problems with fastenings or construction at all have ordered the bench 4 chairs too look forward to them all arriving being together on the deck 2 chairs have arrived so far they are great table even comes with touch up paint	21
1	i purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind i will never buy a glass top patio table again this table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella looks like it all came together had to learn my lesson about glass i wish it was a couple inches bigger but it 's really just fine	21
1	i was really pleased with the quality of this patio table it was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering as others have commented the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table i ordered i had to buy additional screws at home depot four in total the missing instructions for the table ordered were not really needed it was simple enough to put together without instructions all tools needed were included with the shipment had i not needed to purchase additional screws i would have given this product 5 stars	21
1	just received this and think it will turn out to be a great table bought the bench and matching chairs they are a great set	21
1	extremely pleased ! we received the entire strathwood bainbridge collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product \( s \) ! ! the patio furniture is both beautiful and solid hope it will last for many years	21
1	fast delievery great price and quality we will enjoy it many years to come	21
1	an amazing little grill with 8 charcoal briquettes i cooked a couple of salmon burgers on it for lunch then put on two cornish game hens put on the cover let them bake for an hour and had them later for dinner note don't peak under the lid when using this grill as an oven the heat escapes and it takes awhile to build it back up instead use your nose ears an excellent little grill for camping picnics and emergencies since it uses so little fuel you can do a great deal of cooking with a single bag of charcoal do n't use lighter fluid use a small starter stick to start the coals	21
1	used with my bounty hunter metal detector the 4 inch gold nugget search coil provides the resolution and sensitivity which should be expected with all good metal detector systems the 4 inch coil is a must for any serious user	21
1	this wonderful hammock continues to offer my family a much needed break from gardening raking or playing with the kids the kids love to pile in and spin until they are dizzy while i enjoy a much needed break and read a favorite book	21
1	we received one of these chairs as a gift from our daughter several years ago it has been a great conversation piece besides being a very comfortable chair the grandkids argue over who 's turn it is to use it it is very relaxing to sit in it on the patio on a nice summer evening and read or watch the sunset	21
1	one of the most comfy chairs i own just delightful to sit outside on the patio i love my chair in fact i 've got two i ca n't say anything more then these are beautiful relaxing comfy chairs	21
1	i have purchased lentek bite shield because it is the only product i was able to find that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents i am used to i needed it for my daughter 's bedroom so i could n't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and i did n't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin lentek bite shild seems to work pretty well she got bitten only once the night i forgot to turn it on now i plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet that way i would be sure that the batteries would n't die in the middle of the night	21
1	when the time zone change happened earlier this year the clock worked like a champ and adjusted accordingly with the atomic clock the outdoor thermometer seems to give good temperature readings however i would never ever rely on the barometer to tell me if it 's cloudy or sunny it 's often wrong i also like the light projected readings of the clock it 's too bad that you ca n't set the clock itself to be readable in the dark which i prefer sometimes over the projection	21
1	we absolutely love it it is truly amazing we only wish we had this clock a long time ago we have missed out on a lot of fun and convenience we have enjoyed this instrument so much that we ordered six more for each one of our children they have all reported back on how much they love theirs as well	21
1	i have owned one for the past 4 years \( have n't turned it off since the day i bought it \) and it 's still projecting strong as ever i bought one for my friend for christmas also and he loves it just as much as i do	21
1	i recently purchased this clock for our bedroom and it has been one of my favorites purchases i can read the clock during the day and night with no problem and the atomic clock set up within 2 minutes it was so easy i also like having the temputure show up i would recommend this to everyone looking for a projection clock	21
1	i bought this item as a gift for my dad i was unable to get the atomic clock to self set but we live just outside of a large city and i 've heard this can cause some issues in any event my dad loves the crescendo alarm feature \( as he gets up at 4 30 am \) and the projection feature everything else works fine and i would recommend this item perhaps if i played with the atomic clock a bit more i could get it to self set	21
1	this is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports it is easy to use and not too bulky wish is was made of a more durable material other than plastic but like i mentioned it is great for a beginner to practice it has all of the main functions of watches costing much more so it does the job it is a very clean and smart looking watch	21
1	great value sure case could be metal instead of polymer but for the price the capabilities of the watch ca n't be beat very intuitive interface and easy to use compares favorably to watches costing 3 4 times as much	21
1	it 's a good watch i'm happy with it it does the jobthe altimeter is not that accurate but that 's the case with almost all the barometric altimeters if u do n't mind putting in the correct altitude once in an wile is okthe rest is a o k	21
1	everyone who walks in to my room where i have this clock sitting comments on and wants to know where i got it this is one of my favorite things	21
1	i bought this to monitor the evening outdoor temperature when it finally cools off enough outside i turn the air conditioner off and run just the fan on fresh air this was simple to set up and seems to work flawlessly i like that a change in temperature registers very quickly in tenths of a degree	21
1	this does what you want it to accurately tells the temp indoor and outside and refreshes itself about every 30 seconds what more could you ask for \? theres also a blue backlight so you can press any button during the nightime it also functions as a clock with an alarm but i dont use it	21
1	i never know what to get my mother in law for her birthday my husband mentioned that she had a lot of hummmingbirds around her house so i got her this feeder she told me that all the hummingbirds now go to this feeder and not the others she was very pleased with it which made me very happy she 's a great mother in law	21
1	this is the only feeder that attracts hummingbirds to our door we had birds eating right at the glass slider on the front deck all summer long ! the birds loved it and my family did too	21
1	i am delighted with this product it is beautiful and reasonably priced	21
