0	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	0

1	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands these shoesare well made and an excellent value the only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case	0
0	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	0

0	broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars would n't recommend	0
0	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0

0	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	0

1	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years i'm always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear i'm back in them with thicker socks of course they can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other	0

1	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	0

1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	0

1	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	0

0	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	0
0	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up i personally would n't recommend this bra	0

1	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	0

0	bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment very poorly made only glued together not stiched up it already started to go apart you wo n't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one 's self when walking or working out it looks pretty but that is all	0
0	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	0
1	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	0
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
1	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	0
0	buying this was a mistake this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt the straps are not comfortable it 's cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded def not what i expected from this product the material and pattern is the only thing i liked it has a sexy look to it	0
0	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	0
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
1	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered i like it delivery is fast i will order something else	0
0	the photo is quite deceiving this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap shiny and is horrible to the touch my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit	0
1	fit well great for all kinds of athletic workouts i'm ready to buy a couple more pairs	0
1	i love these boots ! i got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect i can fit pants in them or over them and i have not had a problem yet	0

1	i was very pleased with the socks they were just what we were looking for ! thanks so much	0
1	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child	0
1	i just recieved my shoes today and ca n't believe that these shoes fit perfectly the wide size 8 5 is just what i needed i am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as i would often have with other shoes i love the value as i purchased these for only 19 79	0
0	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face however the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it it hasnt torn completely yet nevertheless i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon i wouldnt suggest this produc	0
1	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i ever owned excellent quality and fit	0
1	this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you 're dressed in a short sleeve over this one however i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company	0
1	speedy delivery product as stated would buy from them agai	0
0	i am a 38 ff and i was hoping this would help hold me in while running not ! this bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price ! i'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in ! this one is going back	0
0	have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems this time was different they sent the wrong shorts i paid the shipping to send them back i asked please send the right shorts they credited my account an amount smaller than i paid and that was that certainly not satisfied	0

0	i would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all the silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night	0
1	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers the last ones stayed with me for three years they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily heat up fast great lasting curl \( particularly for hard to curl fine hair \) and do n't even need to leave them in that long would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl	0

0	i wish there were 0 star although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them after searching a lot for buying a present for my sister 's birthday i found this sandal and i decided to buy i ordered it on march 9th and after 20 days ! ! still i have n't received them ! ! ! ! ! ! i am getting my money back not only i have wasted my time but also i should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late ! ! ! ! conclusion these sandals are very beautiful but never fall for them	0
0	i loved the bathing suit the first time i laid eyes on it so i purchased it i'm actually small but i do have thick thighs so i got a medium but when it was delivered and i tried it on it was too small ! i should have gotten a large the medium made me look like i had these big love handles so please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger but other than that the bathing suit is great i'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
0	did not fit well at all way too big around the ankles every step i took the boot would start to fall off they were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper	0

1	as a new 36dd \( ca n't wear underwire \) this is the most supportive and comfortable bra on the market for the past 5 years \( since my surgery \) i 've been searching for the perfect bra i have finally found it !	0
1	i liked the shoes they look nice my only concern when i first received them was the quality of the cover leather at the begining it looked like plastic but otherwise they fit perfectly	0
0	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs \( from another online company \) because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors i was sorely disappointed the colors are pretty but the material is crummy its rough flimsy and feels like plastic the pastel colors \( citron cool mint etc \) are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear the tops run quite large \( i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is very roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again \)	0
1	i purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months the shoes are very comfortable and look very professional love them strong and tough not to heavy has good grip on snow	0
1	these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather	0
1	comfy tough lightweight wrinkly \( like me \) surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is good stitching velcro back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like	0

1	this product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim \( so many types of luggage are similar in style and color we 've had trouble in the past \) several of our family members were given new luggage for christmas and these tags were included these tags are big bright lime green and can be easily seen no more headaches in trying to find our luggage	0
1	better than a photo album for showing off a series of pictures buttons are fairly intuitive instructions are understandable and there 's nothing like being the first kid on the block with a new toy getting all sorts of comments about my picture show	1
1	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras it fits in the pocket easily i'm satisfied	1
1	this is my first time to purchase a battery grip for a digital slr camera and it was a good investment i do n't have to worry about running out of battery power and at the same time it works as a vertical grip for my camera it also looks nice on my canon 30d camera coupled with an l series zoom lens	1

1	i purchased an off brand to use with my fxf 10 when this case was on back order it was terrrible so i ordered this case and am thoroughly pleased the camera fits perfectly into the case and although it is described as a soft case it is durable and will protect your camera with style without adding additional bulk	1
1	bought these binoculars for my husband he loves them they are very powerful and he loves the way they feel not too heavy he can look at stuff across the creek and is amazed at the clarity in the things that he sees	1
1	excellent clarity even on cloudy days i have had others that cost 4 times the price and would not match the quality of these comes complete with with case caps and neck strap	1
1	i purchased this camera brand new for a fraction of the price of my first digital camera this is my second point and shoot digital camera since i have abandoned film it is a very solid and durable and it takes beautiful pictures it has almost no shutter lag time and the battery has never run out on me i have used it on an entire week long vacation without re charging it kodak keeps making these cameras better and more reliable for less	1
1	i bought this for my new hdv fx1 camcorder and it works great unlike the century wide angle lens this is fully zoom through lens is 8x which is less than the century and others but just about right for hd since the fx1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out this just gives it an extra boost converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm also very little barrel distortion in all a great lens only drawback is that it 's a big \( heavy \) lens but then hey it 's for a serious prosumer camcorder	1
0	i would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera the picture quality was not good at all i previously owned another kodak camera with the same megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better just after a year of using the kodak c300 camera it stopped working and i did not use it that much i now own the sony cybershot dsc w50 that takes great pictures i have n't had any problems with it and i have been using it on an almost daily basis since may 2006	1
0	i would love to really rate this camera case but i have not received it yet we have been waiting for almost two months and still no case	1
1	this monopod does a great job for my camera you have the quick easy off it attatches to your camera by a screw and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly i wanted a nice inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense i have a canon 35mm and i recently purchased a 75 300 zoom lense for it and i needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot if i knew then what i know now i would buy it again nice product	1
1	it 's easy to use and makes good pictures easily a match for the disposable cameras that require you to turn the camera in and wait i also have a 1gb san card so i can shoot up to almost 1400 pictures as it is i shoot a couple and then load them into my laptop and send them to people via e mail	1
1	we just got this camera after much research the camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it does n't do some of what was advertised for the most part tho for the price and all it is fine just read all the directions and do n't be to disappointed if it does n't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that i wrote to sony and they said that this model does n't do a few things so main point here is read and read and know what it is i liked the service we received thru amazon no problems ther	1
0	i was looking for a pair of roof prism binoculars like this for hawk and bird watching i had looked at swarovskis but they were way out of my budget nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution these binoculars are crystal clear with sharp focus the 42mm lens lets in lots of light lots more than the 35 's i 've been using i wear glasses and the twist up and down eyecups are a blessing there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm nice because i always used to lose them for the price these ca n't be beat	1
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	1
0	i bought this camera for my 13 year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda it was ok felt sort of cheap but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to big drawback there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot so the danger of scratching the lens is immense my son was so afraid of scratching the lens that he barely used it some of the few pictures that he did take were ok but others were not of the best quality i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get and i'm surprised because i usually love samsung products	1
0	i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used the delay between pictures is incredibly long the lens shutter does n't open properly \( two other family members who own powershot a520 's are having the same problems	1

0	should have listened to the reviewer before me unit arrived dead neither ac power or car charger worked tried replacing the 4 batteries that came with it with my other known batteries and unit still did not work	1
0	poor focus blurry awful optics do n't waste your time with this one ! ca n't compare to the little pure digital camcorder that this device was to replace because of its additional features	1
0	very disappointed in this product and amazon 's response to the problem item clearly shows that a metal neck strap is included and until i complained that it was not included this was still written up as being part of the accessary back at time of complaint but since been changed they have told me they ca n't supply the missing part \( the metal neck strap showing in the photo \) as item comes from a freight forwarder i did not get what i paid for and unable to return because item has been forward shipped out of the country	1
0	i just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the c743 camera the battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger i think it 's odd as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock i'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery i do n't know whether the dock works okay because i did n't get that far this is my second easyshare camera and dock and i was very happy with the first one now i have to buy another battery	1

1	i bought this camera to replace a casio exilim ex s500 that was sadly stolen from me it 's the same size which i love and as convenient which is awesome it has a large bright screen to see the pictures you are taking or have taken it 's one of my favorite things ever	1
0	it worked fine the first week then the focus stopped working i sent it to repair it worked well for a couple of weeks and then the focus stopped working i sent it for repair for the second time it worked well for a couple of weeks and then stopped working also it is impossible to contact the repair center or the customer relation center at sony ! ! ! they make you wait over an hour ! ! ! si if you want a camera for two of three weeks this is probably what you are looking for ! ! ! sony repair reference number e3317596	1

1	with these weights i was able to send my canon powershot s70 to the bottom of the atlantic and i have great faith that they will keep it there reliable and more professional than a brick	1
0	i purchased 2 of these cameras and both of them came with a usb charging cradle that would not work this is terrible terrible quality control and i will never trust another casio product	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
0	the powershot a520 on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera	1
0	great camera for the price but i guess you get what you pay for bad warranty	1
0	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	1
0	almost useless ! tried it for several days of photo shoots and finally gave up in frustration went back to using the viewfinder without this magnifier professional medical photographer	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
1	this digital camera is awesome i have no problem with the batteries i made sure i put the good batteries in \( no cheap ones \) i looked at purchasing a canon and a hp but the features it had on this one was outstanding and for the price i purchased this camera with the 1gb card with it i ca n't wait to start using it when i go to san diego in march awesome digital camera you wo n't be sorry on this purchase	1
0	i ordered the original item used it for about a week then sent it to my son in new hampshire he used it less than fifteen minutes and it locked up never to function properly again i ordered a replacement checked it out and sent it on to him with the same result less than 15 minutes of use it quit working i thought the unit was nice compact and fairly easy to use but with two malfunctions in two cameras i do n't think i would recommend this aiptek model to anyone	1
1	this is a great bag it fits the camera perfectly and has room for all of the accessories as well i'm very pleased and was happy that amazon carries the item as we could not locate it anywhere else	1
1	started to by a less expensive bag last january \( dec now \) and i'm shure glad i did n't for the money this bag is a good one it 's not flimsy and you can get in and out of it and the pockets easly the tripod holder on top has been real convenient	1
0	i selected a sony vf 30cpkxs polarizing filter but it took me to this page where i got a sony vf r30nkx 30mm neutral density filter there is a big difference may 9 2006 i hope this is a mistake and not intentional deception	1
0	i agree with the people complaining about the poor cs policy at jvc they let me down as well when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built i am now using a different brand and will definitely avoid jvc in the future i just hate it when companies do not care about their customers but just about profit this will come back and bite them in the behind	1
0	this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap there are other cases available with better features for less money	1
1	this is the perfect camera for me i take alot of close up detail shots and the images come out great it is smaller than my old g3 \( which i loved but was pretty chunky \)	1
0	this product did n't appear to add any appreciable sound benefit the sound from the ecm hgz1 appears to be the same as that recorded with the native audio of the camera itself i wish i had not bought it	1
1	if you have the big lenses \( 400mm f 2 8l is usm or even the 70 200mm f 2 8l is usm \) this is totally worth the addition the 2x does not kill the autofocus on the f 2 8 and effectively doubles your lens with very little distortion around the edges check compatability on canon 's website you wo n't be disappointed	1
1	ok i do n't know who reviews batteries but this one is pretty good	1
1	nice portable background support kit stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution easy and quick to put up i put it up by myself with very little effort all rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting	1
0	this is a good charger quick and portable but the battery life of the battery sucks !	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
0	i have n't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives i have a fujifilm e550 camera which cost is usd 250 00 by this date this lens cost is usd 95 00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra usd 20 00 that means you will pay usd 365 00 for a 8x zoom camera for that price or less you can get a 10x slr like camera like the fujifilm s5100 or s5200	1
0	not worth the 10 i paid especially when i had to spend 7 to ship it ! !	1
1	this lens is amazing nothing escapes it it 's like a black hole clearly the best lens i have ever owned it 's like the lidless eye of sauron from the lord of the rings it is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera it comes with a beautiful case a hood and a tripod mount on the lens believe me you will need it i took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great i will now get to work reading the small manual it has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings wow !	1
1	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera which is bulky this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding inside pics were a bit pixelated but i may have had the settings wrong the camera is easy to use right out of the box perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case	1
1	i gave this as an xmas gift to my 14 yr old daughter and she loves it super easy to use good idea to get a backup battery if you 're like her and forget to charge it sometimes big selling bonus was that it was thin enough to fit into her pocket	1
0	for nearly 100 this adaptor provides very little \( 1 5x \) magnification it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor which is used infrequently by me but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance it is lightweight but cumbersome and does n't accept filters for real telephoto capabilities get an slr with interchangeable lenses i sent this product back	1
1	the changer performs perfectly i was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget the only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original about one foot shorter other than that it is fine i gave my original changer to my daughter whose charger died just before leaving the country	1
1	after using both lenses i think this is much better here are my reasons 1 f 2 8 makes the autofocus much faster and accurate 2 bokeh is much better in this one 3 macro is slightly better on this one 4 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size 5 is is not very crucial in 24 50 range	1
1	great product good value maybe a little slow for focusing compared to my old 18 55mm canon lens good quality pictures great all in one lens	1
1	the np bg1 type g lith pack had good picture life but i 'd carry a spare if your going to use your cameras movie feature	1
1	sony has done it again ! fast charging and long lasting this battery is perfect for my sony cyber shot camera !	1
1	though the lenses for my nikon d50 were not as expensive as some can be they still were several hundred dollars and having this uv protection filter protecting the lens glass made a whole lot of sense i feel less stress when i clean the filter lens than if i was wiping dust and dirt from the actual lens glass this size 52mm was what was specified for my d50 and it fits perfectly as it should i have no complaints at all with the manufacturer or the seller if you are new to digital slr 's like i was then get this filter to protect your lens and spend your time worrying about the sensor when you need to switch out your lens	1
0	i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked the older model is far superior this camera is slow to focus slow to shoot and slow to save i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition \( indoor medium light \) on the automatic setting all 5 pictures turned out different only one turned out clear i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with	1
1	got this camera because a friend had a similar one the blue tooth feature is just great you need a memory card to make if you want to take video 's and store a lot of photos the video 's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size all in all a great buy	1
0	there 's little more to say great item almost a must have but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal	1
0	i purchased this bag because i did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my canon rebel eos digital camera i only have 2 lenses but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables batteries etc i think this is a great unit for the beginner \( like me \) or the pro	1
0	this is not at all suitable for young children it 's awkward and difficult to use we 're sending it back totally inappropriate for children	1
0	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11 inch apertures so i expected better i ordered this for my daughter it arrived defective the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket making collimation impossible in celestron 's defense it likely happened in transit amazon 's return policy is not a hassle and i'm upgrading her to another telescope i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	1
0	well at least some stuff is cool free cam bag the pics come out excellent the video feature is really crappy and when you play back video its very choppy and the audio is a little hard to know whats being heard also you could through dozens of batteries with this cam the adapter doesnt help only if youre going to sit down and review whats on it or keep the power from draining the sd card kept popping out for someone which caused the cam to freeze up bottom line i recommend at least researching other brands of mini tapeless cams but this one isnt worth 159 or whatever its trash go for something else	1
1	me encuentro muy conforme con el producto es de excelente calidad y muy buen precio amazon es para mi el mejor sitio para la compra de cualquier producto	1
1	it 's good as my title says however i found one con about it is there is no place i can put a string on it so that i have to put it in my pocket when i take it off	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
1	i purchased this camera to use with my previous church 's media ministry based on my trial use of the vx2000 that was three years ago this camera is still running as well as it did when i bought it i use it upwards of 3 times a week to create content for web and dvd production plus i get great digital audio recordings when i plug directly into my current church 's sound system the ability to tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church i 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves	1
0	the case does not fit and the battery is incorrect forthe dx759	1
0	loved this camera the first month or so that i owned it two years later my feelings are very different batteries need to be recharged constantly camera rarely turns on after being off it 's dock for more than an hour all i can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying zoom is worthless pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated flash is also way too bright half of my pictures are annoyingly white looking because of this definitely going with canon on my next purchase	1
1	bought this remote about a month ago it does what it says you can even use it from behind great little device for the price	1
1	i purchase this lens for the digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon so far the lens has performed as expected it is solid and well built sticks slightly when zooming through 200mm images are crisp and focus is sharp working at 300mm can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod shooting a bird in flight at 300mm is a trick overall good lens for 200 if you have more money then a lens with image stabilization \( is \) would be the way to go	1
0	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
1	yep it extends the eyepiece out a little bit which helps those of us with noses not smudge the lcd display but it also distorts the view in an annoying way i use mine on occasion but not all the time	1
0	do not buy the case canon sells for this camera it takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in	1
0	the documentation is terrible its going to take a lot of practice if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine however i want to use it off camera to trigger 2 x sb600s just setting the d200 to fire a pre flash that will trigger the sb800 masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail in the manual the sb800 is designed for this purpose so why not include information on how to do this \?	1
0	the camera \( canon s 80 \) barely fits in the case and there is no room for even an extra storage card much less a second battery pack or the charger i ended up using my old tamrac case that has an extra zippered pouch for accessories total waste of	1
1	this is my first camcorder so i do n't have much to compare it to but i 've enjoyed it so far it 's easy to use the picture quality seems high the only minor problem i 've found is with the headphone input had to try three different sets of headphones before i could find one that would fit into the narrow slot where the headphone jack is	1
1	i do weddings portrait and outdoor photography and i do n't see any reason why i 'd ever switch from the d70 \( other than the d80 \) this camera is professional grade at the consumer price point do n't be scared by the 6 1 mp i print at 20x30 all the time w out any problems i 'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
0	cons only no pros the velcro closure is week and opens easilyterrible lookthe side zippers are a mistery totally uselessno space for extra memory or batteryattaches only to a very small beltthe flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash	1
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads panasonic not lumix fits the camera perfectly no extra room for memory cards spare battery charger etc it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down the belt loop wo n't fit most belts no straps however the camera 's strap is good enough good protection	1
1	purchased as a gift and well received seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner runs everyday all day and no problems encountered displays vacation pictures clearly like that it is big enough to view across the room frame is more compatible with decore than the 7 model previously purchased	1
1	i have not yet used an fz30 or fz50 but i think this thing beats the pants off an fz5 or fz10 as far as image quality is concerned really nice camera has a nice dslr type feel 71 of people that check out the fz20 here actually end up buying the fz7 \( as of today \) but i do not believe the iq of the fz7 could hold a candle to that of the fz20 buyers may be on the more megapixel bandwagon you can do a lot with 5 megapixels i have found that the iq of the fz20 is very close to that of a dslr	1
0	hello all lens hoods are pretty much a necessity but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used unlike other hoods that screw on this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one and release the clips this leads to problems of alignment meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right although it 's a pain and i hate i do n't really have another alternative either go w o a hood or take this one either way guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one	1
1	i have received this camera for serveral weeks it 's a good long zoom digital camera i can use it for 18x optical zoom when i set its photo size less than 3m ez the photo is n't blur as i use image stabilized the picture is sharp image quality is good however i have to set the iso at 100 or 200 when the iso is 400 or above i can see the noise and the picture lose detail but every camera has its own defect overall i am satified with this camera and i am enjoying using it to take pictures	1
1	i took this case with me to my trip to new zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing if i did n't have this case i would have missed out on amazing shots it 's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well i loved it so much i actually bought one for my sister as well it is a great investment for anyone that does n't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	1
0	i purchased this for my 10 yr old son i was surprised at how well cheap it appeared we took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first then it worked for about 10 minutes then it never worked again and we had to return it amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly we ended up buying the dgx 5 1 mp from a local store i it 's place it has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth not a professional photography instrument but a pretty decent unit for him	1
1	camera arrived earlier than i expected and was just what i wanted very small but versitle large screen very satified with my purchase	1
1	i'm sure there are those who 'd wax philosophical over the subject of filters and how one brand is much better than another but for my canon ef s 10 22mm on a 20d i figure canon would be fairly good at making a filter that they 're willing to have branded canon it fits fine does n't interfere with the lens hood looks clear seems to attenuate that nasty ultra violet part of the light spectrum and perhaps best of all protects the front element what more would one want	1
0	this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver \( the smallest one you can find \) to achieve it unfortunately i have wasted my money but luckily you do n't have to	1
0	so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont then after a week it just stops working dont get it theres no flash whatsoeve	1
0	we never dropped our camera and until now its still looks fresh and new and one day the lens just wo n't open it lights up then after a few seconds it turns off automatically called a up a kodak service center and they gave me a quote for repair the price they 've given me is close to my purchase price here in amazon ! i 'll never buy a kodak camera again until they come up with a good pricing for repairs i do believe that all electronic gadgets die at some point so i'm expecting a believable quote for repairs i think kodak is making expensive disposable digital camera	1
0	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly	1
0	the bag is suppose to hold two cameras i have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries i recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not sl	1
0	fuji fails to honor warrantee do n't buy from themdo not buy the fuji digital camera they charged me for a fix within the warrantee period their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee	1
1	have had good luck with these batteries they last for a long time first time with amazon and it was a good experience will use them again	1
1	i have been using kodak cameras for years this is my third kodak digital camera it does everything including taking excellent close up wildlifephotos it is as easy to use as a point and shoot however it does have all the bells and whistles needed for a professional style camera it is well worth the money look no further this is the camera for you	1
1	i needed a tele lens to complement my d50 purchase a did n't want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz10 in sharpness this certainly did and the vr really works i am able to take sharp pictures up to 1 40 my d50 flies on it	1
0	a great idea poorly executed the construction is cheap the screen is marginal at best but worst of all it refuses to recognize any of the 3 digital cameras i have on hand or a usb card reader a piece of junk that i am now returnin	1
1	this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes we purchased it for a cruise because we wanted to carry on the camcorder and have it protected but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras	1
0	i bought this recharger kit specifically for a sandisk m230 mp3 player when i first received the kit i charged all of the batteries upon first use i only got 7min out of each battery when i got 20 hrs from the batter sent with the player i learned online that the batteries still have their charge but due to the battery 's memory effect or voltage depression my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min if you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much juice is left in a battery do not buy this kit	1
0	i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock money thrown away ! ! the camera does n't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk also in my opinion it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it i threw it on the floor and smashed it not kidding ! when i first got it i called kodak and they told my son \( who is knowledgeable in this stuff \) how to reset the printer we reset it and it worked for awhile then it would n't work any more and i did away with it no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked	1
1	this is the best price i found for my second rechargeable battery for my nikon coolpix 5200 it 's perfect and so nice to have a second battery ! ! ! it was shipped so fast i received it within a few days	1
1	it is extremely easy to use hard to figure out the menu but once that is done there is no problem takes beautiful pictures great for action shots as well seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in	1
1	i bought these binoculars for my dad for christmas and he is absolutely in love with them the distance it can handle is slightly above average but the clarity is really where this thing shines its very easy to use and has held up reasonably well i would recomend it to the casual user	1
0	this kit is just junk the quot deluxe blower brush quot is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size there is a quot tweezers quot that is just folded aluminum sheet metal there 's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution the quot lintless cleaning cloth quot is an about 3 quot x 5 quot piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you 'll use about three times and then throw away this kit is not worth buying at any price because it 's not worth the shipping charges	1
1	love this battery long lasting and just as good as the name brand	1
0	yes it does provide a bit more eye relief and can make it easier to see the whole frame \( by making it smaller \) but there is a major problem with this the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses	1
1	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly it snaps on and off easily angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser	1
0	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact i'm sure it takes nice pictures but a lot of cameras take nice pictures i have to go where the service will at least respect you	1
0	it was not all there the part to put the camera on did not come and i need that to put the camera on so please it for a c875 camera please think you w b	1
0	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
1	the picture and dimensions are incorrect it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue the correct dimensions are 2 9 x4 2 x1 8 \( wxhxd \) it also fits the fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it for amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture i am keeping this one it is a perfect fit	1
1	i canceled this order because shipment was n't going to arrive in time for christmas	1
0	ok this is the third sony handycam i have owned and this is the most lacking in options sony messed up with the usb port because if your looking for that one just spend the extra cash and get the trv 280i had the 280 and it was stolen from me so i came on here and saw the trv 138 and i purchased it and was disapointed in the picture quality its fuzzy im in the process of seeing if the seller will return this camera so i can get the trv280 back i hope this has helpe	1
1	do n't believe the marketing kodak does i was using only kodakfilms for nearly 5 years i recently switched to fuji based on some online reviews i was pleasantly surprised at the results i highly recommend this film	1
0	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
0	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual i have n't decided if i'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey market version of this unit	1
1	very compact light and easy to hold full marks for design buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to but ok once mastered main downside for me it only takes dvd r rw and not dvd r rw bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones ! also can be a problem taking it abroad i had issues charging it as it would take a standard us to uk converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal us plugs	1
1	yes this is a very good first camcorder i am a first time user of any cam corder i have olny had mine for a month or so but i have made several films with it and it is very inersting but the software is harder to use that movie maker but if you are a first time buyer then i would go for this becasuse 20gb is engough to use but the battery life is short but u wont need to make a feature length film ! ! ! it is just fantastic enjoy do	1
1	i like this small thing work great and cheap	1
1	i purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches i use an original canon digital rebel and the shots are really very detailed it is easy to use in fact i can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand made craftsmanship of the watches its f2 5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge if you own a canon digital slr and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you	1
0	i was not satisfied with the quality of the digital pictures on this ziga digital frame i returned it	1
0	i purchased this for my daughter since i had already had purchased one for myself the pictures are clear and crisp if i had to buy another i would purchase the same	1
0	the camera operates good but i thought it was suppose to be new it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom it does work but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out	1
0	i purchased this frame as a gift for a friend of mine when i saw it on her desk and noticed the terrible quality of the images i was embarassed that i had given such an inferior item as a gift perhaps the images she had loaded were quite low resolution but the pictures looked terrible with huge pixels i would not recommend this item at all	1
0	decent camera but not great shark mode is nice housing looks good but mine leaked at 20 ft camera was dead by the time i got it out of the water good news is that amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week net result was one decent picture and a disappointing christmas present next time i will buy a housing for a better camera canon has some nice ones	1
0	be warned if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing sharing whatever ca n't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step i was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks but could n't find one i searched all over asked in several places on the apple web boards talked to the 'geniuses' at the apple store this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive talk about crazy !	1
0	bought the camera charger and the kit as part of the deal every thing looks good except the missing npf 50 battery requested for a replacement in the replacement kit also battery was missing returned both the items 59 99 for a carry bag and 3 dvd sis not worth buying this item	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	love my new jvc everio the original model just used compact flash cards but the new everio gz uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year 's worth of video on it ! tape is definitely dead and dvd camcorder 's 30 mintues a disc does n't hold a candle to the everio the only issue i had was that the software that come with it was pretty basic but all the other video editing software programs did n't recognize the everio video files \( mod files which contain mpeg2 video and dolby stereo audio \) i did finally find adobe premiere elements 2 0 which supports this new file type natively it has made editing a breeze	1
1	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography i bought the 17 85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post processing in raw i also have a 70 300mm lens for sports outdoors nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend pay the extra and get this over the rebel xti you wo n't be disappointed	1
0	i purchased this camera for my 13 yr old daughter as her first digital camera it was a christmas present so i am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase the flash stopped working the picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo 's indoors or in low light i would not recommend this camera	1
0	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
1	i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product great quality nevertheless	1
1	i can not find anything negative to say about this camera i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio 's exislim even though this camera is not as small as the casio it is far superior of a camera size why 's it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it is n't awkward or difficult to use the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera the lcd screen is also very clear unlike the casio and other camera 's similar to this one you ca n't go wrong with this camera highly recommended	1
1	it 's a pretty convinient bag i put a canon rebel xt with a tamron 28 75 lens a canon 70 300 lens and a external flash inside and i still have the small pocket for wallet keys etc the only drawback of this bag is you can not put in big lenses the canon 70 300 is the limit but if you only have a limited gear collection you need to give it a try	1
0	like another reviewer 's my experience has been mixed i use this remote with the d50 sometimes the remote works then it goes on strike then suddenly it works again same distance and angle from the camera i changed the battery same result i hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable	1
0	half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless should have sent it back	1
1	i bought two one for me one for my daughter it is compact user friendly it has nice sized screen it comes with a charger \( i 've been told that some do n't \) 6 2 mgp video with audio all this for a very nice price	1
0	i have had several people take my pictures at first everything is fine the pictures are ok the next day my face looks like a pile of baby vomit it is soooo blury then it got 2 the point where every picture i took was blury i tried fixing it online \( like on the program for the camera \) and it would not work i hate this camera ! ! ! not to mention the battery sucks it lasts maybe 3 1 2 hours this camera should be 99 00 trust me people if i could rate this thing at a zero i would it is not worth it however a camera i absolutely love is the sony cybershot dsct5 an awesome little camera	1
1	i was really happy with the telescope it was a good buy too i bought one for a friend als	1
1	excellent choice to make a great job	1
1	received camera exactly as described easy and smooth transaction would by from this vendor again thank	1
1	i wish i 'd bought this a loooong time ago ! it is so helpful esp with macro shots highly recommend	1
1	i have n't used it much but the few photos i have taken are excellent i'm not a photography expert so i 'll leave the technicalities to others telephoto capability is increased noticeably but not a huge amount the high quality of this lens as with the wide angle is obvious comes with caps and a storage bag	1
0	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
0	i bought this about 10 months ago with an additional camera the night vision only works on one of the cameras and the interference is horrible it snaps and pops all night long and i have to move it all around to find just the right spot i actually have to sleep with earplugs in to drown out the noise i live in a single story 2100 sq foot house i should have returned it right away but i kept it because i had no other monitor at the time now 10 months later the volume control does not work anymore ! i am now trying to find a new monitor i love having the video monitor though so i will look for a different brand	1
1	it was everything it was reported to be it works very well we take it on every trip we take	1
1	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel \( grey body \) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
1	i bought these for a trip to costa rica and used them every day they are comfortable easy to focus and a great choice for the price these are perfect for folks like me who are interested in casual use for travel concerts sports etc	1
0	instead of this pick up a plextor convertor box it takes the output of the camcorder \( composite rca or s video \) and compresses that to mpeg 2 \( dvd \) or mpeg 4 \( or divx \) and includes software which easily burns that to dvd or cd \( mpeg 1 or mini dvd \) look for plextor 's m402u box unless you really want to deal with 3 125 mb of data per second \( 25 mbps \) or about 180 mb per minute or about 11 gb per hour through the firewire link get the m402u your options will be greatly expanded and you wo n't tell the difference by looking	1
1	one of the reviews i read before purchasing these suggested that the reviewer should 've had them for her celine dion concert i took the suggestion and they were perfect ! they fit nicely in my evening bag and brought celine closer to me as i sat in the second mezzanine at caesar 's palace ! not only that but the price was right ! i could n't be happier ! plus now i have them for our next trip to rocky mountain park to get up close and personal to some wildlife	1

0	the roll of paper that i recieved had what appeares to be 3 roller marks down the paper i am trying to get it replaced but adorama is not willing to help out because the order is more then 14 days old i was not informed to inspect the product on arrival to insure a 14 day turn aroundf on issues	1
1	i fried my charger in mexico and needed to replace it this was the exact replica and it works great	1
0	doesnt work even though the lenmar website says it does i thought it was a pretty good deal for 26 i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work	1
1	i purchased this for my canons500 i have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new good quality construction and a great look feel	1
0	me and my wife bought the jvc camcorder and burner set up to send dvd 's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time at first it worked great then after 2 3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc we have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10 we returned it to get another and it did the same thing we thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal i do not recommend this to anyone	1
1	for the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times this flash solves the problem i 've dealt with adorama several times and it was a pleasant experience items were sent quickly	1
0	just returned the mobicam had poor reception even in adjacent room ! smallo screen not stable falls easy seems like would break very quickly with a 3 yr old in the house !	1
0	horrible camera barely had it 2 months before it went on the fritz drained the batteries within a few pictures so not worth more then the cost of a disposable ! ! sorry kodak but i 'll stick with the good ol' reliable sony	1
1	kodak v705 black small can carry in pocket wide angle lens great for group photos fast start up time video mode is easy built in mic picks up all the sounds camera can stitch 3 photos together great for vistas i am happy with this camera bought another v705 in silver for my friend and she loves it kodak makes easy to take photos weak flash try not to be more than 6 8 feet away or use photoshop on photos	1
0	i used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it it took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more then nothing for the rest of the roll we swam with sharks and i have nothing to show for it should have bought a disposable one	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
1	i bought this camera for my sister as an early christmas present thinking i would need some time to set it up for her well in less then 30 minutes i was ready it 's a awesome camera i was impressed of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 sd card i have sent the site to another sister whom is interested it is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone great photos from very close to far away i would recommend this camera to anyone	1
1	the part is definitely up to nikon 's awesome standards i bought it for future use as i do n't currently have the lens yet but when the price becomes affordable i will purchase it too	1
0	it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs this hood how can you pay 75 for a great prime lens and 25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it	1
0	hp is selling this bag for 30 bucks so when i found it here for 10 less i could n't let this deal pass me by however when i received the bag i wished i had the color is less vibrant it 's cheap poor quality plus hp is n't embroidered on the bag walk away from this bag and get the blue and black hp bag instead it costs a little bit more but it 's well worth it ! !	1
0	the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond i ca n't tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging how to i recharge it \? nothing tells me how to recharge it so far money wasted unresponsive to my emails	1
0	i agree with m arse with the 2star rating i was disappointed with this camera from the beginning not a user friendly one and the pictures turn out very grainy with bad color quality unless you are in an optimum light i'm interested in the 7 mp camera canon offers i 've read that it has much better shutter speed recommended \? \?	1
0	very dissappointed my son \( i bought this for them \) hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used audio just static and noise i did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might not work try telling this to me before i purchase thank you this is the last i purchase equipment on line i will stick to books thank you very much	1
1	can someone who bought the kit from adorama tell me 1 \) the battery is the canon genuine nb 1lh battery \? 2 \) the camera case is canon psc 50 case \? thank you in advance	1
0	tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d 524 camera turned out to be a downgrade did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts it would die a sudden death no low battery warnings before the camera shut down i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts the cr v3 now gathers dust it did not even improve the flash recycle time just a waste	1
0	this is a terrible product 1 the binoculars are very heavy and awkward to use 2 the pictures are extremely poor 3 the company offers poor service and packaged instructions are very brief and insufficient w	1
1	i love this camera i have now traveled all over the usa some places in europe and will be using it in china lens is excellent i wish it were lighter weight but ca n't have everything and this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom i have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else	1
1	this was my first digital camera and after reading everything i could get my hands on to read about digital cameras i chose this one it so happens that the last 35mm camera i owned for years was also an olympus	1
0	i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great but today i tried to turn it on and it 's completely dead ! i even changed out the batteries and it 's still completely dead this is the first digital camera i 've had and i bought it because i'm going to europe \( two days after it died \) now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off grrrrr ! !	1
1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with unless you are going for a very shadowy high contrast image this diffuser can save the day it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
0	i had jvc product and some of my friends too these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly price may be less buy its not worth for long run i feel sony and canon are better than jvc even hitachi is good	1
0	i took it straight out of the package plugged it in for a charge charger never reached green ready but the battery overheated and melted several hours later customer service was not the best i 've had do n't make the same mistake keep looking	1
1	i gave this camera 5 stars because of it 's awesome features this camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera i love this camera i think it takes awesome pictures	1
1	my bother in law and i went to africa on safari last year we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter he used them for the entire season last year and when he visited the states last month he reported that they are still doing well	1
1	very happy with our camera ! perfect condition and quick arrival	1
0	this is a 1 2 volt battery charger useless for anything that requires aaa 1 5 volt batteries	1
0	ok maybe a 1 star is actually fair since my nose does n't smudge the lcd screen as much the most annoying thing for me is it constantly falls off the camera both my 30d and rebel xt if i am lucky enough it will fall off get lost and eventually i will not be reminded i wasted money on this accesory	1
0	beware of poor cs policy at jvc they recently let me down when it was obvious the camera was poorly designed and built they were not interested in even trying to help i hate it when companies only care about their profits	1
0	i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months but i was happy with the picture quality i replaced it with the s5100 it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 \( in particular shutter speed choices \) while on a trip to niagara falls i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt \( and i mean slight \) after that it would n't power up i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable	1
0	this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else it does not include a docking station you have to shell out more money for that option i dont think so	1
1	i bought this together with the sony alpha \( very good deal from amazon \) the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18 70 images are very sharp and the lens is built very well great for wildlife imaging the other reviewers are right the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera the end of the lens does rotate while zooming it may not be good for some filters	1
0	i loved this camera when i got it but after three months the lens would not close it makes grinding noises the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again i am very disappointed in this camera	1
1	i used the product at victoris falls and was very pleased at this time i have not gone under water with it	1
1	this cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you ca n't say which company it belongs to i have used a lot of sony products and i feel it is not up to the standard of sony it works great had no problems so far it is flexible kinds so you do n't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your tv	1
0	poor quality unit worked sometimes sometimes not gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out	1
1	i am starting my career as a professional photographer and i have n't had any problems with these filters they come in a nice case and are easy to attach to my lenses	1
1	goo	1
1	it is a great compact camera with a good zoom i can now leave a larger lens on my nikon dx 70 and use this for closer shots you do need to try different settings to make sure you get the color you want i really like it for most general quick shots carry it wth me most of the time	1
0	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
1	this is a nice bag but do n't buy it for a canon s2 is it will not fit the product compatibility lists the s1 is since the s2 and s1 are very similar i purchased this bag i ca n't even get the thing in the bag it is a nice bag however and have put my smaller kodak camera in it there is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it 's accessories good quality	1
0	i just got this printer dock with a camera and the printer feature is a real pain ! the paper will almost never feed no matter what i 've tried when it does feed it ends up jamming i only successfully printed one picture and tried 7 others and then the laminate was gone i'm very unhappy with it and will probably send it back	1
0	i bought this camera a year ago the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light but for using indoor \( with flash \) is very very bad when you use flash the photo are not good but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice if you can bought another camera	1
0	this bag is very small my canon 20d fits nicely with a small lens but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body we kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	1
1	third camera from kodak easyshare great performance and pics slendor size	1
0	good motor drive speed grip feel takes nikon lenses reacts fast to pressing the shutter release bad skin tone renditions a color other than skin white balance does n't balance well noise at anything above iso 200 looks like 3200 cf card door tough to open screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot battery cover is not part of the battery button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 4 1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements dumped mine a month after i got it	1
0	the case fits like a tight glove i do n't like that the camera was hard to get in and out and did n't have any pockets for straps or batteries	1
0	i received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it it screws in over the regular zoom lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the kodak dx6490 i suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future the lens adapter by itself does n't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else \? \? \? ben boykin las cruces nm 8801	1
1	i have the white one \( black was unavailable at the time of purchase \) 1 the camera will not slide out even though the clasp is magnet it is made snug enough that the felt holds it in the case even with a shake or jostle 2 durable no scrapes or scratches in 7 months 3 have n't missed the belt clip option its small enough to fit in my pocket4 well constructed durable people think its some sort of ipod case holder	1
1	having just gone back to using a film camera from digital \( my wife still uses digital \) i have found this to be an excellant camera so far i have taken 6 rolls of film and everyone one has came out perfect i would recommend it	1
0	i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them	1
1	my sony dscw100 camera is small but very functional and user friendly it makes photography an easy and interesting hobby	1
1	i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures and this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there are so many options on this camera i am having fun just playing with it to see what all it can do ! i would recomend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality camera at a good price	1
0	in an email adorama specified that the filter diameter was 28mm on the amazon com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting ! either they do n't know their products or they do n't care about the customers now i have to return it because of faulty information they supplied please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25 of the purchase price an amount i feel is beyond absurd i can buy this locally for a lot less \( even though i would have to pay sales tax \) buyer beware	1
1	fast delivery great price i would buy from them again thanks	1
0	rated one star for the lack of value you can buy the same canon brand case for under 14 and a higher capacity imho better albeit non name brand 1200mah battery for under 10 from amazon the neck strap is not worth the difference	1
0	if you like to take pictures with macro lense it sucks i 've had many canon cameras and this one takes the the prize for worst quality if you get closer than five inches the pictures messes up i 've had no other problem with the hardware though i hate carrying around that dock and it 's odd shaped charger no other charger cable in the world is going to fit ! so loose it and you 're screwed oh and night photos also suck big time even with the flash on	1
1	from all the reviews i read i expected certain pros and cons from this lens i was not disappointed pros very sharp lens with very good colorscons vignetting at wide open and a little too contrastyfor myself the pros outweighed the cons for the price it is ideal for the 1 6 multiplier cameras where it becomes a 38mm lens	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
1	i 've had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great except for the touch screen feature that takes a little getting used to especially when accessing the special features \( such as fader effects \) while filming the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer all in all it is a good product just takes some getting used to	1
1	took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible \( has a divider you can place where ever you want \) so you can secure cameras however you wish	1
0	yes i have to agree with the previous review it does n't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources it does n't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything if it was less expensive i would n't mind as much and just chalk it up to extra protection but that seems to be all it 's good for	1
1	great camera only bad thing are the batteries die very quicklyit takes great pictures and has some good features	1
1	other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping the battery itself in a good deal they work well charge up easy and hold their charge nicely priced well they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony i bought them for a d80 and the older en el3a would not fit of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80 basically the same size and shape but keyed differently i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s meaning they are backward compatable	1
1	i got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke it is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures its also very sleek and small	1
1	i have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy it has both point and shoot and slr features you can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography the software was easy to use easy to set up and it works well on my mac it has the quality the you would expect with the canon name	1
1	the lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility the stabilization aspect is a great help although it does n't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the canon rebel xt	1
1	this is the same charger came with my digital rebel however i like to charge two batteries at a time so i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact flat and easy to take along with you it 's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with	1
1	this case is great for the quick day outings it is rugged and keeps the camera safe my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead	1
0	very good product very satisfied the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette	1
1	it seems surprising that canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver	1
1	we use our batteries a lot no problems works as advertised	1
0	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
1	for its size and price this little light ca n't be beat very transportable and produces a dramatic influence on the image quality of evening shoots indoors i think this is a must have for camcorder owners my vhs family movies shot over 20 years ago are still a source of pure joy so i see this as a miniscule investment for the long term return	1
1	unlike many reviewers i am not diver i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park pool and beach this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash this case has out lived an s400 and s500 well worth the 170 price tag	1
0	i bought two one time but there was no vedio on lcd as opened for both ! they could not recorded vedio but audio only it seemed that they had n't ccd at all ! i had to mail them back to repare just the day i got them and the jvc even would not cover the charge	1
0	it 's only redeemingly quality is the price \( if you get a good deal \) photo quality is poor and screen is quite small \( 3x5 \) navigation is not overly complicated but buttons must be pushed hard to work it did work perfectly fine took sd card even connected to my mac and drag and drop photos onto the sd card i inserted into the frame but because of the poor quality of the photos i do n't suggest buying	1
0	if you purchase this wide angle lens adapter for the xacti hd1a you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash the adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos it does work well for video the sanyo xacti hd1a camera itself is a disappointment	1
0	the camera worked fine however after six months it stopped working i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism my use was in no way abusive i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage until i gave it away i guess i should have stayed with canon i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1
0	i got to get it off my chest this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful but the camera has several down sides 1 as all have said it eats batteries big time this is a pain 2 it recharges slow between flash and between non flash forget about catching a great spontaneous moment 3 not durable i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable any suggestions \? \? \?	1
0	i 've never ordered anything and been this disappointed i ordered two of these and both did n't work i contacted the company 's tech support and they told me to send it back and they will replace it i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased the item and they refused to give me a refund i am now stuck dealing with this company that has horrible customer support i will never buy another product from this company again	1
1	for the price paid this is a great camera should last me for a long time debated buying a slr but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr \( actually it is a slr just no interchangable lenses \) and a lot easier to use	1
1	the flash works very well i do wedding photogrphy so i need a good flash it works great i am very happy with this product	1
1	despite reading glowing reviews about this lens i was still surprised to see how well it performed the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes from a distance of three quarters of a football field away shooting hand held with late afternoon light which will print a 5x7 and still look like a pro took them ! if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and ca n't afford or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures then you should give this lens your serious consideration	1
1	i was amazed on how well this battery has performed i did make sure when i got it i did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since i can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder \( sony hdr hc1 \) it is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but i use the lcd when shooting anyway and almost always on tripod	1
1	this product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased the pictures are wonderful the initial downloading process was straighforward and problem free we actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do the slideshow feature is wonderful as well everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed to be sure they are expensive but worth the cost we will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly thanks to the folks at philips for getting this soooooooooooo right	1
0	i was down in antarctica when i turned on the camera and it said lens error after a day of missing some of the best pictures of emperor penguins with my 8800 i twisted the lens and got it to work the same thing happened to me in bolivia just after the warranty expired i called nikon and they insist there is no problem with the camera do a google search of lens error and nikon 8800 and you will find lots of unhappy people with the same experience this is my third and last nikon	1
1	i'm very pleased with this small unit that has a great deal of power it 's compact not heavy has an adjustable power output by simply spinning the wheel on the camera to the left or right in addition to the light output the head can be tilted so the light can be direct or bounced an excellent feature getting up and running with this unit was a breeze because i am totally brochure reading averse twenty years ago i was a photographer with big equipment but had given up both i was surprised by the control one has with such a small and relatively inexpensive unit	1
1	the sony cybershot is a great camera the colors and the features are amazing is very easy to use the only thing i dont like about the camera is the zoom in and out button if you zoomed in you wont be able to zoom out	1
0	the camera case only works if you wear a belt there is no clip on the case itself holds only the camera not even space for a spare battery or memory card \( i 've heard the case will darken your camera but i did n't end up using the case \) the neck strap is not useful it 's too long at '34 inches if you 're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it \( the canon camera rocks however	1
1	this is a good tool does the job well and serves the purpose but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer i give a 4 star because of canon not because of the product if you are willing to pay for it it 's a good product	1
0	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 which was way better than this camcorder this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it	1
0	i received this as a gift and at first i thought it was great but then i realized it would only display 142 images i worked with technical support for several months \( they are not the speediest or most helpful \) i resized renamed restructured the photos tried them on different media and finally they admitted it was a bug i rma 'd the unit at my shipping expense of course only to recieve another with the same problem i would n't recommend this purchase	1
1	your site was the only place where could find a replacement for my lost nikon uc e6usb cable for my nikon coolpix 3100 even nikon could not satisfy my request thank youcynthia valesi	1
1	i am not much of a photographer i found this camera easy to use and my pix are just great believe me it 's the camera the stabilizer thing works to give clear focus almost every time i can even put the pix up on the computer and send them easily i'm thrilled you do need to upgrade to a 1 mgb memory card when you buy the camera	1
0	it looks cool and it 's easy to carry but that is about it camera is slow and pictures are often blurry sorry i wasted my money on this one get one of the new ones with vr so you do n't have that issue	1
1	of course it had to be kodak no matter what people say i have always and will always use a kodak digital camera i 've found this camera to be a real warrior last one i had lasted about 4 year and this one looks even better photo cuality its very good and colors are great no excesive blue or red in your pics night photo taking its excelent in close shots 4 stars beacuse its really a batterie eater but its nothing a 25 batterie charger can`t solve sorry for grammar mistakes but english is not my natal lenguaje	1
1	after researching several cameras in this price range i bought the rebel t2 last month it has met my expectations and perhaps then some after recently trying out a friends camera in the 150 ish range i partially regret spending what i did it all comes down to what you need want and how many bells and whistles you like for the money though compared to the competitors i still think i made a good purchase after all if i use it for ten years which i most likely will i will have surely got my moneys worth bottom line no complaints with it	1
0	it looks great genuine leather much better than synthetic like a brand named leather wallet but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos there is no where to put the essential accessories \( battery and another memory stick \) there is no way to clip to the belt will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	1
0	i had an older canon camcorder that i was very happy with so i decided to get this new one i ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud i even tried the same model at best buy to make sure it was n't just a defective camera but compared to a similar sony model the canon was noticeably louder while operating way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions	1
1	i really enjoy this camera mine has the carl zeiss vario tessar lens it works grewat be sure to use the memory stick pro media a great reasonable priced camera	1
1	excellent product for the price pictures are not that good but you ca n't ask more for this price	1
1	very clear bright day strong magnification quality seems to be good very well priced at around 100 00 i will know more over the passage of time my firstimpression is good mj schra	1
0	im not from usa my brother bought me the camara in a trip three months ago and it is not working ! ! it has serious conection problems in the body that i cant fix in my country i lost 1000 us	1
0	it got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it \( a month or so later \) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly a huge disappointment and waste of my money	1
1	it is a great camera very small and gives very good photos in most circumstances grainy pic in dim light go to the casio website to download the new firmware for 4gb sd card compatibility you will get over 1500 high res photos with a 4 gb card where outpost is selling for 5o dollars a car	1
0	this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets quite small for the price just paying for the name on the bag	1
1	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens at 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
0	if you are shoting kid at the swiming pool it 's ok but if you are the open water diver please do n't buy it i try it yesterday it will not work after 10m 33ft it will show the red screen and count down timer it scare me and i miss a lot of shot for yesterday 's dive it 's really disappointed to me	1
0	while this lens has an attractive price tag this lens has serious trouble with sharpness only at high shutter speeds \( 1 250 and above approx \) or with a good flash and middle apertures \( f 8 to f 22 approx \) does it deliver sharp images horribly slow autofocus i am already saving to buy and l series or the is usm version	1
1	this camera works well except that the shutter speed is a bit slow the image quality is decent the use of aa rechargeable batteries is also convenient the camera is pretty sturdy i 've dropped it a few times and it still works fine	1
0	the magnetic clasp is weak very weak making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it 's own i keep this camera case inside of my purse i would n't recommend this productthere has to be something better	1
0	to customer before me you camera d200 might be on recall please check the nikon website for more info you have described the exact recall problem good luck ! btw have you tried or someone tried this battery on a d70 \? i am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the d70 and grays from the d200	1
0	my wife purchased this for me as a christmas present it started displaying pixels on the screen after about 2 months i 've called digital spectrum sent faxes and emailed them this has been going on for nearly a month a real waste of money my time	1
0	i have one and panasonic does n't have driver or processing downloads for it or even respond to requests the proprietary video format requires special handling in your pc and can leave you with a camera full of useless clips are they abandoning this product \? look on the panasonic website and see for yourself	1
1	i really enjoy this small high quality camara i purchased a 2 0 gb memory disk so i could take advantage of the 7 1 mega pixel and i get great pix everytime i have lots of fun with it since its so small it 's easy to take everywhere with me i also get lots of compliments on it 's fashionable sleek design i highly recomend his camera	1
0	the battery does not hold up after 10 months it would not work at all i thought it was the battery emailed support and was told the battery is not replaceable i found one and changed it out myself the unit was just dead warranty is 60 days will not buy another one	1
1	the cover over the lense broke small lcd screen pictures are pritty good battery life is pritty good some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady takes nice portaits easy to use has a veiw finder	1
0	beware of assuming that the uv filter recommended by amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that i purchased is the correct size it was n't even close no size was given for the lense diameter i returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping all the hassel of packaging it	1
0	i paid 99 00 for this little camcorder thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house but we could n't get the videos to transfer to the pc the menu button would not bring anything up so overall we just could n't get this thing to work a bummer of a christmas present	1
0	i loved this camera but i have had to send it back 3 times for the infamous system error 2 design fault which plagues many of these the repair service is slow the camera has been in repair 50 of the year i have had it	1
1	this can be used in lieu of a replacement battery plus if an electrical outlet is convienent like when shooting inside you never have to worry about running out of power also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc ac converter but not as overall convienent as an extra battery i thought it would also trickle recharge the battery but it does n't nikon should add this feature in	1
1	very nice bag and well made however i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment \( cords and charger \)	1
0	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
1	installing the software was a piece of cake using it is quite another matter the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles tweaks and options first attempts \? the moon came out real nice but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail nothing like type of pics that the super whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well \( oh was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions sorry celestron !	1
0	i bought this camera about a month ago and i am highly disappointed with it the quality of the pictures is very poor showing large grain even at shq and low iso settings no combination of settings seems to improve quality	1
1	this tripod arrived on time and in good condition however i have to put the heavy duty in quotations as this item is for amateurs mostly and is made of plastic as well the weight you can put on it is limited however it does the job well for the amateur photographer or videographer	1
1	i am pleased with the purchase very good value picture quality is good and it is easy to operate only negative is that it was advertised as wood frame when in fact it is plastic however it looks good this is my second purchase of this product one for myself and one as a gift	1
0	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	the leather is very soft and the case is simply quality i should have bought this one the first time	1
0	description or product is wrong there is no quad independent power charging indicators they are set up in banks of two one light for two charging bays batteries must be charged in banks of two tried e mailing vidpro for additional info on this charger e mail came back as undeliverable cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger	1
0	we have had this camera for about a year we wanted an inexpensive camera but buying this was a big mistake the picture quality is terrible and now it is not even working we have a canon powershot a60 as well and have been very happy with the performance i would not recommend this polaroid camera to anyone	1
1	very happy with the lens and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself	1
1	i 've seen this item for no less than 7 00 elsewhere so i got a good deal	1
1	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 \? i ca n't believe the price i am struggling btwn buying the sony brandbattery and the compatible ones	1
0	it seems as if every time i want to use the camera the battery is dead i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day i should expect very much i'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes but i should n't have to do so	1
1	if you use the viewfinder instead of the lcd field it does not appear on the lcd you can only see it through the viewfinder this is different from previous models minor annoyance the quality of the videos was surprisingly good but it saves them in the quicktime mov format mov is not my favorite format but perhaps others will not be bothered by this although i had heard that the color on kodaks is not natural i have found it to be excellent the overall quality of the pictures is good for the price i think this is a very good value and adequate for most casual photographers	1
0	i am not satisfied by this product the calrity is not good also this is the most battery consuming device i have ever seen	1
1	i have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital slr battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these and the charger is okay just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most	1
1	is an product of great quality is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera	1
1	this is one fantastic flash i had it on my canon a2e for four years and was ambivilent but if you match this lens with one of canon 's newer bodies that has the funcionality to access all of the 550ex 's features you have an awesome powerful flexable flash that can change the way you shoot	1
0	thought i 'd died and gone to heaven this lens was everything i wanted and more three weeks after receiving it we went to the grand canyon and on the way home it suddenly quit doing the focus now it does a focus dance clunking and whirring and never coming to rest anywhere close to focus it 's not my d70 which still works wth other lenses this one 's going back to it 's maker ! if they fix it i 'll revise this review	1
0	the s9000 fits perfectly in the case too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop apparently the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also too bad the camera strap is extremely short made for very small people so instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well i will adapt the case to work for me i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on it will work but only after extensive modification great camera design so it 's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before	1
1	i needed this tripod to use with my 20x50 binoculars since the least movement with 20x magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field this tripod works well for that use it is sturdy has lots of features and is reasonably priced however if you wish to use the tripod for binoculars a right angle adapter will be needed i found one on ebay for a few dollars	1
0	i have an r717 camera i bought the dock too each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera i bought a clone battery \( not hp \) and its edges are rounded too maybe hp could explain the difference just thought you would like to know	1
0	date on still photo will not print it 's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo	1
1	i purchased a nikon l5 from costco 2 weeks ago but returned it on saturday after i saw the lz 7 the lz 7 is way better in all aspects than the nikon l5 save for the adjustable zoom in movie mode pros takes great pictures optical image stabilization 6x zoom and great price it is also made in japan not china as the nikon l5 is cons fixed zoom while in movie mode no on board camera speakers	1
0	i bought this frame as a gift for my husband and he was extremely disappointed with the grainy quality of the photos we promptly sent it back for a refund i would recommend spending the money on a better digital frame or save your money altogether and create a slideshow screensaver on your computer monitor !	1
0	here 's one more a95 to add to the ever increasing list of e18 failures thanks to the horror stories from the other posters i'm not even going to waste my time trying to get this repaired the camera is only about 2 years old guess i 'll put it back in the box and wait to see the outcome from the class action suits ! the camera really performed nicely when it was working thus the 2 stars hope you have better luck than me if you get one	1
1	this case is vital to protect the lightweight s1 which could be easily damaged from a drop the case does not detract from the convenience of the s1 it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily	1
1	300 plus minutes of recording time \( without lcd \) i still got several hours with the lcd backlight on for when you are out all day this is a good long lasting battery on the hdr fx1 i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me i ca n't say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height though i did n't have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time	1
1	this is a great lens for any user professional or amateur this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive clean results a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm \( 16mm cropped \) but this is easily correctable with software in addition the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door architecture shots \( especially realtors \)	1
1	wow ! ! ! this is my 4th sony i keep trading up and i am so impressed there is no delay on the shutter speed great pictures and enough special effects to be fun but not enough that you need a phd to operate	1
0	i loved the camera absolutely loved it i was using it one night and it died i went home and put in on the charger and nothing happened the light on the charger did n't flash or the camera did n't even go in after dying the second time i used it i just got back from vacation and put it on the charger i was able to turn it on to look at the pictures as i was looking at the pictures it just shut off i was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose i would not recommend it for this reason unless the charger you get is different than mine	1
1	takes great pics and the 3 screen is really nice wall plug in recharger is nice also i have taken pics outside in sunny overcast rainy conditions indoors at sporting events and around the house in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics however as canon 's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom 3x isnt enough when other cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom also image stabilzation should be included	1
0	crap does n't work wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period plastic junk never did get a good signal the worst sony item i 've ever purchased and i'm a sony fan will still attempt to return somehow do n't even bother	1
1	pros reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall better to break the hood than the front element makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you cons will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile	1
0	i bought this camera and it took great pictures above water but none of the pictures i took underwater turned out i looked at the negatives and it was like i never even clicked the shutter the negatives were blank where i took the underwater pictures	1
1	this is why sony is hot ! this sexy little \( yes its really small the size of a pack of cards \) it takes perfect clear and crisp pictures and the battery life is a long 320mins perfect for a vacation make sure to get a memory stick with it though because w o it it only holds about 15 pics this is my first digital camera and i would definitely buy sony again	1
1	after 2 years the camera 's original battery was losing its ability to hold a charge this replacement battery arrived promptly fit easily and was fully charged in a couple of hours i wish i had replaced the battery sooner instead of constantly worrying about running out of battery power	1
0	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over exposed i have n't changed anything or done anything i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
0	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
1	i love this flash i just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly i still do n't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual i would definitely recommend this flash	1
0	unless you want to have trouble focusing have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event or have the neck strap bracket break off etc i wear glasses and these never did focus well for me i was not happy when the bracket broke off the day i received them just as i was to leave for an africa safari vacation the biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip and it was frustrating even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired suposedly there is a warranty on these hah ! when i sent them to bushnell for repair they wanted	1
0	i had my sony dsc w70 for just one month when the viewing screen suddenly cracked without being dropped or hit the glass itself was intact but something underneath was clearly broken mailed it in to the factory service company for sony and i was informed 3 weeks later that it is not covered by warranty and will cost 181 to repair this is 2 3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially i have a friend who had the same problem of a broken screen with the identical sony camera	1
1	this product is exactly as it is described wonderful tasting and delicious too bad it does n't come in a bigger container	2

1	sure it 's not 100 pure vanilla extract that 's indicated quite clearly in the ingredients molina vanilla is made with a mixture of pure vanilla extract and synthetic vanillin personally i love its strong distinctive flavor regardless of what percentage pure vanilla extract it is for those who feel it 's too strong use half the amount listed in the recipe i know a couple of people who do this when using molina vanilla again i like the flavor so i use the full amount called for in the recipe this stuff has a great flavor that really kicks things up a notch	2

1	i have been buying this stuff since the wholesale club had opened in my town seven years ago i was horrified this past thanksgiving to find out they no longer carried it i tried to improvise with garlic powder and italian seasoning but my homemade ravioli were not nearly as good as they had been in the past i ca n't say enough great things about this stuff i use it to season burgers steak to spread over chicken with a little olive oil before baking and grilling and in all of my stuffed pasta dishes it 's not just great it 's amazing ! !	2
1	i did n't realize when i bought them they were so big i just thought they were little bottles they still have the same great taste	2
1	yes the coffee is the best quality pesticide free there are technical issues with the pods 1 pod was broken when i opened up the pouch it was stored in for any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable also many times the pod is not working but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work \( i have black decker home cafe machine \) great coffee but i felt that i had to really work for it i also feel that to charage 15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive considering that they are being shiped from la not hi	2

1	great product for chocolate lovers and social lovers alike more of an end of the night activity unless you 're just having a dessert party of course ! my one complaint is the impractical \( although oh so whimsical \) tissue packaging it is hazardously absorbent even the assertive flavors of these high quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items note do not store next to your curry sampler best of luck chocoholics a z	2
1	if you appreciate caliente you must try this	2
1	this tea is awesome i had it in a restaurant once and tore off the little label and came home trying to find it on the internet after finding it on amazon i looked up all the benefits of green tea and realized that original green tea is kind of disgusting so i ordered the jasmine green tea and with a little sugar and lemon i drink it every day excellent product ca n't live without it	2

1	i use almonds in cereal cake and bread both for nutrition and taste for years i 've been grinding my own this is a high quality product that saves time since it 's already ground the price is highly competitive	2
1	much better than some of the other coffee gift baskets ! i ordered a gift basket last year for my mom for christmas that ended up being basically 2 cups worth of coffee and a few mugs not worth the cost ! this basket contains a little more coffee as well as some cocoa and cookies ideally i 'd prefer to buy a basket that included a lot more actual coffee but this one is way better than most i have ordered in the past ! it also comes in a very nice basket which is great to re use for making your own gift baskets or for attractive storage	2

0	i was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements i had nothing but high hopes i was totally open minded i thought it seemed too good to be true \( low cal no carb noodles ! \) but hey i'm an optimist guess what \? it is too good to be true ! i read about washing them and drying them i did no problem i added sauce i put them in my mouth the taste was not the problem it was the texture it was seriously like chewing rubber bands no noodle resemblence whatsoever i honestly ca n't understand those who rave about these but hey to each his own	2
0	the photo shows four containers each 9oz the product is actually only one 9oz container very misleading possibly intentionally so also shipping costs 10 for a 9 product \? give me a break ! on top of it all the chocolate is nothing special you can get 16oz containers of ghiradelli drinking chocolate in specialty shops for 10 which tastes better	2

1	first of all wow instant noodles for sale on amazon \? second excellent decision on selling nongshim 's shin ramen nongshim is the market leader in korean instant noodles which are epitomized by shin ramen 's trademark spicyness and deliciosity not as filling as the non cup version \( which you have to cook over a stove \) this small guy does pack a punch and will keep you satisfied for three hours until you get hungry for more shin ramen is second only to sutah ramen in my opinion	2

1	i received my package via ups in a reasonable amount of time the coffee itself is smooth and very flavorful but not fake tasting however i did waste a few pods trying to perfect the use for some reason a couple of cups came out really weak so i referred to the senseo handbook for a hint now when i put a pod in i make sure to smooth it out on top and make sure it is in evenly and snugly that seems to have solved the problem	2
1	i was really impressed that i was able to buy this product on line it was easy to make the purchase and received the goods on time i will definitely order from them again	2

1	i am new to the world of gourmet salts and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago ! the granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel but that is where the similiarities end the salt dissolves instantly on the tongue it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste the jar suggests it be used on grilled fish and salads but i would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also	2
1	my husband and i were introduced to market spice tea in 1984 while we were living for a few months in seattle we loved it and upon our return to jamesville ny begain to regularly order it many of our friends now order it too it is an ideal hot drink in the winter and equally good iced in the summer 23 years and counting it is still our favorite tea	2

1	this is a delicious basic thai yellow curry with some vegetables it comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal but i still found that with this meal i really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes nuts or eggplant i do n't have any thai places in my area so i add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that thai craving the sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp	2

1	i use these onions for just about everything they are pretty mild and really add a nice light flavor to your cooking this is about what i pay for three pounds so keep that in mind too when you order but then again it is online shopping for groceries so i guess it has to be pricey i use these on a daily basis and never seem to have onion breath ! great great stuff and i highly recommend them	2
1	a friend shared her marketspice tea with me years ago and i was so pleased to run across an old brochure she had given me i ordered some and that wonderful taste was still the same the teabags are so fresh and full of flavor that the oils in the tea cling to the clear bag they come in it 's a flavor you wo n't find anywhere else you can taste the orange and the cinnamon and they 're just a little sweet you may not need to even sweeten yours !	2

1	oh how i love the most delicious incredible edible fruit of the plant cucumis sativus who would 've thought that this was a member of the gourd family cucurbitaceae a cousin of the melon \? cucumbers have many great uses they 're delicious in salads and is there any snack tastier than a pickle \? i also hear they have non culinary uses as well some say cucumbers help to reduce the swelling around eyes or the bags under the eyes maybe that 's because they 're 90 water i 've also heard that there are more adult uses for the cucumber but i 've only seen that in movies	2

1	these crackers are absolutely delicious whether you need to be eating gluten free or not i ca n't getenough of them my favorite flavors are the plain and the herb flavored these crackers are thin andcrunchy and are just hard enough to be able to stick one in a jar of peanut butter and scoop a servingonto the cracker i love them alone i love them with tuna fish i 've used them for dipping salsa andguacamole but when i see them all disappearing quickly i hope i have n't used up my last box beingi am gluten intolerant this cracker has been a surprising lifesaver when i'm craving something crunchyand flavorful	2
1	i originally bought this small container of fleur de sel for a fish recipe i found that said it was de rigeur however i thought it was like any other salt simply grainier of course i only added a little bit of salt after i had grilled my fish and did not think it would add much to the dish can you imagine my surprise when i tasted the fish only to have a veritable bouquet of flavour explode in my mouth i must say that i'm never going to use commercial salt on my food anymore now i understand why the great chefs of the past and present consider this the queen of all salts	2
1	i first tried these in south africa now my best friend will ship some to me with packages that she sends on my birthday or other special occasions i love them ! i want to have them here in the states ! ! !	2

1	this was not exactly what i was expecting i thought it would be more like what i call vietnamese sesame balls yet they were pretty good despite my mistake	2
1	i like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea it has a great taste and is not super sweet i find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate unlike the other person i am not addicted but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies if you like green tea i think you will like these i drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it nice refreshing candy individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time	2
1	i really enjoy this tea has the best flavor of any of the oolongs i have tried the leaves are whole and you do not get a lot of tea particles in your cup or pot	2
1	we originally purchased this candy in walt disney world at the japan pavilion when we returned home the kids wanted more of it but i could n't find any around town i came to amazon and here it was they were thrilled it has a good flavor and texture and they really enjoyed it	2
1	i recently started a diet where i could only eat the egg white not the yolk because of the fat content i make a fruit smoothie every morning using egg whites as my protein source the powdered egg whites have simplified my mornings and saved me alot of time in the kitchen \( anyone who has spent time seperating eggs knows what i'm talking about \) not to mention not having to worry about salmonella anymore i also saved a boatload of money compared to buying the whole eggs this is a fantastic product and well worth the cost	2
0	i would like to buy one of these products from wine country gift baskets but i cannot find a description of what is actually in each one	2
0	come on this is 2005 twinkies are n't food anymore than cheez whiz is twinkies were invented back in the 30s before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while i'm just as guilty of that but eating twinkies is practically self mutilation look at the ingredients list and do some reading yikes ! everyone 's family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too sorry hostess that definitely does not include twinkies	2
1	this is very good peanut brittle i found no taste compromise even though it is sugar free in fact i found it superior to regular brands of peanut brittle i have eaten most peanut brittle is hard as a rock this brand had a perfect crisp crunch	2
1	the sugar free was very good i 've had the regular but these are really good too especially if you are a diabetic or just want to avoid sugar quite a few flavors	2

1	have n't tried cooking with them yet but they arrived quickly and are not damaged or bruised in any way they are beautiful specimens i immediately vacuum sealed and froze them	2
1	these egg whites work great and are economical i recently started a diet where i can only eat egg whites it seems such a waste to throw out the yolks not to mention the mess of separating the eggs i use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods the powdered egg whites do have an eggy odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets	2
1	better than expected quality very nice quality and very attractive quick shipping and response	2
1	i bought this candy and when i tasted it it tasted so good so its the best candy but it hurts your teeth when you eat but this is good and addicting cand	2

1	i got this as a recommendation from a friend and i found this to taste really wonderful it comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon i enjoy drinking matcha teas in the late afternoon to help me relax and this is the best matcha i have tasted if you 'd like to get wild sometimes i like to sprinkle the matcha powder on top of some vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dessert treat	2
1	do n't go for generic gooey dollar store imitations this is what gummy bears are supposed to be the next best are black forest	2
1	now i'm all in favor of hershey 's kisses but you look at this guy here and you kind of have to wonder i mean who buys 25 lbs of individually packaged chocolate count chocula on a bender \? perennial halloween door answerers preparing for the apocalypse \? let 's face it this is the ultimate milk chocolate and tinfoil experience i just hope you 're ready for it	2
1	this was a delight to receive ! it was delivered fast and was packaged beautifully ! there is a little something for everyone and everything is fresh and delicious i plan on ordering for friends and office for the holidays	2
0	i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i 've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i 'd give this a try these are gross not only that but they 're huge i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first before investing in my next 5 pound bag 2 stars because well it 's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible but still now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of	2
1	these are really good just like in the uk you 'd think they were caviar from the pricing though	2

1	tuscan milk kosher ! vitamin d and grade a ! good source calcium ! thank you	2
1	when most of reviewers praise other pocky this is really so much better it is more slender with richer chocolate it actually has more sticks than almost all other pocky types the chocolate is slightly bitter than the red chocolate pocky but no too much very balanced if you love chocolate this is definitly better worth trying	2
1	ume en is one of the best brands of green tea powder i have ever tasted this tea has a light delicate flavor with just a touch of sweetness which serves to make drinking this beverage a delightful relaxing and rejuvenating experience with this drink tea time is going to take on a whole new meaning i would definitely recommend this product	2

1	never had biscotti before what a treat since then i 've tried other biscotti and this was the best	2
1	nothing says 'taste of italy' like a gallon of tuscan 's finest the aromatic flavor of your favorite vintage is proper with any main course even veal ! it 's even great paired with dessert ! do n't be fooled by cheap imitations folks this is the real thing ! remember if it 's tuscan it 's kosher ! now with extra whiteness	2
1	i found this candy in the 7 eleven in my area two years ago and just loved it i would eat so much my mouth would blister inside but since last year have searched high and low but cant find it anywhere can i order it myself and not go to a store my kids love it as well and have tried other sour candys but none come clos	2
1	obviously the cheese is sent in a cooler box to keep it fresh and ready to be consumed by the customer dillon you idiot ! who the hell gives a piece of cheese as a gift what a dope ! i would rather have packaging that protects and saves my investment rather than looks pretty and dillon the moron talks about french cheese my last name is ouellette you cant get more french than that dumbass	2
1	i'm definitely a satisfied customer my dhl package got to me damaged and the box was wet the bubble tea customer service representatives where wonderful about replacing it i will buy from them again ! they have excellent customer service in my book ! thanks ange	2
1	my japanese pen pal y yamamoto just adores strawberry pocky and tells me they 're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations mind you i'm not sure i should believe yohko chan as she describes these situations many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way but i must admit they 're entertaining reading and the souvenier she sent me from that space hot springs was rather interesting although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me still i want to date her friend ruuan she looks hot in an amazingly ditzy sort of way	2
0	this tea is very bitter it is very aromatic it does smell nice and exotic but it was just too much for my simple tastebuds	2
1	this candy is awesome read my review i posted on the 5lb bag page and while you are at it buy the 5 bag they are way cheaper this 12 pack ends up being only 3 75 lbs and costs 12 50 and the 5lb bag is only 13 00 as of this review	2
1	this coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all it is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor i personally bought the beans in jamaica but it was only 12 for 12 ounces i have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it	2
1	the kaffir lime leaves arrived very promptly and had been kept cool they appear to be quite fresh have cooked with them it was wonderful thank	2
1	pocky are good if your a new to the japanese sugar covered biscut style of food i perfer yan yan i believe they have more substance but are more messy if you dont have biscut dipping skills	2
1	of all teas i 've tried this is my favorite sweet powerful and fragrant marketspice is the answer for many moods and cravings i prefer this tea hot steeped for 5 minutes but its good cold as well although i 've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming be warned if you only like very subtle white teas this may not be for you but it has converted many a non tea drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts	2
1	marmite is great its like eating the stuff you would scrape off the sole of your shoe after you 'd been walking around in an old factory for a day i think it tells about the character of a small island population that came to rule the world thank god they left before they had the rest of us eating this filth	2
1	if you like a strong but smooth flavorful coffee this is it i have tried others and just keep coming back to this one my second joice would be the starbucks italian blend	2
1	the best of the best for harley enthusiasts well written fair and honest great motorcycle accessory and clothing reviews terrific custom bike features and excellent presentation easy to follow tech and classics without all the girlie nonsense	3
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i 've paid and never received it i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point it 's been a couple months now	3
0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	3
1	i have read vanity fair for the past twenty years the articles are timely and in depth there are articles on politicians bankers ceos as well as the hollywood types this is the magazine for those who want to be in the know also the photographs are fantastic if you are looking for a two paragraph blurb about the actress actor of the hour this is not the magazine for you	3
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator readsomething else	3
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90 10 it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome in style has replaced vogue as my 1 fashion mag but i 'll always be a vogue reader	3
0	what is the national enquirer you ask \? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time avoid it like the plague	3
0	the heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive but it 's mostly advertising very disappointing it does have some useful info and i do enjoy reading it \( which is why it got 2 stars from me \) but i definitely wo n't be renewing my subscription	3
0	i'm very disappointed with this magazine it seems to be a total waste of money i found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2 3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas but it 's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something i can use	3
0	it is impossible to review this item as item was never received i have found it very difficult to contact anyone to find out where this item is	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market very realistic with budgets too it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable \( on any budget \) i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful	3
0	i ordered in november and i am still waiting to receive this item	3
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler this is not the mag for you	3
0	its been months and i still have not recieved my copy of this magazine they had no problem charging my credit card but they cant seem to get a copy of this weekly magazine out in under a quater of a year what a bunch of nonesense	3
1	i 'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name however i love all the other features in the magazine ! it is cooking light but there is so much more always an article on a travel destination an article on beauty and an article on a sport as well as other constants the theme of the magazine is total healthy living incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food though i do think that it is mostly a food magazine i gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive	3
0	i have read bird times many times the articles are much less complicated than the bird talk magazine articles which are fairly simplistic as well i recommend that you look at the cover and see if there are any articles that you want to read this magazine usually takes me 15 20 minutes to read and that is if there is an interesting article fewer ads than bird talk	3
1	for those of us who miss being in the center of the universe reading the observer is almost like being there in its pink pages i can read stories about new york 's political arts society finance sex and gossip scene i can smell the inside of a taxi from my house overlooking the lake in vermont	3
0	i received two free trial issues in order to give the magazine a chance before subscribing boy am i glad i did n't subscribe ! the magazine is nothing but fluff good only for people who mostly want to flip through and look at pictures not for people who actually want informed articles and reports on health	3
1	i like the different projects and items you can buy plus they give prices and online addresses overall i'm quite pleased with this magazine	3
1	budget travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland i also like some not all of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written however at the same time it does need better organization as compared with \( horrors \) conde nast i am diverting a bit but you may as well know that accessing your web site is impossible i cant access it ! !	3
1	my kids love highlights ! it 's applicable to both of their age ranges \( 6 and 9 \) and is a valuable investment for any parent i do n't know what i would do without this magazine it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car not to mention it 's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months	3
1	i always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom while she shopped i hung out in the magazine section reading mad cracked and fangoria now 25 years later i finally got my own subscription and unlike retro video games nostalgic 80 's cd 's and members only jackets this is just as good as i remember it gives the inside scoop on the up coming major studio horror releases the low down on independent if not underground extreme horror dvd 's and as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine it is a great read and a lot of fun	3
1	this magazine transports you to a different world every issue is a wish book with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month or crafts to do over your next long weekend or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room well in my life years go by and i dream on but just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped negative angry thoughts i will never laugh at crafty people again i will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside but the dreams are sweet the expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating but then you have gardening cooking baking furniture decorating beading anything do it yourself martha is truly a wonder woman worth every cent	3
1	i never subscribe to anything ! this magazine is great there are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes i'm on a health kick right now and find most cooking magazines are n't that useful to me i might enjoy reading them but i do n't actually use their recipes i 've made 4 of the recipes out of this last everyday food issue and they were very healthy \( lots of veggies chicken brown rice salmon etc \) tasted really good and were also fast which is a bonus for me i 'd give this magazine 10 stars if i could	3
1	ordered this for my son sometimes it takes a while for the order to reach him in prison so i'm not sure he has received it yet since you wrote and reminded me i'm thinking it did get to him as others have been returned	3
1	spike fett is mistaken the 100 greatest moments he mentions is not for all time they were the top 100 moments of the magazines lifetime which is only 8 years this is one of the best film dvd magazines out there i highly reccomend it it has awesome articles reliable reviews and great color photos another thing i like about it is that its an british publication so you get a different opinion and point of view its a great magazine	3
0	i had not idea that you could order that magazine directly from them until i bought one from our local super market i was surprised at the difference that i had already paid to order from amazon and what it was there i canceled my order and ordered from them some items are much less on amazon and some are much more you just have to be careful a magazine is a magazine no matter where it comes from	3
0	i looked at intermezzo in a bookstore and my husband purchased a subscription for us because it looked like a great cooking magazine beware beware beware ! i received a total of 2 magazines and repeated promises that others were on the way r tully is great about responding to emails it 's a shame the magazine does n't show up as promptly if at all i recommend cooking light it is a fantastic magazine with lovely recipes and incredible customer service they replace missing issues and do everything in their power to make the customer happy	3
1	this magazine is by far the best food travel magazine out a bit on the expensive side due to it coming from bbc in england but worth every pound dollar	3
1	as an interior design student i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration variety and creativity this magazine is more about art and design than advice on do it yourself decorating or cheap furniture finds so do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different more practical purpose	3
0	i ordered this as a gift for my neice for christmas it 's june and she has yet to get a copy i called them in march and they verified they have her correct name and address in their computer i 'll going to ask for a refund	3

1	i look forward to recieving my magazine every month i really love this magazine it has articles marriage sex women 's lives etc i do n't know why the others did n't enjoy it	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out every 10 year old 's top priority right \? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span better off with american girl magazine this one 's to mature for younger girls	3
1	the smartest best informed and most well entertaining writing about entertainment and popular culture i read it cover to cove	3
1	i really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it ! every parent should read this magazine ! really good activites and advice	3
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3
1	this is a fun read the articles are entertaining and short good to pass some time excellent for the plane !	3

1	still think that marie claire is a cut above most women 's magazines	3
1	i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall i had recently watched quot secretary quot and i liked her so i bought it i'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue after buying my first flaunt magazine i wanted to buy more but needless to say the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time \( this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there	3
1	i absolutely adore elle decoration as several other reviewers have noted unfortunately the american version ca n't compare the spaces are gorgeous and infinitely more imaginative and vivacious all of my american magazines \( with the exception of interior design \) get ripped apart with a few pages pulled out and the rest tossed elle decoration always gets saved in its entirety i highly recommend these magazines are eye candy and they are truly worth the extra cost of an import	3
1	i purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew who just loves it it is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it now only if he would put it down so others can look at it	3
0	amazon must think we are fools it 's 4 cheaper directly from stewart 's website on the other hand there appear to be a lot of fools here	3
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous 'insights' it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value	3
1	a good start to create your own business	3
1	great magazine this is not my typical type of read because i 've never considered myself as someone into computers or multi media but the great thing about this magazine is that you do n't have to be someone that already knows a lot about technology to learn about the latest gizmos it tells you about them in simple terms too no high tech vocabulary needed i feel informed whenever i read my monthly subscription of the better products to purchase as well as the politics behind the big computer and internet companies	3
0	this magazine fell apart so quick they are no longer a unbias magazine instead they are a interscope propaganda machine just look at the covers \? every year shady g unit gets a automatic 8 covers every album from that camp gets automatic xxl and xl ratings even the horrible tony yayo album got a xl maybe the most disgraful rating i 've ever seen in hip hop as a hip hop reader i can never take anything they write serious because they are tainted and corrupt i suggest you search else where if you want a good hip hop mag	3

1	i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas reference or to simply get those creative juices flowing how 's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business	3
1	great magazine covers the full range of net technologies every issue is packed with windows web and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more high recomended	3
0	two months after ordering the magazine i have yet to receive a single issue	3
0	this magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature stupid and boring the magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so called news coverage gives short details of events and people that does n't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste do n't bother	3
0	i subscibe to this magazine will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical it is way overpriced even with the amazom and others discount	3

1	smithsonian says it like it was albeit short and sweet without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship especially if it departs from traditional concepts their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh without cut and paste from the time honored sources their article on gavrilo princip the assassin of archduke francis ferdinand shook me to the core thanks smithsonian	3

0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living i was actually appalled by this magazine it is ostensibly health conscious but upon closer examination it ignores important health information for example in one issue it had a whole article about diabetes and how thanks to the miracles of science diabetics can now eat sugary foods it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet i was disappointed with the magazine	3
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it all i can say is the amazom service is terrible	3

1	i 've been a subscriber of e magazine \( which stands for the environmental magazine \) for over a year now and i love it it is by far the best environmentally oriented magazine i 've come across all of the ads are for environmentally friendly companies and products i now purchase products at at least 50 of the places advertised in this magazine e magazine covers topics all over the world including global warming horse meat \( popular in europe \) whaling deforestation etc if you are concerned or interested in environmental issues i would highly recommend a subscription to this magazine the issues are bi monthly but are absolutely action packed and fact filled subscribe today	3
0	i cook almost everything from scratch so i figured home cooking would be for people like me who make the effort to make good quality home cooking without the silly ingredients you see in some of those gourmet magazines instead recipes consist of packaged dough in a can bottled sauces etc i do n't need to read a magazine to figure out that i can put a jar of spaghetti sauce on some pasta and add velveeta to make a casserole !	3
0	as is typical of many magazines sunset jams it to existing subscribers they offered me a deal to re subscribe for 12 months for 29 95 ! here on amazon i can get two years \( 24 months \) for 29 95 magazines need to understand basic marketing it takes a lot of advertising dollars \( mailings \) to get a new subscriber once you have a subscriber it is easy to keep them if you treat them right charging existing subscribers double what is offered to new subscribers is bad business	3
0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	3

1	as a reader i become totally overwhelmed by the sheer number of books that come out each month i usually rely on friends' recommendations and more word of mouth advice but that 's never been enough for me reading a book is an investment to me and i want to make sure my time is well spent bookmarks gives me the confidence that i'm choosing the books i truly want to read i also find that the author profiles in bookmarks are timely and relevant to my broad tastes \( such as the ones on mario vargas llosa and the very interesting japanese writer yukio mishima which also shows that bookmarks looks globally not only regionally for classic authors \)	3
0	first off i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years and enjoyed it but the main guy robert kennedy is someone who offends me both personally and politically he assumes that every girl women reading that magazine is tiny for his information some of us work out 5 6 days a week and eat well and are still heavy set his comments on heavy set people are offensive thoughtless and sometimes even downright cruel nonetheless the pictures articles were inspiring to me and it is a decent fitness magazine	3
0	although i found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships i found that customer service was very dissapointing i missed an issue back in october and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue i missed it is now march and i still have n't received my replacement just a heads up !	3

0	this magazine makes girls who feel geeky and nerdy bad and girls who are normal teens who have crushes and like to stay in style terrible ! plus this magazine is sexist ! it does n't have models anywhere because it says that it makes girls feel bad ! if you want a magazine that is good and inspires read american girls or girls life !	3

1	i agree that veranda has too many advertisements but that 's the trade off for this very affordable high quality publication i'm not sure i'm the intended target for this magazine because i ca n't afford most of the things in the ads but i 've gotten lots of ideas about color layout and accessorizing that i can use and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style	3
0	where macworld is bad addict is dreadful it is dumbed down to the level of teen beat and the reviews do n't deserve the name the extent to which it drools over apple is embarassing leaving no pretence of independence like its competitor it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry so we get articles about the secrets of such and such product a secret in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer this should be blasted not applauded but addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product	3
1	i got a subscription for my father on father 's day and he really likes it recommend it	3

0	i wish that when i purchased this subscription i would have read all of the reviews unlike the description included on the amazon website the subsription does not include the cd rom which costs an additional 1 issue and if you want to purchase the cd roms for past issues they cost 4 disk sometimes a bargain is n't really a bargain buyer beware	3

0	this publication has no business calling itself a magazine published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies this is nothing more than a fluffy info mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo do n't waste your money	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
1	this is the magazine for windows it pros i have been a reader of this magazine since it first appeared at windows nt magazine over time it has gotten thinner but the articles are as informative as ever	3
1	this is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by herb glossberger who seems to only write articles about the people at la lifting club \( where he works out \) if you overlook that aspect the mag is great the knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by louie simmons and dave tate well worth it it also cannot be purchased in your local magazine store	3

0	my dad bought this magazine for my mom and i usually pick up the copies to browse them that is all both my mom in her fifties and i in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke it is not that special it is chucked full of ads the cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information i find this magazine a waste of our money it will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription my mom has already stated that	3

0	playboy made a mark in its day about 40 years ago today it is a totally unneeded magazine its concept of a mixture of quality articles mixed in with naked photos so that the reader will not feel quilty looking at the photos because he wanted to read an interesting article is actually quite goofy the end result is that the articles and the photos are lukewarm	3
0	love to review history today but have n't seen a copy yet any ideas	3
0	i subscribed to modern bride as a gift to my fiance aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription i only received about 3 issues total months went by without anything being delivered while customer service at modern bride was very accomodating and helpful nothing happens immediately when planning a wedding each and every month is precious especially during the initial stages of wedding planning to have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting plus by this time most of the wedding details were finalized the magazines i received became useless if you 're under 12 months to your wedding date you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with modern bride	3
0	i admit they have some good recipes but most of them are not simple and very time consuming there is always a million ingredients in each little recipe if you are a stay at home housewife and absolutely love to cook buy this but if you are just normal you wo n't find many recipes in here for you i suggest you consider 'cuisine at home' before you buy this one	3
1	had great expectations for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there \( and available on the web \) the how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of wired magazine elektor electronics and hardware hack websites would definitely like more stuff like making an xyz mill router instead of a feature on the mit fab lab in spite of all the above i have renewed the pricey subscription am still hoping	3
0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than 100 on babya outfits etc it is not a magazine for most of america but rather for the elite or those who wish to pretend they are there are way too many ads and insignificant articles parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category	3
1	i have a one yr old who enjoys babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys ladybug these are just the best children 's publications we save every babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic ca n't recommend these enough to family and friends	3
0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think probably anywhere between 1 5 2 5 inches it contained ads reviews supplier lists benchmarks and sometimes trial software well i have picked one up sense them and they are now a centimeter thick \( if your lucky \) they contain reviews that are well written or well read and a whole lot of ads my conclusion do n't buy it if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world and if you want ads surf the internet	3
0	to be honest i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year but i can hardly call myself a fan if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag wired is not for you it tries too hard to be hip and trendy but it 's group of left lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish wired needs to be rewired to meet the needs of the modern tech community	3

0	change can be good however sometimes change can be very bad earlier this year pc mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers before the change this was a magazine that i would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content now i can skim it in 5 minutes and do n't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time as a longtime subscriber \( 20 years \) i will not be re subscribing to the magazine i wish them luck but i believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	3
1	this is not my favorite fitness magazine this is the size of a reader 's digest but is packed with ads just like a beauty magazine i find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover they share reasonable and attainable goals and suggestions for us normal people the magazine seems to cover a wide age group with information that is good for both young and old they do offer recipes workout suggestions and much more the magazine takes little time to read and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy i think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	3
1	there is never a dull moment with this magazine ! you never know what the next story is going to be just that it will be a great read ! really good photography and illustrations too ! so if you are interested in what makes this world tick check out smithsonian magazine	3
0	the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women 's fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it should n't advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i do n't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that	3
1	unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents teachers this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do that do n't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials and that are very attractive when finished i also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it very important when it comes to encouraging creativity	3
1	if you live in the country and have a hobby type farm this magazine is bulging with valuable information i was surprised to find no color pages at first but the magazine is recycleable paper printed with soy ink very cool out of all the country type magazines i 've read this one is the best	3
1	i only got the first issue but it seems to be focused more on poets than other writers \( hence the name \) i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction they might do well to keep the two separate especially the contests and events it 's an attractive format and very upscale high quality literature reviews and advice the stories are well written and enjoyable although i think writers digest offers more for fiction writers	3

0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3

1	bell'italia is an italian language magazine that is to be read and savored and then saved for when you actually get to visit the areas described the photos and the narratives are excellent and they highlight not just those cities that are famous but those places that many tourists never get to see and that are just as deserving moreover in the more famous cities like venice and florence the places presented are often those that do not get much notice in addition the magazine highlights those restaurants and events in the area that will make the visit even more exciting i have been a faithful subscriber for the past 6 years and never miss an issue	3

0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still wo n't read the thing just like i do n't read the nation anymore	3
0	i have subscribed to in touch since september last year and it 's time to renew but i'm not goint to because this megazine is never arrived on time \( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive \) i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining	3

1	as with any profession or avocation or just down right fun habit it is only as good as the tools you use this magazine helps you keep up with the latest in the knitting world while still offering traditional patterns and methods there are lots of glossy shots of fibers and models with well defined patterns and suggestions you can find many great ads and reviews of other reading material	3
0	i was so excited to receive my first issue of art in america and i was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full page ads for galleries in europe there are very few articles or artist bios the photos are beautiful but do n't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about american artists or galleries	3
1	vogue fantastic high fashion photos if you love to look at beautiful clothing and shoes you need to look at vogue however as other reviews have indicated the articles are quite lacking they are often flat without much substance on topics that are frankly not interesting so you get vogue for the pictures if your looking to ogle pretty clothes or for inspiration for an art project this is a great magazine if you want something to read get something else	3

0	at one time southern living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas over the past few years it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food in a sad attempt to re arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook only the christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now we cannot speak to its information on gardening just the cooking part if it were not my mother 's habit of reading southern living we would have cancelled this long ago if you are a serious cook get the cookbooks from years ago the current magazine is well beneath you	3

1	of the big 3 \( fortune forbes and businessweek \) i like fortune the most businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose to report and analyze the business world fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does	3

0	give me a break people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip off wanna be of alternative press i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years think i may 've saved one of those issues sometimes i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind i 'll then take it home then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice avoid at all costs	3
1	i have subscribed for years to this in my opinion the hand 's down best most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available practical solidly researched non preachy and impeccably edited it provides even handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog 's happiness well being and ability to be a good companion the annual dog food ratings alone are worth the subscription price every constituency should be as well served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one	3
1	rue morgue is a true horror magazine you get countless articles on upcoming recent and past horror with interviews from writers directors stars and more there 's always tons of reviews on everything from theatrical horror to festival horror to those silly straight to video horrors crave more horror on the 'net then rue morgue is always giving you your fill on websites and what i 've always found to be an awesome thing about rue morgue there 's always full page ads of upcoming horror movies which serve as mini posters and they 're glossy paged rue morgue you just slashed into my heart and did it right	3
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips activities posters etc however i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance this continues though i asked them to stop for the last three or four weeks they 've been calling me on the telephone every day this continues though i asked them to stop the few good ideas in each 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment	3
0	this is a disgusting rag full of synthol articles profanity porn and blurry black and white photos it has nothing positive to say about bodybuilding and it 's obvious publisher steve blechman only wants to destroy competitive bodybuilding at any cost	3
1	someone posted below that they do n't receive all their issues i have never failed to receive an issue i suspect someone is making off with this person 's copies this is an elegant magazine worthy of martha if they cover a topic you will know all there is to know about that topic the recipes are little gems and i like the pullout recipe cards so they can be easily saved it 's a little oasis of calm in a frentic world i do miss martha 's column of reminiscences and wish that was back in the magazine	3
1	this is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines sports car international focuses on cars that are fun to drive the articles are interesting and well written the authors are n't afraid to point out a car 's flaws and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced most importantly this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast the authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive not stuff like cupholders if you 're into fun cars both new and old this really is a must have magazine	3
0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3
1	i love this magazine and am on my third year the recipes are interesting healthy and easy to make after a day at work they do n't use fake ingredients which was my complaint with cooking light i 'd rather use real yougurt than fake sour cream for instance and the recipes do n't take all day and 24 7 access to a gourmet supermarket like the ones in gourmet the nutrition articles are interesting and walk a sensible middle line between the low fat and the low carb camps real food for real life	3
1	came right away and in a timely fashion every two weeks ! great product for a wonderful price ! loved it	3
0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act everyone deserves intimacy emotional and physical if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife her happiness will be more important to him than his own setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be is the ultimate expression of love dennis j schleicher	3

1	i go to a gym where people share their magazines and came across this gem while it focuses on value vacation packages the benefit that i 've gained from it is its list of 40 top vacation packages to destinations around the world the magazine also offers an up to date web page describing even more places and bargains it has really expanded my horizons about possible vacation spots that alone is worth the reasonable cost	3
1	i am not the only to think jose da silveira is not straight now that his carrer is back on track the affirmation of his gayness would be terribly damaging i believe this is the reason this yvette linton smith has been hired to go along for a while to make sure ppeople mainly women can look at him with envy and desire and continue supporting him imagine what would happen to his carrer if he turned out to be gay just your little detective susi	3

1	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nasttraveler and i'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire this magazine has articles about places not about \( as one other reviewer wrote \) articles about martinis fashion etc it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one	3

1	everything with smoothly with my magazine subscription i actually started receiving my magazines before the date specified thanks so much	3
0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting indepth coverage etc then starting about 1 2 years ago the magazine started to take a left tilt \( i do not consider myself right wing am registered as an independant but do like fair balanced coverage in my news \) since the beginning of this decline the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine the bias has also led as it always does to less in depth reporting since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent	3
0	i ordered star magazine in late december 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords she stopped receiving it in june well before her 12 month subscription expired	3
1	this is an excellent magazine there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover this is one of the few the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right they are gorgeous the writing is clear and concise and interesting the topics they write on include history travel historical objects animals places and so on one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that pictureimportant they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed \( if it is a person \) this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money enjoy	3
1	time is a fascinating magazine to read it provides insightful and enlightening news most of the time the magazine provides more balanced reporting than say newsweek i find its coverage of the wide range of issues it covers including politics the arts business and lifestyle and many other areas to be interesting and enlightening so for those looking for a weekly that is largely educative on developments worldwide then time magazine should do to those already subscribing for the magazine congratulations for making a good choice	3
1	maxim is a good magazines for adult males i enjoy all articles and their website too it is more affordable subscrition	3
1	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
1	excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives you can format partition split merge and a whole lot of other things if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software with both you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup \( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive \) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages	4
1	although i did not purchase this product from amazon com \( \) i absolutely love it the gps locator provided is amazing and better than i thought it was it is not one of those gps that updates your position every 20 seconds or something but when i zoomed in i could see my current location constantly moving on the map \( so it is updating every second \) i have ridden with deputies in my county as part of an internship and the gps provided to them is n't even this good i recommend this software and gps to anyone	4
1	this new nancy drew game was fun to play ! it was shipped on time and arrived in good condition	4
0	i guess i'm spoiled by the i spy games i 've purchased for my children this game has an enormous amount of story it 's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television interaction is confusing and frustrating i 'd rate this lower but it 's clear that a lot of work went into the animation which is top notch i just would n't classify this as a learning game	4
1	i think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning however it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program in order to get the most out of the program i feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level lesson	4
1	do n't expect to receive this by christmas even though it says in stock i ordered this on dec 14th and just received word today the 20th that it is not expected to ship until the end of january early february so if you need it for a specific occasion do n't count on it getting there in time	4
0	before using colorvision spyder2 my monitor was calibrated with the free adobe gamma program installed as part of adobe photoshop my monitor looked great and the photos i printed looked great too the colors were spot on after using spyder2 express my monitor looks worse my monitor appears dim the color temperature is too warm and colors look green and dull if i had known it was going to ruin my already great looking monitor i would n't have wasted my time my hope was that it would make my monitor look better not worse i am not at all satisfied with this product would n't recommend buying it instead try adobe gamma or look for other free monitor calibration software tools online	4
1	purchased this edition of taxcut last week on win xp2 the software installed cleanly and it downloaded the updates without any issues i imported last year 's data in less than a minute and i had my return completed in less than 1 hour this includes capital gains losses dividends and amt calculations it does n't get much easier than this yes you have to download updates the irs is still making changes to the tax codes long after this software has to be packaged and sent to the stores the alternative would be to download the whole package online when you buy it but would n't that take at least as long	4
0	i agree with reviewer mr dietz i was eager for my child to learn chess and we bought this new on amazon for 24 99 put it in and loaded it in this game is so confusing and there are no instructions at all no help menu either we wasted at least 2 hours on it before i ejected it and apologized to her there is nothing here to learn chess from	4

1	this map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike it no longer supports windows 98 which happens to be the newest op that my old lap top can use it also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years the street maps it produces are accurate except for a few minor glitches	4
1	you likely wo n't get the system performance improvement that is advertised unless you had a very messy system but it does have a great antivirus and firewall and if you like to be able to tweak hidden settings and know a bit more about what is going on behind the scenes it 's an okay product but be very careful with the cleanup tool it will delete some important files if you are not careful ! !	4
1	like the new look but am having problems making the transition jury still out	4
1	works work what cam i say i have been using microsoft products for years quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant	4
0	i found this software very difficult to use it does not have any stop or go back button the only way to exit an activity is to hit esc button to exit the program and then start all over when starting over there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and i could not find a way to skip it	4
0	i tried to use this program to file a very simple return and it calculated that i owed the state 550 for underpayment as well as a 230 penalty for late payment i tried working through the program several times to find the error i found that the program was automatically checking boxes that i had n't checked ! i have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem which i was not able to resolve in frustration i went to and filed my return easily within an hour with a 140 return from the state rather than a 780 penalty	4
0	i used version 8 of this product and decided to upgrade even though all the reviews here warned against it boy are they right this thing is terrible after installing on windows xp sp2 as soon as i started the program it crashed now every time i try to scan using my canon scanner it crashes every time product is useless wish i had of never bought it ! do not buy !	4
0	the product is so so there are others that do the same thing for a bit less but colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support you are screwed between putting you on hold for ever not calling back etc	4
0	do not waste your money ! i consider myself pretty computer savvy but this software is not easy to use you 'd have an easier time just drawing out your ideas by hand	4
0	this is the worst thing since the office assistant animated paper clip forcing the ribbon on the user assumes that the user likes icons \( i do n't what 's wrong with words \? \? \) and fills too much of the screen real estate nothing is where it should be and what arrogance on the part of microsoft to provide no alternate views no classic view just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons another oppressive giant waste of my time and money at the hands of microsoft	4
1	i am amazed what this program can do it is a big difference from ps 5 5 it is a new learning curve but well worth it what used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes amazon had the best price for me from a source i trust ordering from it is worth it	4
0	everything has been said about this product when it 's working you 're happy with my 8 version almost everything was fine with the 10 version it 's a bloody nightmare i'm giving up throwing my dazzle dvc150 to the junk and looking for another system to transfer my vhs to dvd never pinnacle again	4

1	i recently purchased this from a book club and it is a wonderful bible type is easy to read and the imitation leather binding cover is of high quality the various colors help guide you to passages of the same intent very innovative great	4
0	this program does not allow you to switch to elevation and view or alter framing details i'm only using it for a simple garage and i expected to be able to generate simple working plans with basic demensions not so you might as well pick up a copy of the sims so you could at least have some fun with it if you want to get rough ideas this might be for you but if you actually want to work from it forget it very disappointing waste of money	4
1	product was exactly as advertised and arrived in excellent condition	4
0	this is a simple drawing program much like paint do n't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover it only does black and white and it has no help in drawing manga figures and it is a stripped down program at that the documentation is for the full program so you ca n't do much of what you read in the manual and help files save your money this program is n't worth buying	4
0	do n't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates it corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you you will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software instead just follow these steps to keep your pc fast 1 run disk cleanup \( provided by xp \) 2 defrag your hard disk regularly3 clean the registry \( there are lot of free software available to clean your registry \) that 's all that you need to keep your computer fit no need to use softwares such as fix i	4

1	the product of windows xp professional is just what i was looking for with many updated features and i am looking forward in using it daily it was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it but most of all service was top knotch i could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems i may have had customer service is a plus i would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller	4
1	good product however i do n't understand why it requires lengthy updatesevery time i open the program perhaps they should try to get it right the first time and it 's impossible to tell whether the updates do anything for me using it with quicken is a pita it is unclear to me how you get more than one state	4
1	i 've only been using this program for about a month its not a simple program for me for i'm not business savvy with help of a cpa and the wonderful tutorials and help program i'm getting the program and its working so well ! i love it	4

0	obviously bogus reviews version 6 was slow as a dog so any improvement will make this more interesting of course rasing the price to 300 and 450 is less interesting what about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5 \? how bout tossing us all a bone	4
0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

1	the last reviewer did n't see any point to this software partially that 's true you do n't need it to create your photostamp you can do the same thing online however there is one big plus to the software product buying a single sheet of photostamps direct from their website costs 24 99 2 99 shipping at this writing in contrast amazon is selling this boxed version which includes a free voucher for a single sheet of stamps for seven bucks less than that do the math	4
1	drills are excellent vocabulary has good variety picking up the grammar from the application without explanation is tough for me but i guess that 's the way kids learn any language	4
1	i bought this program for my daughter for her birthday she wanted it because she 's used it at school \( 1st grade \) i was impressed by how easy it was to install i installed it as admin and she had no issues running it under her limited account \( xp pro \) i 've been impressed with what she is able to do with the program she even made valentine 's day cards for her whole class with it just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink	4
0	systemworks continues to grow taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer and i'm likely to buy an alternative next time i update note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer a new hard drive motherboard or processor and symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy i like the basic functions but there 's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore	4

1	i'm planning a motorcylce trip in italy this summer and the program gives me all the info i need on routes and sites of intertest along the way overall a great product	4
0	this software does not provide even the basic red eye fix it turns them a light shade of grey maybe it is horrible this to me renders it useless it is for the most basic of users there are no real manual functions to speak of and my free software does a better red eye and also lets me do red eye manually when they cannot detect it it has some neat functions but since it could not provide the most common need correctly i would say do not buy seller was great product is poor	4

0	i have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed norton anti virus programs i purchased the 3 pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired i then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer when i contacted norton they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full when the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers i will never purchase another norton product	4
1	i purchased elements because frankly i could n't afford the whole big adobe enchilada i have found it to be pretty intuitive lots and lots of options as to organization photo tweaking and such i have had a lot of fun messing around with the program and my digital photos i do have two other imaging programs and with the addition of elements i feel like i'm basically well set with zillions of options plus there are several web sites dedicated to digital photography and they supply free downloads of photoshop samples such as textures and so on very helpful get this if you ca n't spring for the complete photoshop program you will not be disappointed	4
1	adobe standard 8 0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions if you do research and want a better interface design and functions then you need this new version of adobe it is an incredible tool for gathering sorting copying and formatting information it also is faster than older versions see details \( above \) on amazon recommended for all information knowledge workers	4
1	photoshop is incredibly awesome ! ! ! and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program it is a must have for them however the learning curve here is extremely steep this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements	4

1	impressed with the way it clears out viruses spyware and trojans i can look at what it 's doing or just let it do it that all goes well what i do n't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign me in sites and i ca n't figure how to change this so the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful	4

0	i was excited to plan out an interior design project with this tool but ended up disappointed they definately oversell it as an interior design tool looking at the brochure online i really think they must have touched up the images because i do n't see any way that they could have created them with this product as a matter of fact the website punch interior design software package implies that they did just that the reason i do n't give it 1 star is that the video tutorial section is really great i wish all software had that	4

0	we were big fans of taxcut especially after turbo added spyware this year's tax cut has irreguarities that are costing \( \) me for example you file your college student 's return and check the box that she he will be an exemption on the head of household return then comes the surprise head of household ca n't file their return with that college student as an exemption despite checking the proper boxes ! for example it ca n't caluculate railroad retirement benefits for example it tells you that your return is a okay you pay 15 then it tells you afterward that of the glitches and wants another 15 to refile ! good bye tax cut !	4

0	first of all the many samples i viewed in browsing this software are the same object just turned different angles there are far fewer images than the number touted this is a scam in my opinion but a situation i could live with but the major issue is that most of the photo images i have searched for my actual use have very poor actually totally unusable resolution they have corrupted clarity poor pixel quality are distorted and unsuitable except for perhaps a third grader 's school project it was a complete waste of money it is headed for the first garage sale i hold and i will offer it for 50 cents with a non return policy	4

0	i hate to be rude but i have been building with frontpage 2002 for years it has so many templates and features but i thought it was time for an upgrade i am thankful that the original frontpage is still running on my laptop or i do n't think my latest sites would be up yet sorry i do n't mean to be mean it may be like other programs that you can get training or have to take a class to do the things that frontpages just does automatically i'm sure it is fine as a stand alone creator software but to call it an upgrade i do n't know	4

1	nice collection of the complete issues though of course one knows going in that the later marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story which is somewhat frustrating and the earliest years are of course somewhat crude \( heretically even the kirby artwork in the first year is \) but very nice to have in an affordable edition regardless of the flaws \( though best viewed with a large monitor	4

0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

0	this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word in addtion the micro does n't work well with ms word	4
0	i am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4 0 is a downgrade from 3 0 performance is very poor especially the organizer it 's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are such as mac iphoto and even the canon software that came with my camera compared to elements recently i 've been getting lots of crashes though everything else on my system is completely stable the only reason i gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality when it works correctly	4
1	i have used tax cut for several years have had no complaints it is easy to use and is very complete plan to use it again next year	4
1	i purchased this program simply for the encarta 2007 i was amazed at all of the wonderful features that microsoft put into the package i feel that anyone in school or not would find this program to be a useful tool in your daily life enjoy it	4
1	ca n't say enough for it there is so much good work items in it that you probably will never touch them all i 've had every updated issue from issue 5 on up they have been consistrantly excelant	4

0	i got norton ghost with my new dell pc so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive after about 6 months of 'trying' to use it i finally gave up and uninstalled it reason most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup now the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups	4
0	this product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs the tech support emailed that any cd or dvd copy software had to be removed i guess that sort of makes a dvd or cd r w drive rather pointless i removed the copy software and still have bad results about 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it maybe it does n't like my corporate virus protection i find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky i rate this product as totally useless	4
1	i have viewed pdf files for years never made one before the installation was simple and converting word excel or other files to pdf is one click away only annoying thing is the software insisting that it install toolbars everywhere but that is easily remedied	4
1	do n't listen to the whinnier if you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills this helps you must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money it is worth the effort ! i noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work i also purchased the music cd 's produced by the same company they are helpful as well i use them at work at home and in the car the brain builder booklet mentions the cd 's if you want to stop looking stupid because you ca n't remember information or you 're tired of getting lost while driving this will help you	4
1	i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles they are multi column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors in fact because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working way to go nuance	4
0	their approach might work for other languages but for chinese it 's critically important to understand the grammar of the language which rosetta stone never explains it simply displays four pictures at you with some incomprehensible \( to a beginner \) chinese near them and you have to learn to match incomprehensible words with the pictures i 've taken chinese for two years and i still found it impossible to learn anything from it i either knew the words already or i could n't learn whatever it was they were trying to teach i would be happy with just a videotaped lecture of a mandarin college course but i ca n't find anything like this for sale or free online	4

0	talk about junk ! no search capability mislabeled cds some cds wo n't run in short yuk !	4
0	the idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good but in practice zonealarm is too intrusive for most home computer users it seems to have bugs too starting with an installation that initially would n't work on one of the computers on my home lan zonealarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered i have n't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall zonealarm yet but i'm close	4

1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
1	although not perfect i 've used roxio cd dvd 6 platinum and nero 6 and returned to using this product this should also be called quot burning cd 's for dummies quot it is that easy to use i 've also used it to burn vcd 's without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you	4

0	i was a real fan of omnipage until this version the scanning speed is slug like the proof reading function has is less functional the version 14 and it tends to forget the scanner settings no noticable new features where added from version 14 and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base	4

1	i was happy enough with the function of office xp and held off upgrading for a long time what pushed me over was when i switched to using outlook as my email client accessing quite a few pop3 email accounts for various websites getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty i spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working well office 2003 's outlook comes with it 's own spam filter it works it 's simple and it 's unobtrusive the other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles but the upgrades i appreciate most are in outlook	4
0	we are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet we cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us \( i e child care \) and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs what 's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured finally the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read	4
1	i have used the hallmark card studio software for 6 or 7 years and the 2006 version is superior to the 2004 version i like having fresh cards to choose from every year or two	4
1	i have used this product for about 5 years it is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else i especially would recommend it to any small business owner	4

1	between high school and college i have studied french for three years and i had been convinced that i would starve to death in paris trying to understand the menu and to then get myself understood much of that has changed not that i am half way through the rosetta stone program my ear is now tuned to the language i have a visceral feeling for the grammar and an ability to discern tenses my vocabulary still needs to get stronger but now that i can distinguish individual words in a stream of french that is only a matter of practice with the language as advertised this program is painless and progress is rapid try the demo you 'll see	4

0	i have been a faithful mia fan for 5 years and have bought all the other games for my two kids this game is a big disappointment the language game is virtually unplayable in french i am fluent in french and went to a french language university for nine years i could barely understand what the characters were saying if this program is intended to teach kids a second language it would be more likely to turn them off the language instead this game definitely does not cater to anyone who does not already have an understanding of french	4

1	not a complicated application but it successfully repartitioned a 100g drive into 3rds on a new lenovo laptop with xp sp2 i would recommend using the dos version which you can get just by booting on the cd requires no install you can simply boot make the changes and it is done seems to be very straightforward and i would just be inherently nervous about repartitioning the boot drive with windows running	4

0	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	4

1	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint this is a great value before you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price \( full retail 150 now \) office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for 175 plus this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn also do n't worry about file formats you can re set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office	4

1	look notation software is notoriously expensive all musicians know that so when you see songwriter and its price it 's a relief everything you need is in this program i only have one complaint when adding an expressive dynamic \( p mp mf f ff etc \) you have to add one to each note to insure proper playback that is a concern of mine since i use songwriter to notate songs and export them in midi for recording purposes it leaves an ugly looking score other than that this is the best deal on the market for what it is	4
1	i have used other product of this kind and have never used any easier one the video tutorials are the greatest help of all the home plans they already have in the program are lacking but you can change them to what you want but that is not the easiest task i would recommend this product to anyone wanting to make their dreams come true	4

0	this program is limited to a few word bubbles and sound effect fonts it is difficult for a novice to understand how to get his or her own pictures into the comic the word bubble sdo not rotate so they could be pointing anywhere except where you want them to it looks really great on the cover of the cd and that 's what sold me it was a disapointing christmas	4
0	i tried unsuccessfully several times to install it i contact their alleged support they sent me what they deemed a fix the fix was awful it caused my computer to crash and print shop would never work broderbund used to be a good company but i 've had nothing but problems with their software of late they need to rethink their products their support and their company focus they are lousy at this point they obviously do n't give a dang about quality support or their customers	4

0	1 you ca n't print on anything over 8 5x14 paper useless if you want to review your house to any standard scale 2 i bought this thinking that it would be better than my 1993 version 3 0 of broderbund 3d home architect it turns out that this is exactly the same software ! i strongly recommend looking for something better	4
1	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	4
0	cakewalk s advertisement saying something like no experience needed to operate this software is in my mind mis leading at least and a down right lie at most i 've had it now for about three weeks work on it most days usually in the middle of the night so i can really concentrate on it and still cant get anything out of it all i wanted was some backing tracks for my acoustic guitar work blues pop country so far nothing and i am thinking about giving up i can operate a computer but this skill has nothing to do with this most confusing piece of junk i have ever seen beware unless your a recording engineer you probably will be disapointed	4

0	you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have do n't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it many changes are literally imposed on you like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars missing menus and the auto double space setting every time you hit return there are new features which can be helpful to some but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual	4
1	i liked the older version better i hope to get use to the new version	4
1	a good choice for newbies that love adventure games nancy drew 's games are perfect fresh relaxing but also give you a lot of thinking some times	4
0	if you read the license you find that you probably give away rights to anything you use in a comic book it also looks like you ca n't give away copies of comics you print certainly ca n't sell them and ca n't let others copy them unless you want your child 's face on a cereal box without your permission you probably do n't want this software	4

1	if you 're looking for a professional office suite ms office 2007 has no real competitors i 've worked extensively with corel office and some with open office they 're fine for the basics and they cost less but if you 're looking for effectiveness integration speedy productivity and an incredible array of tools you 'll want to buy ms office 2007 and as an added bonus the interface makes it a pleasure to work in	4
0	although crayola is a wonderful brand i was not impressed with their color wonder fingerpaints the time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them and they get frustrated it is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture also it is not mess free the paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch \( other than paper \) anyways i did not like how mushy the paint was i am still finding globs of it everywhere	5
1	vakama is very cool you must get him ! he wears the great mask of concelment and comes with a kanoka disk	5
1	my son loves this game when moving around the tracks in the one game it can be difficult the key is if you moving up or down depending on which direction you need to go push the joystick the direction once and let go after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go i hope this helps my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks mom dad and sis had to play before that the other games are a little easier but i found the games educational and my son loves it	5

0	this game was not at all what i expected the steering wheel and pedals are just for looks you actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel and many of the games had nothing to do with driving so glad i opened it to try it before christmas morning this is one toy that is headed back to the store	5
0	bought these beads for my 18 month old he enjoys taking them in and out of the container they are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together when we snapped 4 or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they 're moved	5

0	dont waste your money on this one the picture is cute but the quailty of the toy isnt any good the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child the concept is supposed to be like the game memory your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting your better off just buying the real memory game the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price	5

1	this is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year if you can find it anywhere i would highly recommend it it plays pre programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback the microphone is nice for aspiring american idols \( like my daughter ! \) and it really is pretty we did lose the dancing cinderella with prince charming but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played it also does a pretty light show i cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3 6 year old girls	5
0	this bowl is extremely cute but it does not suction to the high chair i can get it to suction to the counter and my glass table but not on my baby 's highchair so it really does n't serve the purpose it is suppose to	5

0	the truck gets clogged up often it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load the tower is decent albeit it does n't quite work as advertised as well our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way i grew up in the domino rally days and compared to the original toys these do n't stack up the truck and tower just are n't worth it you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails	5
1	i love it ! it 's really light weight and portble the batteries do go dead without the charger and the pvds should have more then 30 minutes 60minutes i like this video now alot calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it 's wonderful i hope you buy it !	5

0	bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily the level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it my only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages \( for the spiral binding \) the pages tend to be separated there so i think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength	5

1	this is a fun toy just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels you can ask which one is biggest what color is this car ask about the numbers on the cars etc that is why i think it is educational to that respect my son still has this and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along	5

1	these are really cute and a great alternative to the standard numbers and letters version of these foam tub toys my 2 and 3 year old sons enjoy playing with them no complaints here	5
1	i especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms my only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen it has a contrast adjustment but it not very helpful it also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either a great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast	5

1	every time i see my twin daughters riding these bikes around i make a promise to write a review of the product here i am fulfilling my promise they were able to pedal the bike within 2 3 days of getting them they are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that i can carry both in the back of my small car \( 89 chevy camaro \) and are light enough that i can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike the only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns	5
1	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge the only downside are some of the very small pieces definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3	5
1	this is a single player game set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic the puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated by the end the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before both kids love it ages 4 and 9 we helped the four year old learn the tricks by just asking whoes in that cars way \? then whoes in the trucks way \? until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards	5

1	my 9 year old son just started to understand this game we bought it when he was 7 he would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships he would say where his ships were this game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are it depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game	5

0	oh my gosh this is terrible ! my husband and i bought this game because i loved watching this as a child this game uses the same prizes and games over and over if you played once you have played too many times the games are boring the prizes are boring and it is a waste of money and time i do n't know why the box says 13 and up because my 10 year old daughter could play this this one is going back to the store i got zonked out of my 24 99 if you want my opinion take the cash and run	5
0	whatver your favorite fruit may be this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games it is basically boring and ill conceived i have played it a few times with my kids and found it to be of no particular interest on any level it is neither fun exciting or challenging for them or me i strongly recommend you try a cranium game or how about chess \? \? \? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game is that it 's better than tv which is n't saying much	5
1	my son received this as a christmas gift and thoroughly enjoys it this is not a regular dvd it is designed to go with the read with me dvd system \( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv \) a previous reviewer was not aware of this so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error	5
1	this game is very exciting for my son he is five i am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer i enjoy watching him do the math \( one with the coins \) as well as watching him make words	5
0	my daughter got this for her 5th birthday and it really looks cute and fun in the box within 5 minutes of playing with it the small clip that holds the starfish open broke in addition the mermaids and other pieces that come with this toy are microscopic if your kids are like mine they will lose the items and bug you all day to help them find it this toy is really cute but not worth it save yourself the hassle buy the big barbies and pretend there is a big seashell to play in	5
0	my son received this car for christmas and i was appalled amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery which was no problem getting but as for the 9 v turbo battery and charger good luck finding that i bought it when it was on sale for 19 99 and the original price said it was 59 99 so i thought that i was getting a deal huge mistake ! i did n't know that i would have to purchase an additional 20 battery no wonder why it was only 19 99 ! its a piece of junk i also got the batboat but i'm afraid to see what that might need my advice dont get it	5
1	these weebles are bigger then the ones that come with the box sets	5
0	all thomas the train products are overpriced there are too many companies out there with a better selection of wood train sets for half the price choose one of those ! save yourself some money	5
1	my 3 year old son loves this puzzle and has played with it for over a year he likes to put it together over and over again making a train across the floor it has really helped him to learn his alphabet and i highly recommend it !	5
1	we just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it ! he does n't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time the scoop and lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them overall this is a great toy for anyone who loves bob the builder we ca n't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun ! ! lego always makes great and challenging toys !	5
0	this toy is not what i had expected it is n't very durable at all and it 's hard to put together ! i do n't highly recommend it	5
1	my 3 year old is very interested in space and loves this toy having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it the payload doors do n't really close the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on meets the need for a realistic shuttle though	5
1	i have a videonow player and i luv it ! ! ! there are over 100 discs !	5
0	my son loves to drive cars i saw this and thought he would love it it is totally unrealistic doesnt make much noise \( which for some parents that would be a but in this case its not \) and it is not entertaining at all paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it and they dont seem to enjoy it either	5
0	i have bought quite a few barbies from amazon recently including the caligirl series fashion fever series and barbie loves micky mouse this barbie is quite different to all above she does not have a rubber skin like others so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts her foot is quite flat only the slippers in this package fit her all other barbies' shoes do not i guess this pooh might be made with the former generation technology	5
1	my son cannot wait to get a bigger set compared to other magnetic building sets geomags is by far better quality although it is also more expensive	5
1	my 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy it is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well they love to pretend to be rock stars ! my only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control so you only get one level loud i would recommend it for any child that likes to sing	5
0	the pixel chix 2 story house was suppose to intertwine with other pixel chix products i had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa did not work returned this item	5
1	an unexciting piece of value only to the completist collector \( like myself \) there 's nothing wrong with it it 's just that there 's nothing great about it either the lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a holographic figure hasbro could has done better by choosing another host sculpt to base this exclusive off of the phantom menace version was much better	5
1	apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered \( on time incidentially ! \)	5
0	the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet but the real promise of this kit to see a model volcano erupt may not be fulfilled we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base \( above mentioned cheap plastic sheet \) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill fitting stilts a poor experience for the kids the eruption was more of a fizzle waste of money and time	5
0	i recently purchased the deluxe version of yahtzee after enjoying the regular game for many years i was impressed with the gold dice and the dice cup everyone else in the house not playing really loves the padded cup i was disappointed in the dice tray it is very flimsy and not properly designed it should have a rotator and be made of more durable material also the score pads that came with the game do not have a place on the back to tally player totals i felt ripped off when i discovered this obvious mistake	5
1	if ya trade toon worldu can use toons as regular monsters and the it wont make yacange the other guy plays toon world it jes works for if u play itand it plays on on the opone	5

1	i was very happy with the product i purchased and i received it in a timely fashion the product was not worn nor used it was as if i bought it at the store at a lower cost it was a win win for me thank you	5
0	this is probably one of the best booster packs out there every monster that comes in the pack has an effect effect monsters can be very useful not to mention that my very first pharaonic guardian pack came with a secret rare ! that is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack ! even the common cards are great such as giant axe mummy or the gravekeeper cards ! your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack ! i highly suggest this pack	5

1	when the toa and all the first bionicles came out it was very simple and straigthforward bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad now with the pirahka we have villians claiming to be toa ! and the matoran believe them ! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon it looks really cool and can change also the little ball launcher \( i forget what it 's called \) is a lot of fun \( i shot my brother with it x3 \) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome ! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying it does n't really get in the way	5
0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 2 i agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product it is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over i still let my daughter play with it but only when she 's being supervised around it and i have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground there are other good shape sorters out there i would n't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard	5
0	bought this little cooler for the back of our atw wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well but this a totally soft sided cooler with no frame or supports so if there is anything in it the cooler does not hold it 's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon looks terrible and i would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or somethin	5
1	i received this promptly and in time for vacation was great for the kids in the car they loved the stencils that came with the board many hours of fun they like that they can make skid marks with the lightning mcqueen car	5

1	my daughter \( age 13 \) really enjoyed this game it provides more options than scrabble which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that	5
0	my daughter loves this toy she has the treehouse and the school house she plays with them often my only complaint is that they fall apart she does not mind i just snap it back together and she keeps playing	5
0	this tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children my son who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn it would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard forget it this is an on pavement toy only	5
1	this toy is so cool ! i use it all the time with my friend erica you could text message each other and it even takes pictures my parents bought it for me at christmas they were happy because they did not have to pay a phone bill or for minutes ! this toy is so cool ! now i do not have to beg my parents for a real cell phone ! ! ! i highly recomend for any one who is reading this to get this toy !	5
0	this item is really small i did n't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item in hindsight i would n't have order it had i paid more attention i think the other products from haba \( eggs and teabags \) are worth the money for the size	5
0	our daughters are four and five years old the skates will not fit over our five year old 's shoe the ad clearly says three to seven years old	5
0	my cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces however she can not even use the gift you need to buy the totally beadifully jewelry maker to use this kit no where in the online description of this toy on amazon does it tell you this toy is being returned b c we do n't have the bead maker	5

0	this pirate chest is a total rip off the chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal when i ordered it as a gift for someone they sent me someone else 's order then refused to let me return my item for a refund when i finally received it the company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all	5

0	my son was excited to get this for christmas after we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed the arrows launcher never held the arrows as soon as you tried to load them they would fly out the shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use he pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it 's gathering dust in our closet	5
1	my 5 year old daughter got this monkey when she was little and has slept with it every night since my 1 year old daughter loved her big sister 's monkey so we had to get her one of her own she loves it and sleeps with her monkey every night now	5
0	we got this set for my 4 year old son for christmas his eyes lit up when he saw it he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away we did n't of course we waited a whole day thank goodness it literally took an hour to put together there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different it was very frustrating then it would n't stay together once it was finished it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since he gets so upset when he tries to play with it we saved the box it 's going back if they will take it	5
1	this is a great simple fast game that is fun for all ages	5
1	my 9 year old son loves dragon mountain he was n't able to assemble it alone eventhough he 's typically very good at assembling most other toys it took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together	5
1	the fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child she had a great time using her magic wands to see what would happen with the bathroom playset having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool \( i assume so dora could step up to the sink brush her teeth \) pops out was a very fun surprise my 7 year old has already spent many hours making up princess stories with the castle the whole set was a great buy	5
1	it is a little smaller than i expected but i guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand other than that it 's perfect my son 's room has an atlanta braves theme so the colors are perfect the main reason i bought this was to use as a toy box so far it 's worked out great ! i do n't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small do n't bother me the only thing i have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank	5
1	we had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one my girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make the music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them \( ages 20 months and 3 1 2 \)	5
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew the versitility of this one looks great well i liked it more than either one of my children did as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that it just got taken apart and lost its interest no matter which way i arranged the peices infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads	5
0	i purchased two of these hand held deal or no deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys the boys found that they had trouble indicating that they 'd like to take the deal when the pressed the button to say yes to the deal the game continued as if they said no deal they got annoyed but kept on playing i tried the game thinking that they did something wrong but i also had the same problem i'm annoyed because the game was 20 each and i think it does n't work properly !	5
0	ok as far as novelty goes these ducks are soooo funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky ! ! ! i bought them for my 1 year old just because i am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky anyone who feels this lil duck toy is devil worship to has some serious issues and i would suggest they need to seek some professional help so for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because i think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight	5
0	got a very similar model at a babies r us several months ago but without the adult 's handle my son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself and we generally like the style but the trike tips so easily that i rarely take it out for him to use never would have thought to check this but i 'll be in the market for a big wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model	5
0	what a super cheap rip off of the original rubik 's cube that was introduced to us in the mid '70 's seems like every doctor 's office break room friend 's basement etc had one of these cubes to kill time with main reason that i personally did n't like this modern version was that after the first day or two the colored stickers start to peel off the rubik 's cube had it 's day in this high tech age i cannot see many kids having any interest in this item they might actually have to 'use' their brain please do n't bring back the pet rock	5
0	this love ball was very un lovely the messages would not appear clearly in the window no matter how i tried turning it over different ways maybe it sat too long in the wrong environment before i received it i put it back in the box and plan to ship it back	5

0	these were a gift to my 5 year old from his grandmother i ca n't return it to her since it would make her feel worse than the worthless product i'm amazed amazon carries them ! a string and two cans would work better	5
1	my two year old has several of these cars and the race track he loves all things cars so these were a big hit all of the shake and go cars talk before they run which he especially likes they are very easy for a toddler to operate but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them too they do n't run for very long per shake but that does n't seem to bother him at all	5

0	this is fun and a good idea but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor it fell apart the first time we had it up and while you can put it back together unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds it is n't worth it the keyboard itself is fine the microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it but the keyboard does the microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away i would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead or if you buy this product do n't expect to use the keyboard stand for long but it can work without it	5
0	this school bus was smaller than i expected about 4 inches long i bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses he broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package it 's a pull back and go car and he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels they were wobbly from then on this toy is not for kids and it 's not really for playing with from what i can tell very dissappointed	5
0	i never imagined i was going to be such a bad experience when you start the game is almost lost for the ones that chosen the light side then the game is complicated and it is not balanced so everybody will choose the dark side because they have advantages dont waste you money buying this game better buy the normal risk acquire or axes and allie	5
0	i bought this toy last year for me son he really did not care for the toy at all but he loves elmo the crayons were way too messy and melted really fast	5
0	this paint brush globs out the paint does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up i am so disappointed	5

1	this is a good toy for a toddler not a baby i 've used this toy in two different setting \( first as a nanny and then as a mom \) and both times the babies were terrified of it it 's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old the balls fly everywhere and you 've got to run about after them to keep it going unless of course you 've got a toddler then they can run about after the balls \( which seems to be half the fun for them \) good toy but not until maybe 14 months	5
1	bought this one recently for my eight year old \( and myself \) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it more challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games i highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing thinking spatially understanding the consequences of a move or moves and introducing the concept of strategy	5
1	i received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it the price is great right now especially with free shipping she loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories more than worth the low price i'm going to stock up on a few more for misc gifts the package is large and comes with a lot of accessories	5
0	what a disaster it takes too long then you get a tiny gross little blob of cotton candy it is quite a mess to clean then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed my 5 year old wants to know how santa 's elves made such a stinky bad toy expect to be disappointed with this one	5

0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me my boys took one look at it and threw it i thought it was much bigger than what it is i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children	5
1	my son received these when he was 7 months old and we are loving them ! they 're adorable and chunky and work great on carpets or hard floors they 're easy for little hands to hold on to and a couple of them rattle when my nephews come over they always find these and they 're 5 and 7	5
0	my 4 yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas and santa was kind enough to bring it for her the quality is fine but it just does n't do much she played with it for the first day and has touched it maybe twice since i 've seen these on clearance everywhere i 've gone lately too if your child is into playing mommy this is cute but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks does n't really equate to lasting play value with this one	5
1	i love light sabers i got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play i bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool this saber is the best you can fight and the saber will not get damage i like it very much i got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight the light saber full extended is like 3 4 of a meter but it do his job the electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment the force be with you	5
0	i am not too happy with this item it has a handle yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot it is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out and the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use other than that it is attractive looking and constructed well	5
1	i was happy to order this early so they would n't run out but i later saw the same set at a local store there was only one left on the shelf so i'm glad i ordered them anyway they are my youngest son 's favorite cars to start off with every morning	5

1	it takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game but once learned it is a lot of fun a good game for four players and a great game for six players it generates lots of lively action with the bidding for the cards we played this game on a cruise with four strangers they were no longer strangers after the game everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it that 's how we got it bought the game after playing with family	5

0	i support the comments that others make this game is so poorly designed it is laughable i cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once forget trying to follow the directions they left out many important rules the board does n't work especially the way the pieces fit into it and what a terrible ending with a spinner that does n't even work like a spinner what is up with that \? forget this game	5
0	compared with the sound sensation blocks i bought together to my 3 month babies this product is almost ignored by them	5
1	we purchased this set for my son christmas 2003 he loves it the age range on the listing is off though it should be the same for any of the little people toys 12 or 18 months and up there are no small parts highly recommended and fun during the holidays or any time	5
1	we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1 and 2 year old children it 's intended for children a little older and i can see why as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps however my 2 year old can use it by herself and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys i had to hold it in place for my 1 year old but when doing so it also allowed him to color i would recommend it especially for children 3 and up	5

0	the pieces of this toy \( the outfits etc \) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet also the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing in general this toy is hokey and cheap i recommend melissa and doug 's magnetic dress up and ormagnetic princess dress up all the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together also the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized	5

1	my daughter really wanted this for christmas she really has played and played with it ever since i wish that it came with some dry erase markers for the board in it but other than that we have been very pleased with the product	5
0	hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it easily assembled up within 60 seconds i have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground there was no rope or stakes with the purchase i am unaware if these should have been included two entrances into the hideaway the front inverted t entrance is great however the rear is a porthole type entrance not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom material not that durable but with care there should be no issues a lot bigger than it looks on the site which was a nice surprise	5
0	big disappointment cheaply made t rex model does not snap together can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded microscope less functional than a magnifying lens volcano is ok the plaster does work but you must provide ingredients for the eruption weather center very very flimsy and breaks i was quite surprised a name like smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product supplies for crystals subpar for what is required was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons	5
0	i got this puzzle for my three children \( age 5 4 and 2 \) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked it requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds so removing one means it does n't work the pieces are small enough that i was n't very worried about choking but why buy a toy which makes you worry \? we were really disappointed	5
0	this game was not engaging my son did not find it interesting he has not asked to play with it again you push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself if you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance try what 's gnu it is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults	5
1	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products	5
0	very dangerous ! my daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike the handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over there is only one good thing about it the seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going this helped my daughter learn to pedal the constant nose dive however was not worth it do n't buy !	5
0	no wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks it does not work and the quality is sub par i have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst i have seen do not take if it was free garbarge and disappointment await i gave one star because you have to but i would give negitive stars if i could	5
1	i love this playpen ! ! durable plastic can be extended to larger size \( or shortened if going someplace that is not as large \) only problem is that my baby loves to wander she is not thrilled when mommy cages her up in order to protect her while i make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary crib toys can be safely attached on the sides \( did that with her aquarium toy which she loves and it soothes her \) occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her i just put her other toys in for her to play with	5
1	i received this sudoku handheld for christmas as a gift i started to get into sudoku a few months ago while i still like to clip out the newspaper clipping this handheld lets me take my growing gaming addiction on the go there are n't many buttons so it 's pretty intuitive on what to push to make it work hope this helps	5
1	this thing is great anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off it will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them funny funny funny ! ! ! ! you can use fairly light objects you can use trip cords and you can use trip cord like devices too and probably much more that i have never thought of good luck good fun and good hunting ! sam kochel p s hope this was a helpful review	5

0	i purchased this for my eight year old niece we were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer the program takes up a lot of memory on your computer 's hard drive	5

0	i brought this because my kids love spongebob ice cream perfect toy right \? wrong ! the ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob 's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone we have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then i have a huge mess left in the kitchen	5
0	my daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday she loves tub toys but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water my daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it quot swim quot on the floor i'm a big fan of sassy toys but i 'd pass on this one	5
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play this was how i learned how to play the game i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above \( 90 's style \) unfortunately they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me	5
1	imaginext dinosaurs' t rex is quite simply fun to play with the dinosaur not only is a great toy with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar it comes with a catapult with its respective stones \( 2 \) that the caveman \( also included with accessories \) can operate to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino my 3 year old picked it up since he got it and he has n't let go	5
1	i found that for the price this set was great ! it comes with one rascus figure and one shadow knight the catapult is very orginal and powered by a rubber band i got it to go 3 and a half feet there were also some improvements in the pieces for example the flagpole was less annoying the weapons were improved and the head pieces came on and off much smoother whether you are starting lego castle or are an expert builder this is great set	5
0	i bought this for my boyfriend as a present we both love the tv show and thought the game would be as exciting \( without the live crowd of course \) but the game moves slow no models only picking case numbers you can compete against one another but its not really exciting maybe you should try the board game version it ca n't be any worse	5
1	we all love this toy what i like about it is that it 's easy to use even for my almost three yr old it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious it 's sturdy \( will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard \) it looks good not cheap and it 's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes this has been the big hit this christmas even more so than tekno puppy	5
0	when i received the punching nun and removed her from the package her halibut fell off the glue holding her black cape on did n't hold either i would n't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up	5

0	this game fell apart after we got out of the box i did n't even get a chance to play this with my five year old before it fell apart be careful i would n't get this if you have children who are rough on their toys	5
1	my three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection we did n't use it as a game you can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them yes the frosting wo n't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play ! box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue would buy this again great for kids with imaginations	5
0	we went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water adding the package of sea monkeys and finally feeding the sea monkeys and nothing happened \( \) hope these are not dead	5
0	this elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night i had to ship the first one back to fp on my own dime to get a new one that one was broken as well ! the cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the abc part does not work this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on ! what a pain ! shoddy electrical work i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat make sure you get this garbage on sale !	5
0	quick shipping on product but the product was not what i was hoping for the snow was much grainer than i had expected i had seen what i thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that instant snow was very fine and really looked like snow this product does n't look much like snow and does n't have the same texture	5
1	this game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations the luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn all in all this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it	5
1	this is a great game ! using clues to get others to say the secret word another great classic game brought back by endless ! a	5

0	i ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for valentines day upon receipt it was not operable the user is supposed to ask the love ball a question and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window the answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid	5
0	not only did this phone not work but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes the only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up the flashing light was distracting and its features were extraordinarily limited ! the camera option did n't work at all and where the heck was the texting \? \? \? my parents bought this phone for me for my birthday and it really made me mad ! ! i can see that this might be a good starter phone but you can only get 0 calls froim it and really limited reception in the mountains switch to a razr as soon as possible	5
1	the only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug other than that this toy is simply adorable the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable and the sounds it makes are truly neat my daughter got this over a year ago \( she is 7 now \) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs	5
0	even though i purchased this watch for my grandson for christmas from another store it was not worth the money it does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it i picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night i did see on one toy store 's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better i wish i had known that before i spend 10 on this piece of junk	5
1	whenever we take this bike to the park boys and men of every description crown around it in awe my son who is seven and so far not athletic at all loves the recognition not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching we just wish it came in an adult size	5
1	this train table is a nice size bigger than i expected it went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson 's thomas stuff it seems to be made as well as what i saw at toys r us for double the price	5
1	my 9 month old received this for christmas and loves it ! he is not quite crawling yet he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy so far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze the voice and phrases it says are so very cute too we love the little giggle and when it says hello baby ! ! this is an adorable toy	5
0	this product is terrible the very essence of su doku is logic reasoning this product leaves everything to guesswork i returned it ate the postage was happy to be rid of it ! i then downloaded shareware from the palm store to my palm pilot for 10 could n't be happier	5
1	another nice product from playdough worth the ten bucks or so we just bought this fromamazon this would make a cute birthday present for a young child say 2 to 8 \? hard to give an age as i myself like to sit with my son and play ! enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage i would buy this again as a gift	5
0	i got this toy with my own money and i think i wasted it bigtime ! i play with the products more than the store i think it should have been bigger and come with more stuff i nd not have had all that crap painted on the card borad backs to the shelves and i think it should had come with plastic strong backs instead of card borad stuff i uassly take out the card borad backs and make the store be a grocery store i would not buy this toy i would by the nursery playset instead im 11 yrs ol	5

0	complete waste of money ! i bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it ! after several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed now the darn thing does not respond to her answers even when i clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register complete waste of money ! ! ! ! would not recommend to anyone ! save your money and play with a rock much more fun	5
1	a lot of fun ! the kids really enjoy this updated version of their favorite game product was shipped promptly !	5
0	i would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 1 2 years \( unless small for their age \) my 4 yr old son \( 36lbs \) got it for his birthday and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes there is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car but its been parked since broken i wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted the plastic seems cheaply made the voice buttons and noises are loud and work well stickers have already started to flake peel off after 1 month consider a bigwheel	5
0	this is a very cute and realistic set the measurements are all accurate the whisk is very dangerous though it is metal one of the things came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon one of the kids could have been severely injured had i not found it and thrown it away if you buy this item make sure get rid of the whisk !	5
1	my 2yr old got this one and another imaginext dinosaur for christmas and this one is by far his favorite he loves attaching the cart to the mammoth and moving them around the reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy when you think it 's pushed down all the way you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise also like the last reviewer i think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean but overall the toy is fun and very durable	5
0	again the graphics are horrible the mat is boring and not colorful my 3 1 2 yr old had a hard time matching the colors on the tv to the ones on the mat b c they are so faded she used it once and it has been sitting in the corner ever since complete waste of money	5
0	the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play	5
0	i am very disappointed in the construction of this toy the picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material it was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it 's made of i have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next christmas i would have sent it back if it had not been from santa	5
1	this chart has been an excellent way for our children to track their daily progress towards completing their weekly chores and an excellent way to begin the work for allowance process only draw back there really is n't enough room to track chores for more than one child	5
0	i purchased crazy croc even after reading all the bad reviews but my son really wanted it so i bought it for him for christmas anyway it was the worst gift i 've ever bought please do n't even waste your money trust me check the reviews first now that 's worth it	5
0	my 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times our version did not include the 5 ways to play as stated on the box \( i 've requested a copy from briarpatch \) my 4 year old who received the gift lost interest after the first time he played both of my boys love the i spy and can you see what i see books this game just was n't challenging enough for them	5
1	yesterday we where buying the christmass presents when i saw there was the big air towel at 40 bucks so i said to my mother if i could buy so she said yes when i got home i began building it after 6 hours i finished it and when i tried everything was going all right so it was n't that difficult	5
0	i bought this for my 7 year old son it did not take long before the a and b buttons became stuck in the down position the games were not that challenging for a 7 year old but he thought it was great when the a and b buttons fouled up he said it made it more of a challenge dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap	5
0	i received my order today and discovered \( as with all of the hasa products in my order \) that although more than one item is pictured only one comes with the order the item itself is very small 2 1 2 x 1 that fine i can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood lifesize would make play a work out for most children however shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for one item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising	5
0	gave this heli to my 30 year old son on his birthday it was supposed to be easy to fly it rolled over and crashed inches off the ground on its maiden flight spewing propeller parts everywhere with all retailers out of replacement parts it may never fly if you buy this heli do n't buy it through the mail or online but from a local dealer with parts and expertise to help you get it back together	5
0	i purchased the havoc heli for my dad he saw an ad for it on tv and wanted one so i was excited that amazon com had it for a lower cost and free shipping however that was as far as the good went my dad was disappointed to find out that not only could the havoc heli not pick up and fly with the accessories that came with it but it had a difficult time flying without any extra weight this helicopter has no risk of creating any havoc but it does make a cute little paperweight	5

0	i cannot believe radio flyer put this bike out ! every single time my 2 year old got on this thing it toppled over ! i actually called radio flyer they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model \( then i found out there are plenty of angry parents out there ! \) after some resistance they agreed to refund me and they did the back wheels are too close together making it very easy to tip over plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable i tried it too in the store on smooth ground but on the sidewalk forget it ! please save yourself the trouble !	5
1	this toy is great for many reasons ! ! tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters you get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers ! each character has point value and rarity if you 're lucky you might get one of the very rare tengamos and sell it for on ebay ! you can also play hundreds of games with the tengamo magnet special design and little steel ball that comes in the pack hurry to collect all of series 1 before it is retired for series 2 highly recommended	5
1	my infant just likes the crinkly fishy that comes with the buckets i'm sure she will grow into this toy i do wonder how i'm going to keep the felty material clean especially when she starts putting these things to her mouth	5
1	if you know the movies inside and out this game is fun for the dedicated fan i play with my son that knows so much more star wars trivia than i do but find the game enjoyable the only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times the dvd portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck not sure why they could not load up more questions on the dvd but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old mom that answers so many questions wrong	5
1	my son calls this a flute and rather than argue we let it go but his little hands have a hard time holding it \( he 's 4 \) even i have trouble i'm right handed and the right hand keys are on the bottom i do n't know if that 's how real clarinets are but it 's awkward also your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play so that 's also a little frustrating but the sound is great and it 's fun to play once you get the hang of it	5
1	the checkbook package was opened no pieces were missing but it was hard to glue the plastic to the cardboard to give it as a christmas gift	5
0	this playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child 's imagination my son received this as a christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater but a house cave secret hideout restaurant and schoolhouse very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills ! the only downside i have with the theater is that it is not very durable the theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws etc it slides together and a child can easily disassemble it the front panel that the child rest 's his her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater other than the durability factor great product	5
1	i bought this item for my husband for xmas and he loved it but once they were all put together they would fall apart fairly easy but other then that they are great i highly recomend this especialy for a husband or son	5

0	these rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition however the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see after we opened the cards \( two sets were purchased \) we found that the rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside down the cards are also not particularly sturdy these cards appear to be irregulars	5

1	the kit was great i thought it was soo much fun to paint the puppies different colors ! this toy is really cool because you can hang your puppies put magginets on them or just play with them ! this toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break if you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one	5
0	i bought this barbie after seeing two pictures of angel barbies on the website and reading the manufacturer 's description one picture seems to have been deleted now the manufacturer 's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash i trusted that the manufacturer 's description which matched one of the pictures was the correct angel the doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all it is very simple with vinyl wings be aware of which you are purchasing the description is deceptive and incorrect	5
0	i thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection i was wrong it does n't work ! ! ! ! we tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no mountain of bubbles this product does n't work save your money ! !	5

1	this is the toy with the background music and she 'll play the croc toy along with this one and also dance	5
0	all the cut shapes are the same so it 's very easy for my 3 1 2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place the pieces also seem thin and flimsy the coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox carrycase all in all the quality is much less than i expect from ravensburger the ravensburger thomas giant floor puzzle \( 24 pc \) is a far superior product but no longer complex enough for my kid	5
0	this trike in useless ! our 2yr old tips over every time she tries to ride it buy something that 's worth the money and safer ! now our daughter wo n't go near the thing or any other trike ! i expected much better from radio flyer	5

1	muffet vs spider ! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene again the turn is to the s m pink black leather bondage look similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it 's a great display piece the downfall from five stars is that when setup muffet is almost obscured by the spider both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	5
0	this is a very cute set however it 's not very well made and the holders are free standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over in regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you do n't have that problem with kids the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue i would n't buy this set again if i had it to do over disappointing	5
1	my family loves this game because there are several different games you can play with it and it goes along with the book so the kids like to compare it this product is very durable and will last	5

0	this thing just does n't work do n't bother it wo n't stay upright no matter what you do so there 's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it looks like it would be fun if it worked the most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason	5
0	i am a seamstress who knows how to sew and how to thread both top and bobbin threads my daughter received this machine for christmas we threaded it according to directions it sews about 10 stitches then jams i observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing and leads to a jam every time do n't disappoint a child by purchasing this	5
0	this item had a description for ages three and up this is n't even close now i'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five year old who is so attached to the fact it 's a batmobile he can get in even if his knees practically knock at his chin that i 'll never pry it from him he 's only going to be able to even get in it for probably two more months it was a complete waste of money it 's suited for two to three year olds and small four year olds	5
0	do n't waste your time with this thing by the time we invested in the toy the batteries etc we had quite a few dollars into it for about 15 minutes of fun the toy ca n't just be set down on a table so when my son actually gone bored with it \( to my shock because he loves bubbles \) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining gold solution all over yuck mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash this toy is just a gimmick stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money	5
1	my 6 year old loves this yes it is small but who wants a big toy around the house this can go right on a shelf when not being played with i would get it again if i did not already have it	5
0	this vehicle is nothing but junk it does not move well on the driveway and does not move on the grass at all my grandson uses his feet to push it which is not what i expected from a 100 00 toy very disappointed i would like to send it back for a full refund	5
0	my daughter \( 3 at the time \) received this as a christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game the game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs \( 24 total pieces \) i would avoid this game entirely	5
1	i have been in love with this game ever since i first played it was a favorite at choir parties over the holidays in chicago since i have moved i keep one copy at my permanent address and another at my vacation home it is great for all ages we are very loose with the rules and find teams the most fun it does n't matter who wins as long as we play play play we laugh laugh laugh !	5
0	after waiting for 1 month to get this toy i cannot tell you how disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it absolutely this thing is a waste of money ! it is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it the image is impossible to see with any amount of detail do not buy this toy ! i would give it zero stars if i could	5
1	this is a perfect game that you can enjoy with the whole family ! it is very fun and great for little ones too ! i own this game and my family enjoys it very much this is a great mystery game where you spy to find out each pearson 's idenity i love this game and i think you would too	5
1	my son absolutely loves his animals he can sit and play with the book for awhile he 's 20 months old and knows where each picture belongs it was a great gift and i recommend it ! i do agree with the other reviews regarding the dinosaurs	5
1	i like the set up it looks like a daycare really appears it is great to spur on your childs creativity and role playing skills	5
1	this is a great item theres alot going on in such a tiny little space the detail is great from the kraken that can make a boat disappear to the bone cage there 's a collapsing bridge a collapsing building a trap door runaway mill and a cool magnetic boat race and more it comes with jack will norrington and the cannibal chief but no davy that was a little disappointing but anyway its a fun item for all ages	5
0	the board for this game is a pain half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick it takes forever and a day to look in the book locate the letters' locations and uncover them too i love wheel of fortune but you 're better off playing a computerized version where you do n't have all the hassle	5
1	not only will this be a fun gift for our 5 year old grandson it will be a fun gift for our 65 year old brother in law ! quite realistic looking ! it works great on smooth surfaces but does n't do well on carpet our dogs got a big kick out of it	5
0	i popped in the batteries and was unable to get any sound whatsoever i even put in a different set up batteries still no dice this is the worst excuse for a keyboard ever i am sorry that i will be pitching this in the trash and it will take up space in a landfill after the reading the other reviews perhaps i am fortunate that this clunker never even made a sound i gather that i'm not missing much	5
1	first i have to say thank you to amazon for having this game this was on my daughter 's christmas list and amazon was the only place i could find it second my daughter loves this game and so do her friends they have played the game more than any other she received	5
1	we wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06 we bought a lot of m d toys and this by far was the better of their toys even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out like other said the sound is very appropriate i like this toy and definitely recommend this to others the only reason i gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful	5
1	you might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 optimus prime toy \( or wanted a trailer for the truck \) but this is an updated version of the original character as opposed to a remake and is superior in many ways it is durable detailed well articulated and fun especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot i 'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike	5
0	ho ho ho ! ! my 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it he 's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it we 've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work the only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again \( if you know how to turn the sound off let me know i'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire \) do not buy this toy you 'll be very disappointed in it	5
1	we purchased this game for our son for christmas he is a chess lover and we wanted to get him something a little different chaturanga was perfect since it is the precursor to chess he has enjoyed the game all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition it is an attractive box we are very pleased with every aspect of it	5
1	transaction went well grandkids are having a blast at using the product innovatively with lots of fun and excitement	5
1	the v4 the newest american tamagotchi is much like its previous japanese counterparts the entama and uratama this tamagotchi goes to school interviews for jobs and then has a career each career has its own game so there are many more games on this tama than the v3 there is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail	5
0	i bought this basketball hoop for my son who was two and loved to shoot hoops great height for a small kid but difficult to adjust latch always got stuck also after a few months the latch broke right off now i have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son now it is just a 30 peice of trash	5
1	i appreciate the previous reviews but we had already gotten the game by the time i read them my family ages 4 6 10 and three adults playing really enjoyed this game we played until we had a winner \( not too long \) and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner just our opinion but we had a good time	5
0	i bought it for my son to use with the original pixter also and i found what it was compatible with after i realized that it did n't work with the original pixter the box i have says down in the bottom right corner \( if the back of the box is facing you \) of the back of the box in tiny print compatible with pixter plus and pixter 2 0 you would think they would put that on the front	5
1	i bought this toy because amamzon 's price was a great bargin compared to other stores i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way there is a lot more room for more logs 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front i ended up buying additional logs \( not lincoln logs \) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence	5
0	we were really excited about this item but have been very disappointed we followed the directions exactly even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks \( which was frustrating and a pain in the neck \) and still we have nothing growing after weeks and weeks of waiting ! rotten thing to do to a kid ! the plastic dome is of decent quality and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller worked out much better this is a total waste of time and money unfortunately	5
0	my 5 1 2 year old son received this for christmas he loves pirates and legos so it seemed a perfect fit we were wrong ! the mega bloks are poorly made and it 's very difficult \( even for an adult \) to get the pieces to stay together imagine how frustrating this is for a child we will never purchase mega bloks products again we 're sticking to the original legos ! nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration thanks megabloks	5
1	when i ironed my 14m son wanted to play with it he helps with the house cleaning i bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch sprays water and pretend buttons he loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet we play iron with the water when i have time this is one toy that i can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time sigrid manon blake ramire	5

1	it 's amazing how much a child learns by having access we are an american family living in germany and felt my 5 year old would have a greater understanding of where we live and where our extended family lives	5
0	this kit is very poorly detailed and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close there 's a much better model of an x wing out there do a web search for a company called fine molds it 's a japanese company that makes a finely detailed 1 72 scale x wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures including parts to build different ships from the original film 's death star battle including standing seated pilot figures different droid types it 's a bit more expensive than this kit but you get what you pay for	5
0	our family loves all types of memory games and this is the most attractive the colorful stripes on the back are great the pictures are good the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity in fact i would like to know this myself	5
0	i bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the dollar tree when i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures i decided to give them a try i have two complaints with this product one the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and i could'nt get one of the phones to communicate the pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone	5
1	my son received this one as well as the other colorfelt toy he was not impressed with it in regards to playing with it on his own it does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together	5
0	why should i buy anything from amazon when they allow price gouging by third party retailers	5
0	this jack in the box is pretty flimsy not worth the price would have returned it but it would have not been worth the expense	5
0	cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review i am extremely disappointed the sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around it is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly i just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from crayola	5
1	love this game with family and or friends it 's one of the best card games around it is easy and does n't require a lot of attention \( you can watch movies talk hang out etc \) yet keeps your interest it 's also a game people of many ages can play because it 's not too difficult a good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame	5
1	it says some silly things which might not make us laugh but overall a cute toy and kids will like i	5
1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey there are no other ones like it they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth they love it	5
0	this is a horrible edition of this game it has a limited amount of games and it does n't play like the tv game at all save some money and buy the old boxed editions from or get the newest version you 'll like it a lot more	5
0	i bought this for my son 's first birthday he loved it ! but after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it he still plays with it a little bit but not like when it made noise i would n't have wasted my money if i had known the batteries would only last a month	5
0	this was given to my 2 year old as a present it is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart the roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with the concept is good all the animals and farmer are built very well but it 's frustrating to me and my son that it wo n't stay together	5
0	i love legos however i too was not real impressed with the 50th anniversary tub the lego com websites description of the contents each bucket includes lego system bricks in your favorite lego colors plus a handful of gold colored bricks ! let 's be real we 're talking a child 's handful not adult my daughter was lucky enough to get 8 gold bricks in her bucket another child i know got 4 his brother 5 the duplo set i bought had 6 if you 're buying for the gold bricks it 's not worth the money	5
1	this is a great lego set my 1 1 2 year old son loves them he crashes the truck and caravan all the time and they never break he really likes the bob and cat that come with it these are also the right size to use with the bob click brick sets this truck fits in to the parking thing with the talking click brick trucks	5
1	this was ordered for our 4 year old she just loves it ! very realistic features size of set quality is why fisher price is still the very best for imaginations of all ages ! !	5

1	for scrabble aficionados with children who often travel long distances by plane this game is a must travel accessory	5
1	lots of fun for young children my kids ages 2 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set the only negative is that there are n't very many pieces if more than one child wants to play at a time you will need more sets	5
0	i recieved the car and set it up according to the manufacturers instructions and it did n't work ! i contacted the manufacturer and they mailed me a shipping return label and i returned it to them i am awaiting a new or fixed car back from them	5

1	got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she played with well more like laid and stared at now she 's 4 1 2 months old and she still loves it she loves to grab at the fish shake the rattle and twirl the lobster for awhile it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom music is n't too annoying either	5
1	this is a quality product good detail holds air well ready to blow up and hang from attached loop an excellent buy	5
0	a torture device disguised as a toy how would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell \? might as well go lick some dirty socks i think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash hey ma why does slinky go down but not up \? who 's the genius who found this at the scrapyard \? most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind 's perverse craving for repetition and or irritation	5
1	i originally bought this monkey on vacation i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it how could i not buy it for him doing that \? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house so now i do n't have to drag it from house to house as he gets older he is liking it more and more	5
1	this large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the classic collection children of all ages \( and adults \) can build ships planes houses whatever the mind imagines in a variety of colors the bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage while lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character this is a great product	5
1	i bought this mostly for the container i had individual play doh products like the barber set that came in it 's own box i'm able to put all play doh things into this container and everything is in one spot no more boxes and sorting i even still have space for more things like different colors and everything my daughter loves the variety of the toys and i love the convenience i'm going to buy it for presents for other families i know !	5
0	my 7 year old saw the ads for digidraw and drove me absolutely crazy until christmas rolled around last year the look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short lived it was nearly impossible to assemble the time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old the only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils	5
0	our son received this toy for his first birthday it has a lot of good features teaches colors numbers farm animals and their sounds several songs but the music is awful the singer is off key on every single song \( either that or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice \) as someone who appreciates music i cannot tolerate listening to this especially since there are far better toys out there since our son already has 2 leapfrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy \( the learning table which has much better quality music and the fridge farm \) we will be exchanging the vtech discovery nursery farm for a different toy	5
0	my 4 year old really wanted this for christmas after looking at similar products we chose this one should have spent the money on the one w the dvd tutu is way too small fits her 18 doll mat is a little too sensitive she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads only 2 instructions feet up feet down on the other arms up arms down bar is n't very stable company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat my daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it	5
1	my 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it he plays with it just about everyday everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too they all love trying to make baskets the flaws are that it is loud and i wish the baseball and football did more or made noise they do n't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises overall it 's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained !	5
0	game did n't work but amazon was very accomodating with a refund including shipping	5
1	we had a simpler and earlier quercetti marble run this was an upgrade add on and well worth it the motorized elevator keeps the action going a five year old will need help setting up but can operate the final run easily safe pieces easy construction and good directions fun even for the adults	5
1	the doll looks nothing like the aidan in the movie actually his face is kind of funny looking the movie aidan is cuter the doll could definitely have been made better	5
1	my daughters love this supermarket checkout ! they 've had it for a few months and have n't lost interest i would recommend it for any child who likes to play pretend the quality is what i expected works fine	5
0	followed all directions added fish within hours the fish were sleeping on the bottom of the tank luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so i took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water added fish 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better something is seriously wrong with this tank bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what they are doing great ! do not put fish in the shark tank they will die	5
0	this marble maze looks so fun and cute however it 's actually useless and incredibly frustrating the pieces do n't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them much less when you try to roll a marble through them also the configurations pictured on the box do n't work at all either our giraffe is missing a critical piece or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate ugh i'm returning this immediately	5
1	awesome music and interaction fun storage compartment under seat and blocks that fit into the sides and play wonderful songs gets the kiddo very involved transitions well from indoor toy to riding outside	5
0	i agree with the other reviews my four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift none of the pieces stay together at all how do you explain why the gate wo n't hold together why the horse wo n't stand up why the barn doors keep falling off and what do i say to the gift giver when they see it	5
0	although my 3 1 2 yr old loves this belt it barely fits him it only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go in fact my 1 1 2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro the smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face my son loves it for the brief time it sort of fits him but i am disappointed with the quality and the size	5
1	if you are not a literature professor or do n't read everything that the library gets in you will probably find this game extremely difficult on the other hand you now have a book list	5
0	the barbie plug and play 12 dancing princesses thing is a joke my daughter only wanted that for christmas for three months after the one on christmas morning did not function at all the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days the graphics are straight from 1981 and the dancing princesses even make roboty bendy noises as they move very strange and disappointing	5
1	satisfied with the overall quality of the product also with the purchase process	5
1	makuta is sooooooo cool ! i love his giant staff pitchfork i think he is one of the best bionicles there is ! probably the only thing that stands in his way is the exo body special bionicle	5
1	classic durable fun educational for kids of all ages including me	5
0	my 3 year old daughter and i have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand the design is nice it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice however after using it twice the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted this makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place it makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving my daughter was frustrated i eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child i do n't recommend this wand	5
1	my son likes this item the cars also fit his train set from imaginarium the only thing i did n't like about putting this together was the elevator very tight fit and does n't like to go up or down easily but everyone likes playing with it from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds	5
1	my son has really enjoyed this however after marks are made with the washable markers it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually	5
0	the horse does n't stay hooked on to the carriage too well it always comes apart it 's a pain it 's also tricky to get the horse to stay standing it 's cute to look at but my daughter lost interest in it quickly	5
0	our boys had a good time with this toy but after a 5 6 launches it broke ! not just the wings but the plastic body i feel like it was a waste of money and over priced	5
0	fisher price is selling the same item for only 33 139 99 has to be a mistake	5
0	we purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the disney princesses even though we purchased it as a play bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child we immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be it 's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably would n't last long anyway i recommend you look else where for your child 's princess dreams	5
1	this is fun not easy for 5 and under but great for the rest of us \( 7 65 \) gave us alot of laughs	5
1	my 3 year old son plays with them all the time they are a little challenging and he loves to see the completed puzzle the box is great and keeps the puzzles separate each puzzle peice is marked on the back for easy sorting i am ordering all of the boxed sets asap	5
1	this game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it his little sister who is two also loves this game this game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues it is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept there are no complex rules to learn so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game as each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the tv turned off	5
1	when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings she declared that she wanted a set for christmas she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son in law monopolize them with their little competitions these are wonderful for the imagination and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy	5
0	i am so glad we tested this product ahead of time as a rule we test all battery opperated gifts before we wrap them these walkie talkies worked for ab out 10 'feet' yes i said feet we gave them to my 2 year old grandson to play with instead of his big brother who got a set of midlands do n't waste your money on these	5
1	this is a great pack for a day trip to grandmas it only holds about 4 cassettes so if you have a lot of books you should go with the zipper case other than that my daughter loves it	5
1	i enjoy seeing my twin four year old son 's play with the read with me dvd program and cd 's the children are learning as they play i see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story this educational toy is very engaging the only problem i have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the dvd player it takes several tries to get the dvd player to respond to the remote	5

0	i have to agree with the other on here i got this for my 5yr for christmas and she seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now it sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it i was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead i tried and did n't think it was all that fun either i threw the box away and i'm sure i need that to return it if i could i would get her something else in return that she could use	5
1	this is a very handy product to have around for our 3 year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling the ac adapter is a life saver for long car trips just as an aside note the adapter does not look like the one in the picture it is gray and orange like the adapters you seen in the store	5
1	i bought this wireless weather station as a gift the recipient loves it for the price he is really enjoying it the only things he would change are interface to computer so that data could be tracked display of actual barometric pressure valuethese two features are available on more expensive models so i imagine in the future we will be upgrading	5

0	i was excited about this pool because it seemed really easy to store when not in use however the new type of valve does not hold in the air it says to push it all the way in but the valve on the one i bought would not stay in and when i tried to close the valve the presure from the air inside pushed open the valve and it deflated it would have been perfect had the valve worked properly	5
0	this was very dissapointing ! ! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade the mat looks like it comes from the dollar store or they ran out of color at the factory my daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one not like the box or commercial !	5

1	i had read about evacuators on a few forums it works as described no complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw 8 quarts that said perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve the fill drain capability looked appealing but if you do n't need to use this device to fill fluids i would opt for the drain only device less moving parts fewer things can fail	6
0	well i bought two of these i put it in my car in less then a week both of them ripped in the middle area i expected it to last a little longer \? \? i guess ill try sewing it back together or somethin	6

1	plugged the unit in a few weeks after i purchased it i was heading down to va for a reunuion \( 8 hr trip \) set it up facing backwards so the kids could make use of the cup holders from the middle seats of the minivan the unit cooled quickly and kept the sodas cheese and veggies cool throughout the unit is quiet did n't really know it was running unless i had the engine off could be a little roomier but you can only do so much with the space between the front seats overall got what i paid for and the unit worked as advertised	6
1	its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off i dont really buy any of those as seen on tv items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping remember this works best when over about 40mph and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea	6

0	very dissapointing the inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims	6
1	even if i could have only used this once for the 8 or so dollars it cost it would be worth it for how quickly and easily i was able to rid my apartment of dust sort of like a cheesy carnival game except i ended up with a dust free home just shake it off and it looks a tad grey from remaining dust but continues to pick it up amazingly well i bow before it 's greatness and just hope it lasts although if i need to buy a new one in a few months i 'll do it in an instant	6

1	owning 2 mercedes it is a pain to drain normally using the mityvac you insert the hose pump the vacuum and it draws out the oil my only problem has been a loose seal at the top of the lid the resulting leak requires additional pumping to create more vacuum still it is definitely easier than lifting the car and crawling underneath to drain it i also tried on my truck engine and differential and found it easy to use it was a real time saver on the differential since i did not have to break the gasket for the cover	6
1	well made tool can seem to be a bit heavy cleans well it was shipped lazer fast	6
1	an excellent tool works perfectly easy to use and was able to diagnose and facilitate correction of several nuisance trouble codes in a tundra	6
0	gimmick there are a number of rerouting oil change kits available why subject your engine to serious damage and loss of oil with the addition of rubber hoses and hose clamps that may crack or fail \? the oil filter seals itself very well on most engines while it can be a nuissance to remove on some vehicles i would n't risk hose failure for a little convenience on my toyota truck i discovered reaching through the engine from the hood is the fastest way to get to the filter i'm not sure that many people even change their own oil it 's cheaper to take it to the toyota dealer 29 95 and they even rotate the tires	6
1	it is really very nice and my colleague would like to buy that too they made my car looks very comfortable	6
0	we were expecting more of a cushion feel to this seat but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving it would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe but for a cushion its flat and cheap feeling as for king size it barely covers our car 's seat we ended up returning them not worth it	6
1	i bought this to use on a bmw motorcycle because it has awkward access to the pressure valve on the rims it works beautifully and the spoken measurement is very handy when you ca n't see the readout the readings are consistent with other gauges which i believe to be accurate so all in all this is a solid product and works as described	6

0	installed my bulldog 2030 ! it 's is a total piece of junk it only works when you tap on the hood you can pound on the back of the car and nothing put the sensor at max still nothing ! this is more of a novelty not an alarm its a freaking joke ! do n't waste your money	6
1	great product ! this tool is very intuitive and easy to use i find the greatest value is in having the mil codes internal to the device which makes finding the faulty component right at your fingertips i bought the obdii fault code book but quickly learned that i did n't need to have it	6

1	you have to be very careful how you apply this product the instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution only then will it work if you use too much you will experience the oil and water effect the other rater stated otherwise this product works very well remember to reapply when you see the effects going away	6
1	i got two of these for the front seats of my toyota suv they are very cute just like the picture but the backgrounds are a jungly green not black which i expected from the picture however the green goes great with my interior so i'm very pleased with these seat covers	6

1	i have a stainless steel table top and was very disappointed when trying to clean it with standard household cleaners most cleaners would only leave a dull finish and streaks i saw this product specifically for stainless steel and tried it the results are stunning a light spray and quick wipe with a cotton cloth leaves a dramatic bright and shiny surface no rubbing no scrubbing no fuss it 's worth it to have this one trick pony in your cleaning arsenal	6

0	i work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke with the money that you pay for a filter and 5 qts of oil you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up will this company stand by its product like that \? i doubt it for a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you 're worried about gunk it 's a scam	6

1	i wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models this gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use my favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve with other gauges you have to put in air then check the gauge put in air check it again with this gauge you can overinflate your tires a little bit then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired psi assuming this lasts a long time i would recommend it to everyone	6

0	if this gauge cost 20 i would give it a high rating but even at the discounted 35 price i see for these gauges i think it is bad value let alone the nearly 50 it cost me ! as mentioned hose is very inflexible at cool not just cold temps general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this mine is now leaking badly and i am trying to repair with quality materials as i still hope to use the gauge part anyway i would not buy again	6

1	all of my 2 hitch units work fine with this adapter i downsized from a suv with a 2 and went to a compact car with a 1 1 4 this allows me to use my bike carriers luggage racks etc	6
1	ordered mine directly from motive products for about the same price mine was missing the flexible tubing for brake bleeding and the handle was defective after emailing motive they promised to send a new handle and the missing tubing the unit worked as advertised a bit slow but be patient remember to warm up the engine a bit \( as directed in the instructions \) and unscrew the oil filler cap before drawing the oil out beats crawling under the vehicles and struggling with the oil pan nut ! will try bleeding brakes with it next time	6
1	the negative reviews of this thing most fall under that category of it took too long well that would be because you did n't let the oil warm up before trying to suck it through a thin piece of tubing idiot if you follow the directions this thing works great 5 stars i would buy it again in a heartbeat	6
1	hi alli am very happy with the unit and the service from amazon in sending it to me it has the features i wanted it to have and is very easy to use	6
1	this carrier is very good only one draw back the zipper only went around on two sides would be much easier to load if the zipper went around the third side as well so the top open like a flap	6
1	i kept getting tickets in the mail for going through ez pass tool booth out here in new york city my sticker was valid and i had money in my account they had no reason to keep sending me violation tickets in the mail each time i wrote them a letter explaining the circumstances and asked that they void the tickets they told the system had problems and they would fix it well i put a stop to it when i ordered 2 reflectors for my cars i have not had any tickets in the mail since i love this product it is so simple and yet effective everyone should get it the best 50 i have spent lately	6

1	wow ! i couldnt believe that they actually made a hitch for my sports car the car manual said that it is not possible to put a hitch on the rx8 but i really wanted one to accomodate my hitch bike rack i ordered this one and it fit perfectly in fact the holes in the hitch mounting bar lined up with holes already in the car frame like the car was designed to accept this hitch ! it only took me about one hour to install didnt even have to remove the tires or jack the car up ! very easy installation	6

1	although i have not tried other models of the california duster i really like this design since this model has dusting tassles all the way around you simple rotate the duster after each wipe this will ensure that the dust you capture does not build up in any one spot this design also works well for dusting the underside of my car 's spoiler the duster really does capture dust and not just push it around my only complaint is that the re usable storage bag should be larger than it is to make it easier to get the duster back into it	6
1	this is the best ! ! ! best store best service fast service and great packageing i will shop there again and recomend it to everyone !	6
1	i purchased it about a year and half ago it still does the job however i recently noticed that the duster does not work as well as in the beginning	6
0	this thing does not install in seconds as suggested it comes with goofy plastic pieces that you 're supposed to put in the window with it who want 's to fool with that everytime \? it also says to not use with tinted windows something that could have been mentioned here	6
0	advertised as easy to install just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it wrong if your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle they also do n't tell you it is not compatible with motorcycle relays if you get past all of this it does have a great sound	6
0	i'm very pleased with this laser garage park this laser garage park was easy to install and works really well i would recommend this to any one looking for a practicalway to avoid damage to their car while trying to park in thegarage	6
1	i found the product to be very useful myself wiring diagrams are better than any books i had seen and now i know why the information here comes from mitchell1 most of the pro technicians i know pay good money every month to use it the vehicle has a leak near the tailgate area and there were some honda tech bulletins here that i never knew about it was worth it just for that and details of the surprise third fuse panel under the hood true some of it might be over your head but overall i found eautorepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do it yourselfer	6
1	had scanner for just over a year and have used it on chrysler dodge and ford both obdi and obdii vehicles works great ! simple menu driven instructions and pick lists make using this scanner very easy to use	6
1	i have a 06 corvette and 05 explorer and i use the ramps for both vehicles oil changes they work well and seem safe and strong \( you should always use jack stands as an additional safety measure \) with the vette the ramps touch the front air dam but cause no damage \( if you are worried about it rubbing you could use two 1x4 's in front of the ramps for additional clearance \) the ramps are about 6 25 inches tall where the tire sits and there is plenty of room for me \( 250lbs \) under the vette nice product	6
1	i have n't had to use it too much thank goodness but just knowing that it is in my car gives me peace of mind i did have to charge a camera battery on it and it worked great love it	6
0	i own both the original unbreakable autolock \( with the flat key \) and the autolock pro \( with the round key \) the original autolock never failed to open after 10 years of use on two cars the autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use this is not a key problem because i could not open it with two original keys i eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it i recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device	6
1	i have a honda which i love but since i do not drive her on a daily basis now the battery is tempermental i bought this product and have had to use it several times i 've found it easy to use and even when the car battery has been completely dead this jumpstarter has had more than enough power to get her started i comparison shopped and the price of this black decker was the best bargain too recommend it highly	6
1	i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up when the company gave me a treo 650 so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing so i bought this skin from speck products its is absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches i'm a minimalist and for that the treo 650 skin is perfect ! a cool look not bulky easy access to the buttons they did their homework on this product a must have for anyone who owns a treo 650 i also see they have these for the blackberries	7
1	easy to snap on and it wont come off easy like others protects well and does not hinder any functions	7
0	save your money the eargels split in two days i used regular ear buds on the large size they did hold the buds in the ear better but no gain in sound quality if you want the small and med i 'll send them to you for shipping i have no use for them	7

0	i received 2 2 5mm to 3 5mm stereo headphone adapter one did n't work the other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality if you push the headphone jack \( male \) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker you have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers and even then the quality is not good	7
1	it is great ! you have to buy it believe me do n't waste your time looking for another case this is the best	7
1	i simply wanted a data cable to connect my verizon cell phone to my macintosh so i could transfer and synchronize data verizon was of no help and wanted to sell me a very expensive package that only worked on windows machines this thrifty cable \( lt 10 \) worked perfectly with the mac friendly datapilot software	7
0	chargers work great and are a great bargain however the generic lg driver software that comes with the usb cable to transfer music from computer to phone does n't have an authenticity signature i do n't know about other computers but mine with windows xp \( sp2 \) wo n't accept it	7
1	i love this phone cover it looks amazing i am concerned how long the rhinestones will stay attached	7
1	i would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from \? wich colors are there \? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee please answere asap	7
0	this stuff is n't even worth 14 99 my husband and my aunt could n't even hear me it 's a piece of crap i sent it back the same day don't buy it ! !	7
0	motorola one is far better in quality as well to use	7
1	i am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life i had to charge my old battery everyday i only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days	7
1	the treo600 has all the functions i needed phone calendar camera etc two shortcomings 1 \) the screen is not good for viewing pictures but that 's what i get for being unwilling to spend more for a treo6502 \) the phone failed to dial two times in two months i had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem	7
1	i ordered this headset in silver webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really is silver ! we argued about the color and i finally convinced them that samsung makes white silver red and black it took almost a month to get resolved but i finally have the silver headset that i ordered it is very small light and easy to use there are 3 different size earpieces for a better fit the headset gets 4 stars webtreo only gets 1 star i would n't order any products from them again	7
0	the darn thing broke almost immediately when i tried to switch gel covers \( it comes with 3 different sizes \) the entire earpiece came off in my hands ! what a flimsy piece of crap i just sent it back to amazon i'm never buying a jabra product again	7
1	i love this case because it allows me to combine both my wallet and my phone in one it is just nice to have to keep up with one less thing i highly recommend it if you like carrying less stuff	7
1	product was what was offered and came quickly no hassle great seller and amazing price	7
0	do n't waste your money after 18 months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life instead of updating to a newer phone accompanied by a new 2 year service agreement i opted to purchase a new battery waste of money ! the new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means i must re charge nightly that was the same predicament i encountered with the original battery nightly re charge	7
1	i agree it 's a waste to get sizes you do n't need here 's an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes	7
0	i returned this phone after one week currntly the motoral software has a glitch and you ca n't assign specifice ring tones to phone number ear piecs sound quality is marginal text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small the back panel display is too small and hard to read	7
1	this case was a perfect fit for my mot v180 phone the top and bottom pieces slip on the phone separately then snap together so they stay in place on the phone so it ca n't easily fall out \( a problem that i 'd had with a different product \) the part that slips over the top of the phone has a built in see through window that lines up just right so that the external display can be seen while the phone is in the case the quality of construction looks to be pretty good too	7
1	products exceeded my expectations the charger was n't very fancy but it seems to work fine and the price was very reasonable i was n't interested in the case but after i got it i found it to be very useful and the best part of the deal	7
0	it took a week and half to receive it 3 days to get confirmation for the order only and they ship by regular mail then there 's a single protective screen pre cut in a plastic it does n't cover well the whole screen surface \( it 's about 1 2 mm narrower \) and it 's very tough hard to put it in place without drawing dust or leaving fingerprints underneath i had to take it off immediately then once removed from place it 's a waste	7
0	snaps on easy but snaps off easy too it also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do this case also hinders comunications maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line	7
1	these work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound but they 're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping the only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying	7
0	yes the cable fits but the cd driver is just for the 8300 i was not able to get it working	7
0	the headset really has bad sound quality i missed the reviews before i ordered i should n't have bought it considering the quality of the headset i did n't even try the car charger in the fear that it would n't follow the necessary battery charge cycle	7
1	idropped my new phone at the bank without this case and the phone went everywhere in 3 places with this cover it is definatly protected i do n't like the smoke color but who really cares for the price	7
0	i encourage many to stay away from this usb product like previous reviewers said just spend the extra money on a better usb dongle as soon as i got this thing out of its package i almost snapped the casing off due to its poor construction the main problem that i have experienced with this product is that although its range is ok \( not the 100 meters that it claims \) as soon as i go into a room thats only 10 feet away has doors or walls in the way the reception starts to fluctuate in and out every 2 minutes	7
1	the holster that samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster how stupid is that \? why would samsung supply this type of holster to their customers \? however this holster has solved that problem you can now flip open your phone when using this holster thank yo	7
1	younger brother just got the verizon chocolate he 's been know to show it off and got his hold phones all scratched up its a good phone and he uses as an mp3 player but i digress the screen protect works as described it comes with a polish cloth and a plasting squeegee aplicator the film has some kind of electrostatic polymer there 's no adhesive but once you peel off both sides it seals right on to the screen squeegee help to get out 1 air bubble that formed i would recommend	7
1	i was expecting just to save the touch screen from scratches but these screens make the touch screen also feel better there was no loss of brightness with the screen placing the screen was a bit tough since clearning the surface perfectly is very tough its a pack of 15 screens have been using just the first one for the past three months and see no need to replace it at least for another three months if at all i 'll need to replace it	7
1	this product is great it fits like a glove and protects the phone while allowing you to view the screen unlike other cases	7
1	i have nothing but good things to say about this purchase and product it works and looks great i only wish they could make a pda phone that was n't as big as a boat	7
1	the headset works fine people who i talk to says they get better sound so wind prevention goes well but i doubt battery stand for 7 hours in talk time also it is not too easy to put it in your ear as other headset	7
0	the only support i received was to send me to a competitor 's homepage and try to download their software	7
1	when i lost my stylus i had a difficult time finding a replacement the others i tried were n't the same these are	7
0	these cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in asia with that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped the software being aftermarket too has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone despite what the descriptions say this software and cable are not compatable with mac at this time	7
1	not much to say about a battery i installed it it works fine	7
0	does not work with verizon v3c when i plug the phone in it says unauthorized charger and refuses to charge at all it is a useless piece of junk for me considering it is supposed to be a charger i give it one star only because amazon does not have the option for no stars if i could i would give it zero stars i suppose that would be bad for business but it is what it is avoid this cheaply made product and get the real thing maybe it works in china but not in north america	7
1	these replacement styluses fit perfectly into the phone and are an exact replacement for the original phone stylus	7
1	i recommend this phone to anybody i absolutely love it i have had it for three months now and not a problem so far the music player is great and i swear the camera looks alot better than 1 3 mega pixel the handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it if you buy this phone it will last you a long time but yeah so far no problems whatsoever i love it	7
1	i recently bought a nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones however the nokia ca 53 cable was around 50 dollars this was a great alternative so far everything that i have used it for is working flawlessly i would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the ca 53	7
1	works fine difficult to connect but connects securely comes with an unlabeled cd \( could n't tell one side from the other \) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones are n't labeled in any helpful way i was impressed it also has links to any 1st party software you need though i'm sure a google search would be just as easy	7
0	i bought this item to protect my new motorola l6 first of all it 's a cheap piece of plastic would break if dropped second and more important my phone doesn't work with it on ! the plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone preventing any usage of the entire phone beware don't buy	7
1	this is a nice cellphone i got it from a local cellphone shop free and only 1 year contract eventually prices will be free like the motorola razor v3 small phone and i like the mp3 player mode	7
1	when i first got this it did not look like it was big enough for my phone but as soon as i opened the package and put my phone in it i could tell it was a perfect fit i really like the clear window which i did not have on my previous case now i can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time	7
0	this worked for only a couple days although the belt pocket clip held my treo securely it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way after a cople of days the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time after a couple more days it was useless save your money on this one	7
1	i am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone i would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed	7
1	ive had this charger for the last couple of months and it fits in my phone perfectly and i have had no problems with it it is highly recommended to anyone with a nextel or boost phone	7
0	poor construction software that is difficult to install unable to run when installed and requires you to purchase a license to get a working copy buy something else that actually works	7
1	i think this is going to be a very good phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800 00 dollars well i called nokiausa direct and regular retail from them is 499 00all day as many as you want so it should be considerably less on amazon you would think \? i guess not !	7
1	i agree it 's a waste to get sizes you do n't need here 's an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes	7
1	be careful amazon identifies this phone as being gsm 850mhz it is not read the 'vital statistics' section in the full write up and you will see no mention of 850mhz check the sony web page \( and other people who sell this phone \) and you will see that it does not work on 850mhz i do n't own this phone but was researching it for a friend when i discovered this discrepancy i gave it 4 stars because of the cool magic mirror case i have no idea if this phone is really good or not	7
0	the adapter did not work when plugged in to a samsung m500 the sound only came out of one ear when plugged in	7
1	saves time and up downloading pics tunes to from my phone	7
0	i got the phone because it was small but i did n't know i 'd be sacrificing so much the speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day i get shoddy service and while i do like the design there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and i can see thru to the casing all in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but it 's not really the best for what you 'll want to do with your cell phone	7
0	i have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price i thought my fulfilled contract \( i am on month to month now \) meant i could qualify for a new account and keep my number no such luck after wasting a few hours dealing with cingular and then someone in india on behalf of wirefly i had to return it it is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75 lower than a loyal 13 year customer ! i will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though i would prefer the 750	7
1	these are very good and not expensive you buy these at staples and they charge 5 more i agree that a public exchange is needed if anyone knows of one can you please post that information here we 'll all appreciate it ! anybody want to trade the extras	7
1	i just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it it is my favorite phone i have had to date some people ask me what can that thing do \? and i respond to that what cant it do this phone can do anything you really want the features are nicely made to be used especially since it has a beautiful 2 2 in touchscreen the display is incredible i can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do the last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance	7
1	great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user strong and looks good it even comes with a clear plastic screen saver i am very happy with this product	7
0	i 've had two of these both sounded and worked well for a few months then the piece that goes over the ear and is described as too tight broke completely off of the first unit and snapped in two places on the second when this happens you 're perfectly operating earpiece becomes a bad piece of geek jewlery while it 's perfmance was good before the break the use of heap plastic under the rubberized piece instead of a small piece of memory titanum or something better renders this thing to the level of toxic waste \( battery contains lithium i bet \) skip by this one if you 're smart i 've been had twice	7
0	save your money the eargels split in two days i used regular ear buds on the large size they did hold the buds in the ear better but no gain in sound quality if you want the small and med i 'll send them to you for shipping i have no use for them	7
1	my only complaint and consequently the 4 star rating is that sometimes i do n't hear the blackberry or feel the vibration apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the oem plastic holster	7
1	the battery works great and lasts a long time i 'd give it 5 stars if not for the cheezy cover it falls off sometimes	7
0	net10 cell phones are great but do n't buy this card net10 is not set up to handle 3000 minutes cards i put the pin in my phone and did not receive the minutes i called technical support and received 1000 minutes i was on the phone for 3 hours before they told me that i will have to call in 30 days and then in 60 days to recieve 1000 more minutes each time because their system cannot issue more than 1000 minutes every 30 days don't buy this card	7
1	i purchased this headset \( \) and the key features i like are as follows 1 aaa battery no charging ! 2 easy to pair with my phone \( motorola slvr l7 european version \) 3 no static on both ends 4 have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated 5 price affordable but acts like an expensive headset 6 volume is good 7 fits well does not feel lose 8 22 hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced i am very happy with it i would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset	7
1	great case protects my sansa well even makes the buttons easier to push decent sansa products are hard to find thank you speck	7
1	got it a day later basically ordered around 10 pm and got it around today so great shipping and it works great drivers work and everything ! awesome deal for 3 bucks	7
1	excellent price for the charger original motorola equipment shipping was a little steep for such and inexpensive item shipping was very fast i definetly will continue to do business with amazon and a1 accessories very pleasant and uneventful shopping experience	7
1	i bought one of these extended batteries on e bay and was really sorry it did n't hold a charge i was reluctant to try again but i was glad i did this time i got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery	7
0	the service was good but the product did n't have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i could n't use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice	7
0	i have n't tried the hands free device and probably wo n't bother but the case is cheap looking and the charger did n't work at all as they say you get what you pay for ! i'm going to an actual store and get a real motorola accessory kit do n't bother with this one	7
1	my perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine i use the headset all day without any discomfort i higly recommend it over the other types of headset	7
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
1	this battery arrived fast fits and works well i highly recommend this seller	7
1	i'm very happy with this case i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo 700p but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it in other words i did n't want something that was attached to the treo permanently this did the trick it 's simple but looks good seems to be solidly made as well	7
1	but it does have some faults i have had it for some time now i got it for my 11th birthday i have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon faults very short battery life i have to charge it almost every day ! camera the picture you take ca n't move or it comes out all messed up good parts big screen easy to read ! recording videos even though you get 15 seconds i still use that to make funny videos with my friends it 's style i love the color and style ! my friends are all jealous overall i think it 's a great phone	7
1	this is the prettiest one i think ! there are other pinks but they are tacky this mauve is the perfect pink for my taste do n't ever discontinue this item these are great	7
1	iam very pleased with this item i purchased it for my son	7
1	the whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with cingular wireless customer service to port over my number from verizon the treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes i 've owned it for three weeks now and i am still discovering great phone pda features i bought a 4gb mini sd card \( samsung memory \) from ebay for 39 99 combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs i also bought a shure tec3 earbuds for 110 they 're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2 5mm jack	7
1	besides all the functions described above the cable has one more function it can be used as a charger too ! this is really cool the company 's service is great for every order i put i received the products within 3 4 days at the price of ground shipping fees	7
1	the cover design is well made based on the requirements the problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the lcd screen because of the openings on both the sides in my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the blackberry out of the case	7
1	this is a wonderful cover for your blackberry very sturdy and easy to use love it !	7
1	i have tried a dozen screen guards some of them shine a lot some of them are not as clear as they promise some take like 2 hrs to stick on the screen without any air bubble this makes its way through all that problems well on the other hand it does have a catch1 finger print magnet2 the price that price for one ! ! ! and yea the best part is its static not gum and its washable	7
1	some of the reviews said that both chargers worked fine but they were unable to get the data cable to work however i found no such problems and successfully used the data cable to transfer files off of my phone after installing the drivers just search the web for a program called bitpim it 's not exactly the nicest looking software but gets the job done	7
1	i 've owned and discarded numerous chargers this one is great the retractable wire is very convenient for storage and use it looks pretty fragile but so far it 's held up to pretty heavy use many of the other chargers i 've owned have also had problems keeping a consistent connection no such problems with this one	7
1	i agree with previous reviewers \( gely zencity \) regarding this cable the price was right set up was easy and \( with the bitpim program \) you can communicate with your lg vx8300 efficiently i loaded my whole outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones do n't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from verizon 's sites \( vcast and such \) just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music tones that you already own	7
0	i owned two of these earbooms the fit was comfortable and the sound very good however after a month or two of use both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece i imagine this came from adjusting the boom position which put strain on the plastic the plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress	7
1	got this to protect my motorola l6 phone it fits the phone like a glove i also love that it protects the phone screen the only complaint is that the case open easily if it 's dropped or handled in a rough way clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that my toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it the case still does not have a chip or crack on it	7
1	i just picked up one of these for my motorola cell phone it has more than enough volume it comes with both a right and left ear adapter fits pretty good and i have medium sized ears its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it it is very comfortable though if you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset	7
1	only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil	7
0	we 've had 3 of the lg1500 in our family plan for nearly a year very inconsistent service when calling our son i would get a message that his number was blacklisted after calling cingular several times we demanded new phones not lg1500 we were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing so we 're getting a different brand if a phone does n't work the company needs to get rid of them !	7
1	i highly recommend this bundle for the price for less than the cost of an offical verizon travel charger you get a travel charger home charger and a usb cable with driver cd everything works just fine the instructions for the usb cable are very lacking so here are my suggestions you can use windows media player to move music over to your phone using the sync feature and you can use a free program such as bitpim to do other file transfers between your pc and phone	7
1	while i thankfully have n't had to test the protective qualities of this product it appears it will do the job nicely the only thing i would change is to give it a fixed belt clip	7
1	as usual motorola provides simple to use reliable equipment but this is not all it 's more than free you get 50 bucks out of this deal	7
0	this thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you do n't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo	7
1	i just got the cable and the software for my motorall v600 and it 's very easy to use i just did a backup of all my contacts pics and music	7
1	i needed a razr car charger and the crystal clear hard shell case was included with the purchase i did not think i would even use it but i love it ! it is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my razr phone !	7
0	a useless piece of junk worked for 3 minutes then broke have since bought a motorola brand one for three times what i paid for this piece of junk do not be attracted by a cheap price tag because you get what you pay for \( or what you dont pay for in this case \)	7
1	great product exactly as advertised thinking about buying a couple more in different color	7
1	excellent sound quality noise cancellation really works the button on the headset string lets you automatically place a call and end the call very nice works much better and more reliably than any bluetooth set i 've tried and i 've tried almost all of them	7
1	i have a baby pink razr and this skin looks so good over it also it really adds grip so it 's not as easy to drop and the silicone stays warm in cold weather unlike the bare metal of the razr i would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr they are awesome	7
1	i really like the javoskin for my treo it 's well made and has openings so all the features of the treo are usable the material is soft to the touch but strong on protection i do n't like the lanyard they send with the product it 's about 24 long and reminds me of shoelaces i prefer a smaller more delicate lanyard that would go around my wrist	7
1	i switched to this phone from verizon e815 some of the details i find different pros sleek designgood battery lifecompact2mp cameracons choppy voice sometimes hard to listenscreen and buttons little smallworks for me as i do n't use the phone for internet email or use lot other features	7
1	the battery was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly will do business again the battery make 's the phone last 2 days even with continued use	7
1	i'm a previous owner of body glove cel phone cases \( a moto v810 \) i purchased this item from amazon a few days ago for my 6255 my cel fits perfectly the case protects every part of my cel \( buttons screens jacks \) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice my next phone will have its body glove case too	7
0	for a good price of approximate 4 50 \( as i recall \) plus shipping i ordered the bargaincell brand new ikross retractable car cigarette lighter adapter it did not work i suppose i could have packaged it up and sent it back \( at a cost to me \) and probably received a replacement but for the cost of the unit it was not worth my time i 've resorted to using a standard car recharger	7
0	the other reviewer could n't run much power through his splitter but thought it might be ok for cell phone chargers etc i wanted a splitter for my radar detector and my cell phone charger so i thought great i ca n't get any power through mine at all the little light goes on but the radar detector does n't go and the cell phone charger does n't go i 'll probably take it apart andd see if i can rewire it it is n't worth shipping back i really ca n't recommend buying one of these things from this manufacturer	7
1	i was concerned with the 1 star review so i ordered from desirepro \( who had a higher rating \) instead of eforcity i received my order promptly and it works well	7
1	though still not quite enough battery for the juice sucking q it is worlds better than the included battery i would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies	7
0	i ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival also notice that this is not a samsung oem part if you call to ask for tech support from samsung they will tell you they ca n't help you the only positive thing i have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless	7
1	not looking to spend the cash for bluetooth but need something to work \? this is it with the extra button you can answer put a call on hold or hang up without fumbling for your phone very happy with the purchase	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	my tracfone has good reception i like that it has free call waiting and free caller id if you have n't activated your tracfone yet then the 'refer a friend program' will give each of us 100 free minutes please send me an email and i will send you a fast referral it 's a win win ! thank you	7
1	the battery was everything needed no surprises it fit the phone and charged fine	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this charger works perfectly with my samsung blackjack it is very affordable and much less expensive than buying with the phone	7
0	i guess you get what you pay for so i was n't totally surprised that the battery did n't work what was worse is that when i sent it back to get a new one they instead just refunded me a part of what i paid for it do n't do business with these guys and do n't buy this battery	7
0	the service was good but the product did n't have enough info for me to make a wise decision at the end i could n't use the product on my jabra ear piece the item description should have information on compatible ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice	7
0	i saw the other review that said it did n't work for v173 but i bought this anyway for my v170 it also does n't work for v170 why amazon is advertising and selling this product as a motorola v170 charger is beyond me i guess sometimes the products are mislabeled	7
1	this is my first blackberry phone and i must say it 's an awesome device ! my husband has a blackberry through his work so i got one too how we can pin each other keep in touch via email etc while he is away the pearl has wonderful reception great style great features etc i highly recommend it	7
1	i like this case very much for my blackberry it definitely improves the grip on the blackberry especially when i'm using it as a phone it also serves as an excellent protector when i throw it in my purse my two problems are that i wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the speck ipod protective cases \( come on guys ! women use these items too ! \) also the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the blackberry in the week that i 've had this case other than those two things this is a great not bulky case	7
1	you might have to pay a little bit more but the reliability offered by oem products gives one much peace of mind i am always willing to wait a little longer and pay a little more if i know what i am getting is not just a counterfeit i think i got my money 's worth	7
0	i have had to exchange my pink verizon motorola razr 3 times ! ! ! ! ! ! luckily i purchased the insurance i'm going back tomorrow for my 4th phone in 1 yr \( this last phone only lasted a few weeks ! \) this time i am asking for different phone the phone works fine then all of sudden one day 1 2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the is on the screen and you ca n't get to anything no phone numbers no voicemail no text messages nothing ! ! ! ! it is extremely frustrating what is the point of a cute phone that does n't work	7
0	advantages 1 \) superior protection i have dropped my phone twice onto concrete and there has been no damage to phone or case 2 \) all buttons accessible though a bit difficult to get to in cases disadvantages 1 \) signal quality is worse when the phone is in the case ! 2 \) belt clip useless since the case can easily open spilling out the phone when on one 's belt 3 \) side ok button difficult to press same with top two front front buttons \( above start and ok buttons \) summary usable only for protection during transportation and does this well phone should be removed from case during usage	7
1	driver install was easy and bitpim access works just fine the cable i received also charges the phone \( vx8300 from verizon \)	7
1	how come phone accessories do n't qualify for prime shipping \? how are they different from other electronics	7
0	i have had this phone for about six months i replaced a kyocera that i disliked because it was so big but the size of this phone does not begin to make up for its problems the menus are very poorly designed they are difficult to navigate and it 's hard to do anything the ringer speaker is inside the phone so when it 's closed it 's almost impossible to hear i almost never hear it ring i usually keep it in my pocket with the vibrate turned on but if you turn the phone off the vibrate gets turned off so you have to remember to turn that back on ! i hate this phone and will be replacing it soon	7
1	holds the phone in an attractive snug leather case ! clips to belt and holds tight since the phone is horizontal and not vertical i do n't have trouble catching it on things i 've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car the phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap this case works great and eliminates that problem ! the perfect solution	7
1	was received in a timely manner however the picture online was not what i expected for the price i really thought it was a little cheap looking in person as it was a gift i was somewhat disappointed in the quality however the person i gave it to was pleased	7
0	well im 16 writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it first off it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen and that takes forever the phone in general is slow also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece im stuck with this phone for a while and am not to happy with it	7
0	i bought this product to download pictures from my cell phone onto the computer the description stated that it would work for my selected model phone however it does not ! ! the software needed to download the pictures is not correct when we called the customer services they were of no help they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem apparently i am not the only person to have this problem with the product again the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are not accurate it does not work	7
1	the pack is quite as described any one of the three itemsmight justify the small expense	7
0	i ordered this phone on 3 28 07 it shipped via fedex on 3 29 07 to my office with an indicated delivery of 3 2 07 the package sat on the fedex truck for three days before they attempted to deliver it at 8pm to an adjacent business and then left it without the package being signed for this was after i 'd already called fedex to refuse delivery of the package because it was too late in arriving fedex 's response for it sitting three days on the delivery truck was that the driver was overloaded for the 100 difference in price it was less hassle to just go to the local cingular store	7
1	this item came with the other item i ordered at the same time it 's quality is good but does not stay on the phone when opened as well as i would have liked	7
1	i loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands ! ! anyone who are crazy over that color !	7
0	this product had a strong rubber petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	7
0	the darn thing broke almost immediately when i tried to switch gel covers \( it comes with 3 different sizes \) the entire earpiece came off in my hands ! what a flimsy piece of crap i just sent it back to amazon i'm never buying a jabra product again	7
1	i am very happy with the phone case there are alot of cases available this is by far the best in my opinion	7
1	this is a great basic cell phone i bought one and received another as a gift unfortunately i opened both so now i have \( 2 \) if anyone needs one for twenty five plus shipping that has not been registered with net10 \( still has bonus 300 minutes and no number \) is new and has all original accessories \( open package \) or for ten extra you can get an oem car charger leather case and earphone \( all unused \) please email movieshop \( at \) hotmail \( dot \) com	7
1	car charger serves it purpose it charges the cell phone in a car or any cigarette lighter the design is basic with no hidden features you just need to make sure you plug the connector in the right way i would have liked some type of label that would have identifed it as a motorola compatible device otherwise a perfect gift !	7
0	i bought these adaptors to use regular head phones \( 3mm \) with my cell phone mp 3 \( lg cu500 \) player once you plug the 3mm headset into this adaptor you loose stereo sound you only can hear the music through one ear whoever started the whole 2 5mm adaptor in cell phones should be put in jail it makes it impossible to use a regular headset to listen to music on your cell phone i have tried 3 stereo cell phone headsets and they all have poor sound quality especially the base level they all have some type of flaw the volume wo n't get loud enough cord to short poor sound etc	7
1	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
0	you will still need to buy the ac cord for this unit this is not a charger it 's essentially a 30 00 piece of plastic that holds the q upright	7
0	although this product is very nice i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect to me the words charge all at once means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall however this is not the case this item is simply a method for organizing you devices although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34 99 i paid and if it was n't a gift and christmas was n't 3 5 days away i would return it i feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer	7
0	bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return replacement deadline should n't a cell phone battery last longer than a month \? \? they refuse to refund or replace they are a shady company and i 'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same	7
1	i have a motorola v220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month the cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet it 's fairly light weight and made of plastic but seems durable enough a small red led lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet regardless of whether you 're charging your phone or not i debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price	7
1	i 've had it for about 2 months and i am still happy with it it has a little blue led light that comes on when the car is on which is pretty bright and could get annoying to some people but i like it	7
1	sony ericsson w710i is a very nice cell phone 850 900 1800 1900 gsm pedometer bluetooth gprs ir 2mpix camera mp3 player \( 512 mb included \) and so on this baby is loaded	7
1	i purchased the pink razr with cingular service and could n't be happier i have had it for about a month and have had no problems at all i am very happy with it t mobile is not a very good service in my opinion and that is why i chose cingular	7
0	this case actually scratches and destroys your pearl the inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone the phone does n't provide any protection on top i really regret buying this my phone is all scratched get a soft case that stays on permanently pass this one up	7
1	i love this phone i can do so much with it it is light weight and fun to carry i love the button flip feature great phone ! !	7
0	this deal was too good to be true of course i was n't expecting any name brand stuff here but at least i expected them to all work i do n't know if i got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used the case i did n't need but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed the power adapter seems to work fine so basically i spent 9 99 and am only using the power adapter i guess that 's a good enough deal i think i 'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud headset though	7
1	this is the best phone i have ever had reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera and best of all very very user friendly	7
1	i had been using this product for 2 weeks now no problems discomfort quality stuff	7
1	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	functions the same as more expensive chargers sold in cellphone stores excellent product for the price i bought two one for home and one for work	7
0	i was extremly disappointed when i received this it did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can i had one of the first razor phones and it did not fit when i got th belt clip i went to cingular to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip that did n't fit either i would no recommend this product to anyone even if it does cost a dollar with shipping cost it costs about 6 00	7
1	this product needs a better custom fit it slides around too much it needs a smaller fit it is too big	7
1	i will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone i have ever owned its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear	7
1	this is a very nice case it fits well and even though it is made of plastic it has a textured leather feel to it i found that i had to file the charging plug as the case impeads the plug from a flush fit a great case that i would highly recommend	7
0	first time when i plugged in the cell phone displayed error message that charging error remove immediately since then i am not using this	7
1	the title says it all fits great great price ! real leather and fits like a glove	7
0	the gel inserts on the jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me it 's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end i'm not happy with these	7
1	i will only use krusell products as they are better than best customer service is as good as the product there is no finer quality and the selection of products is well above the rest krusell products cost a little more but quality and durability far surpass the price the rating should be a 10	7
1	if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing ! ! ! do n't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that \? \? ! ! ! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it ! ! ! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn t have a chord jeez !	7
0	i love the way the phone looks and feels but that 's about it from finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone i 've ever owned i 've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise	7
0	this device is unusable with a treo 600 every time you try to put the phone in or take it out it pops out the memory card do n't waste your money	7
1	after about a year the ear support on this bluetooth headset broke bad news good news it has a 2 year warranty and logitech is replacing it with a mobile traveller model since the mobile freedom is no longer made contact logitech tech support audio by phone \( ca n't be done over the web \) it 's nice to see a company stand behind their products way to go logitech	7
1	this case is pretty good snaps on in a sec and it is not too bulky come with belt clip if u need i	7
0	this product stopped working after about a week or two lesson learned buy oem products instead of cheap knock off	7
0	i dropped my treo enough times to break it and every fall was directly the fault of this garbage case	7
1	as advertised on time i 've used for two months and it works great i 'd buy from this outfit again	7
0	i purchased this to replace a lost holster the first time i tried to place the 7290 in the case it split at the seams	7
1	this phone is great ! ! ! i love this phone i have had no problems with this phone at all the camera is pretty good and it 's small and cute in size and it has good reception i would definitely reccomend this phone ! !	7
0	i didnt got the car charger i actually bought they sent a regular one im not even using it wrong item	7
1	my perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine i use the headset all day without any discomfort i higly recommend it over the other types of headset	7
0	it looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily the shipping was fast and the price was right	7
1	i just got this charger yesterday and it feels really nice it feels solid and professionally made not some cheap import special i like the blue led light instead of the typical red dot also the cord is long enough to talk and charge at the same time and at the same time the coil keeps it out of the way when you have the phone down just charging the ic chip is important so that you do n't overcharge your phone battery and shorten it 's life i would buy again great price for a quality charger	7
1	very nice but i do n't like the belt clip if i remove the belt clip there is still an impediment where it use to be	7
1	it 's just as advertised the cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cord that 's just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for charging syncing the 8125 use it every day	7
1	it fits great but does n't cover the corners of the phone kinda the point of a case the seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful the bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you 're stuck with it sticking out in your pocket	7
1	this item cost 1 penny \( of course the shipping was 4 84 \) but i thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores i 've had it for two weeks and it has n't broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally ca n't go wrong with the price order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters	7
0	when i started charging my k750i it didnt charge at all no matter what this is a load of s dont buy i	7
1	this is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen i do n't foresee it peeling ever it has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on i 've washed mine it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place it is extremely sensitive to bending and if you bend it it will never go back so be extra careful	7
1	use it every day it 's a nice connector that does just what it says it does as with all treo palm connectors you need to make sure the contacts are clean to get a good connection wiggling the connector where it meets the treo is usually enough for it to work for me	7
0	the phone may be fine but i will never know because my virgin mobile service never really worked perhaps it was the phones fault i never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account overall their customer service is awful days of waiting and receiving no information i had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right i spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed now i have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service i plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone its garbage i went with the t mobile sidekick and already am way happier	7
1	these are very good and not expensive you buy these at staples and they charge 5 more i agree that a public exchange is needed if anyone knows of one can you please post that information here we 'll all appreciate it ! anybody want to trade the extras	7
0	function followed form on this one ! ! you ca n't see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light so you ca n't see who 's calling or what time it is without opening the phone it hurts your ear when talking the buttons are difficult to push it 's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers too many prompts to reply to a text thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool' i returned it and got my money back	7
1	i love these eargels my ears are a funny shape and i ca n't wear regular earbuds but when i add these gels they fit great and do n't fall out they block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound isolating earbuds sometimes i need a small and sometimes i need a medium depending on the day the weather and how long i use them \( i gave the large size to my boss and he loves them too so do n't say you ca n't use all of the sizes guys	7
0	service is terrible no good ringtones my missed calls list is always mixed up on the dates dont get it ! you will end up paying the same if you have a plan	7
0	i agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months now not only does it not charge my phone but if i plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge ! it 's also always falling out of the lighter plug i do n't have that problem with any of my other chargers and i carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets	7
1	i am very surprised how well this case fit my razr v3m it fits very well and looks very nice	7
0	i bought 2 charges to try and save a buck but they are complete junk they worked but never well for about a month and then the metal charger tip totally pulled apart from the unit	7
0	este producto no es lo que anuncian 100 metros de alcance y solo palabras no sirve no la debuelvo porque me sale mas caro el envio de lo que cuesta esta porqueri	7
1	i have always been pretty picky about my poptarts so i was n't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when i first got them they are great poptarts my kids love them	8
0	this stuff tastes great but after doing some research it 's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy the first item on the list \( which means that it is the highest mass ingredient \) is partially hydrogenated oils if you have any problems with cholesterol i suggest talking to your doctor or maybe you might want to be like many americans and just increase your lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers godspeed	8
1	none of that super sugared candied dried fruit or flat tasting candy e g chocolate chips to mess up a yummy but healthy snack do n't get me wrong i love chocolate the darker the better but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing if i want candy i 'll buy the good stuff thanks amazon my local market no longer carries it	8
1	the price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what i ordered great deal and great service	8
0	i was trying these as a change of pace from the turkey jerky i normally eat they taste ok \( nothing special \) but several of the medallions \( in at least 3 bags so far \) had 'crunchy' bits in them i suspect it was gristle or possibly small bone fragments not pleasant to eat i may have just gotten a bad batch \( other than the crunchy bits i 'd give these a 4 star rating \)	8
1	i 've been using agave in my tea coffee cooking and on pancakes for over a year i'm a type 2 diabetic and need something with a low glycemic index this product is the best and it tastes wonderful my kids do n't miss honey on their pancakes any more and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes highly recommend	8
1	other than the republic of tea the people 's green tea i really like yogi tea healing formula not only is it 80 organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract \( protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation \) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one 's daily life other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life the only side effect is insomnia and i'm suffering from it but i know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day !	8
1	nutritious soft delicious organic zero trans fats whole grain hempfor fiber omega 3 's and some protein we just love em ! !	8
1	i bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth i buy natural snacks for my kids \( freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar \) but i find them bland so i ordered these and i love this flavor in fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it was n't too spicy for her they use black pepper which is flavorful but i would n't call it spicy	8

0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
1	it 's a great new \( at least for me \) crystal light flavor my husband loves it	8

1	i 've been over here in japan for the past 3 years and have n't made too many visits to the states i will be returning next week though however this stuff is definitely one addictive snack in japan it 's marketed by the same company as saya endou not a strong flavor just something to munch on not too salty and not too sweet kampeki \( perfect \) a purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism	8
1	this is a great tasting coffee i highly recommend it as it is shade grown and fair trade certified	8
1	this product is the best no aftertaste it 's organic and has a low glycemic value i use it in beverages it 's lighter than honey in this bottle it squirts out easily i seem to require a less amount than honey or raw sugar to gain the same sweetness this is for the light easy storage and does not change consistency over time the regular might be heavier and could require even less for same sweetness	8
0	pro no trans fat con no flavor basically tastes like cardboard my children wo n't eat it	8
1	timothys coffee is my favorite ! and the 2 packs boxes is a very good value	8
1	i have used this cake mix many many times the first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday she said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a snap with my large stand mixer i have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though i am the only gluten free person i add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream yummy	8

1	this is unlike any other bar i 've tried i like that it 's gooey green i'm tired of the drier oat like bars it 's satisfying tasty may not be for everyone though i only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat ok for a meal on the run	8

0	terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top the flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and i wondered what i was eating ! alone they were nearly tasteless and i 'll never purchase again yuck	8
1	these are a perfect size for work and great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
1	very good not a rich dessert by any means but a healthy filling snack my kids really like them and while they are n't low calorie or really low fat it is n't full of sugar and it contains healthy fat the 5 grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full	8

0	i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but do n't like all the garbage that goes into them we tried newman o 's originals my wife went first and the look on her face said it all still i had to see for myself we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies for some reason others seem to think they taste great just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large	8

1	this is mine and my husbands favorite tea it has such a smooth satisfying taste we have tried about all the earl grey teas and this is the best we ca n't always find it so when i found it on amazon i was elated being able to buy it in the 50 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) was just what we were looking for and we will continue to buy it here thanks amazon	8

1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8

1	this is my favorite of essn 's juices it is unique and has a beautiful color which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails also a huge hit with kids ca n't beat 100 juice worth every penny	8
0	first of all the tea chest is disappointing to say the least the chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like 'finish' which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic the tea its self is alright sadly nothing special this item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after i opened it a few dozen times needles to say this product way disappointing all around	8

1	this tastes and looks like the real thing \( wheat semolina \) my kids ca n't tell the difference i'm not wasting my time sampling all of the others now	8
1	i take these to work along with little minature milks i pick up at the convenient store they 're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine and they 're not too bad for you either considering they 're all the sugary cereals your mom complained about when you were a kid in fact the one with the highest calorie count \( 280 \) is the rasin bran and that 's something that would actually be considered healthy all the rest fall into the 160 220 range	8
1	i love this cereal i like the slightly sweet wheaty taste and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time i also snack on it dry it stays with me for a long time keeping me from eating junk	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	these are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket and they are worth even the higher price do n't worry about buying too many with the six pack i was a little concerned about that when i bought here a few months ago but my wife and i ate all of them easily i'm not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves but in these euro style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor	8
1	i tried a two lb pack and then ordered this for a reorder tart cherries great for oatmeal and sauses as well as snack	8
1	this is a terrific espresso i got hooked on lavazza in italy and have n't found any other espresso blends to knock it off it 's throne this is my first time purchasing lavazza whole beans and i think i 'll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor would highly recommend !	8
1	this is a deliciously smooth tasting coffee rich flavor and no acid stomach ! i 've had a hard time getting it locally and amazon has saved me	8

1	excellent one of the few food items i 've found on here that i think i 'll buy again remember that it 's best chilled ice cold if you 're ever gonna sample it not so good when not so cold great when actually cold very refreshing feel either way though after you 've had a drink	8
1	i am a true fan of all things ginger and this tea is wonderful very warming and spicy	8
0	i had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee at first i thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee i use worked fine sometimes it took 3 4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee most of the time i would just give up again the other brand of coffee i use never does this not getting this coffee anymore i would comment on the taste but i never got to really taste it with the grounds and all donna marylan	8
1	first i 'd like to say that many of nana 's cookies are most delicious and i 've tried most of the flavors my favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip as one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie for those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions vegan sugar substitutes etc these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we 've been led to believe we want thanks nana 's for the natural foodie options	8
1	this product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep before this i was taking harsh medicines like tylenol pm 's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before i went to bed ! not with the tea ! let me clarify it will not knock you out but just help to relax you	8
0	this biscotti is just awful too sweet and too hard la tempesta is a real biscotti	8
1	the only way i drink this stuff is mixed with a cup of coffee makes a very nice late afternoon treat without a ton calories !	8
1	illy rules my favorite espresso roast great price excellent	8
1	we really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of august 2006 and the expiration date on the product of november 10 2006 feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not otherwise they are great crackers	8
1	i brought a few bags to a work day in may and people are still asking me about them because you ca n't buy them in stores around here they 're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips but people eat them by the handful like potato chips but instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips the soy protein gives you energy	8
0	these are not the greatest thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come not so they were not what i had expected	8
1	what can i say about lavazza that has n't already been said i was in rome two summer 's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets decaf is usually not so great but this is they must be doing something right	8
0	i have tried all there fruit products and absolutely love them all however this sweet corn is all but sweet i would say it should be called salty corn i think they would have a great product if they did away with the salt also or change the name to salty corn cause if this was the first product someone tried from this company i dont think they would give the other products a try from there line myfavorite is cherry berry and orchard blend	8
1	while i like all of the kashi products i 've tried this one has to be my favorite ! with a little fresh fruit how much more healthy can you get \? great taste with seven grains and sesame ! perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box	8
1	he did not know if he would but he loves them great for a quick snack or a snack to go please do n't quit selling these glad we bought them and will buy more	8
0	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	i was a bit disappointed in these they crumble very easily and have an unusual texture my son \( 6 \) does not like them	8
1	i really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands	8
0	wish i would have paid attention to this one the the previous review the cost for what you get is outrageous only reason i gave it one star is because there was no place to give is zero starts do n't waste your money like i did ! ! ! find a more economical product \( plenty more choices on amazon btw \)	8
1	the product is pretty good but is only 10 calories less that the optimum power which has blueberries in it it is a healthy and fairly satisfying cereal but not my favorite	8
1	these are fresh and have just the right amount of licorice flavor they are much softer than most black licorice and are easy to chew this is the best licorice i have ever had bar none ! the bag is huge ! haribo really knows how to make candy	8
1	my family prefers the blue agave to the lighter colored and sweeter agaves we use it to make raw truffles \( sooo good \) and on top of pancakes and waffles cereal rice pudding etc we had no problems with shipments leaking so far	8
1	this is a very tasty creamy hot cereal if you 're gluten sensitive give this a try after i switched to a gluten free diet i was missing oatmeal something awful i thought i would give this a try as an alternative and was glad i did ! with some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination you can be satisfied with this cereal	8
1	i 've purchased many of these products i put this in my top three good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick	8
1	someone told me to look on amazon to locate this product it 's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees' the taste is out of this world and so easy to make i inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner thank you for having this product on amazon	8
1	we bought these because there was an online coupon for them my children \( ages 11 and 14 \) take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices the price was right and with the free shipping when going over 25 it was hard to resist the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor they are a nice change and we 're really enjoying them	8
1	fox river rice pudding is incredibly fragrant almost overwhelming when you open the package the finished product is mellow and delicious not too rich i'm going to try it in the crock pot one of these days glad i tried it	8
1	i find this coffee to be very rich in flavor yest strong enough for my taste	8
1	i love these cookies ! the only complaint i had is that i ordered a case \( 12 boxes \) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day i received the shipment yikes i still have over half the case left and i 've been eating them daily \( and giving them away \) ! i probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone however if you 're looking for a great organic cookie without trans fats this is a nice healthy option	8
1	i have to say that this 100 count box is a great deal for your money although this is n't a full size slim jim but rather a shorter one it 's the perfect size for a lunch box surprise or a mid afternoon pick me up slim jim has managed after all these years to still provide the same taste of slightly spicy slightly salty goodness and you wo n't go wrong with the 100 count box	8
1	these are the best banana chips i 've ever had and the dried cherries are a great combination ! i would highly recommend this product	8
1	great product what else can i say \? while i lived in the caribbean i ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there	8
1	these are very good biscotti ! i've ordered 4 boxes of 12 in the past few months they were nice to give as gifts they were good to bring to someones house for dessert the chocolate decadence and the ones with the toffee bits and almonds are very good the only negative is the shipping and handling cost if i did not get the free shipping and handling i would not have ordered them they're good but not good enough to spend an extra 20 to deliver	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
0	i ordered this mocha java because the green mountain brand was not available there is no comparison i am very disappointed in the flavor of this coffe	8
0	granola was very dry and not too sweet need milk i prefer costco 's granola it taste much better i would not recommend the purchase of this product now i got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages also bought the fruit and nut one hope that 's better	8
1	this is the best crumb topping i have ever made i got rave reviews for my christmas pies and it was so easy cause it was already made for you just add a few things and done what a pleasure	8
0	maybe i'm daft but i ca n't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine i 've tried tamping them which does n't work well and i 've tried just placing them in the filter in both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso as with other european products \( think ikea \) there are no printed instructions in english just line art drawings perhaps i'm just doing something wrong i like the concept of pods but i 'll stick to beans instead	8
1	i use k cups all the time at work at home etc there are a handful of good k cup brands out there this is one of the best both decaf and regular timothy 's columbian are smooth and rich in flavor add some creamer and sweetener and goodbye to any other coffee ! ! you wo n't be disappointed believe it or not the home brewing k cup machine \( keurig \) gives a better cup of coffee versus the commercial k cup machine \( also keurig \) because the hot water does not blast too quickly through it fyi	8
1	this mix is a blessing for those w food allergies ! even if we did n't have any food allergies i 'd buy this mix i do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer \( 10m \) if using a glass dish	8
1	i'm french and i love these galettes they are the typical kind of cookies you can find in brittany \( bretagne \) with a light salted butter taste i like the tin too you can keep it to store whatever you like ! make a great gift to french cookies lovers	8
0	i thought they had a stale texture and they did n't have enough salt ener g does make a type of sesame pretzel that is incredible but these are n't it hope this helps all the gluten free people like me	8
0	donot buy it i got the stuff even past the expiration day	8
0	these pods perform poorly in my espresso machine while ground beans perform very well it could be the filter for the pods but the espresso comes out uneven from the spouts and the flavor is not very strong	8
1	it just is ! not much else to say about this	8
1	outstanding full flavored earl grey tea better than the other non branded earl grey teas	8
1	just what it says all white meat individually sized portable and easy to prepare perfect alternative for tuna sala	8
1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
0	this mix was very sour and because of the way the fruits are dried there were a lot of crumbs inside the packets	8
1	my mother absolutely loves this tea it 's the only kind she will use i received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where i could purchase more and they told me they do n't sell to the public my mom was very upset i then went on to amazon \( which was great for all my christmas shopping \) who put me in touch with bently so my mother had a wonderful christmas ! ! !	8
1	these pods are excellent ! same taste as your favorite coffee shop at a fraction of the price	8
1	best snack i 've found in years i keep these in my desk at work for a mid afternoon appetite curb highly recommended by all my family and friends	8
1	i'm not exactly sure how good these are for you \? \? \? but i do know they taste great ! ! i bought these because i never have time for breakfast in the morning and i'm also sort of a choco holic and these with coffee or better yet hot chocolate are excellent !	8
0	most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed they put no expiration date on the bags so i do n't even know if i was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way on top of this they were too spicy my dog seemed to enjoy it though the ahi tuna on the other hand was great	8
1	these cookies are great my kids love them i saved a bundle by ordering the case beware though i also ordered the peanut butter flavor in july06 and when they arrived at the end of july the expiration date on the case was aug06 i did n't have any problems with the classic the expiration date was nov or dec i ca n't remember off hand	8
1	i recently used it over a few smoked sable fillets tasty ! we also like the marinara so versatile flavorful and convenient	8
0	these are fine if they were n't supposed to have blueberries there are essentially none most pouches of the 24 do n't even contain a piece of blueberry when you do find one it 's a very nice taste with the peanut but sadly that 's very rare avoid this variety	8
0	i beat this mix longer than the 10 minutes suggested and it was still too runny to even stay in my angelfood cake pan it baked flat a disgusting rubbery texture and was completely inedible when i very nicely wrote about my concerns and to request a product refund the customer service person said they could not give me a refund and said thank you for your understanding huh \? \? i 'll never purchase any more of their products	8
0	this salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough it is pretty much inedible and when you do painstakingly gnaw on it it does n't release much flavor but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth i had the misfortune of ordering this and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched and i'm not sure what to do with them i even tried soaking the jerky and tried boiling it with some macaroni and nothing seems to soften this stuff up ! what a waste of money go for some beef jerky instead and if you need salmon eat it fresh or canned this product is a joke	8
1	this product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce it can be added to any rice or noodle dish or eaten plain with vegetables the taste is pleasing	8
1	love this stuff great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well no after taste at all	8
1	nice chewy texture not fossilized like the health food store bulk bin kind and great taste packaged as they are \( 2 resealable packages of 20oz each \) it 's a very economical buy too just store one in the 'fridge or freezer until you finish the first our kids like these better than raisins	8
1	its a shame they quit carrying it i would have reordered twice by now	8
1	we 1st found this coffee at a local store the local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that amazon sold it it has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well	8
1	zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12 some people may say it 's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby it 's very healthy and low in sugar currently i give it to my son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	8
1	i spend a lot of time in my van while out shooting wildlife photos i buy a case of bottled water and keep some of these individual packets of drink mix open a bottle of water and put in a packet of this drink mix and you have an instant refreshing drink very easy	8
0	i ordered the chocolate mint variety amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly however i ordered the cookies in early november and they arrived with a best when used by date of december 4 2006 they will expire less than a month after they arrived ! i'm not sure if this is amazon 's fault or not the cookies are shipped in the manufacturer 's back to nature box so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on amazon com	8
1	they went over well in our house the sugar content is semi low and the peanut butter has good protein	8

1	i'm a vegetarian and although my husband is n't he enjoys this soup just as much the tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture if you 're expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed however if you 've made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time saving substitute the tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals this soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach my local health food store charges 5 30 per box of 4 packets amazon sells it for 2 66 a box substantial savings	8
1	looks like it got squashed a little and i guess somebody opened the package because i think there was supposed to be a seal there since this is new but i checked everything inside it counted all of the peices and everything was there i tried one and its great this is a good buy for what you get i just got a damaged package but its not damaged that badly just the outside is a bit squased overhaull 4 stars out of 5 i will buy here again fast delivery thank	8

1	we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but do n't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something this is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot i also feel good about buying newman 's products because of the causes they support and all the money does n't go to corporate profits	8
1	great way to pass the day at work fresh and tasty	8

1	i 've tried several of the annie chun flavors and i liked most of them but the kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious ! this is the best packaged soup product of any kind that i have ever tried and i usually dislike canned or packaged soup products this is even better than my favorite canned brunswick stew that i have loved for so long ! it is moderately spicy but if you do n't mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up i could practically live off of this stuff ! thank you annie chun for making a packaged meal worth eating	8

0	the sell by date on a package was less than a month so that they would not go bad i felt like i needed to personally eat more than i would have i have a retail store and i need a bit more time on new products this was a costly mistake also the wholesale price from the business itself was the same as amazon 's price except amazon gave free shipping and a discount coupon worth ten bucks ! cool deal beans amazon ! as a retailer i would think that i would be able to get a better deal from betty lou 's or get a reasonable sell by date very tasty and addicting	8

1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	quickly became my favorite when it first came out tastes great and the milk does n't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals i also use it on ice cream to add crunch i would give it 5 stars but even though it think it 's great it is overpriced price here is about the same as out local safeway	8
0	we have been buying the melita buzzworthy dark roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied recently they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines i also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling at the time melita made these changes i believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good accordingly i rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars we are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee	8

0	i thought this might taste like parmeson crisps you get in restaurants i was wrong they taste burnt and are hard to swallow even when chewed thouroughly also still had quite a bit of sodium	8
1	hearty great tasting cereal has a whole grain flavor originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals \( which is better for my reduced carb diet \) but it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through amazon com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores	8
1	i bake 3 4 times per week and honestly can say that this product is great i tried it for the first time to make bread i almost cried my bread was the best i ever made i will buy it again for sure	8

1	i do n't normally review items but i had to write something on this because all of these it 's too salty comments are driving me crazy these are hardly salty at all there is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food my bag says its only 8 of your daily sodium which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving i'm a man so i personally think these could use more salt	8
0	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
0	there is no doubt that this tea does it 's job but the smell of it is awful i normally do n't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things but i have such an aversion to the smell of this tea it has a top note of moldy dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad the box says that it contains delicious sasparilla i do n't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all if you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it	8
0	my wife and two year old like this cereal however i find them to be extremely crunchy and unpleasant to eat i prefer the purely o 's just wish they came in an eco pack	8

0	i bought this item thinking i was getting a healthy snack the fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet not health	8
1	ever feel like you want that little something with your tea or coffee but you abstain because you 're on a diet \? that was a problem for me at least i 've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight well just when i 'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative along came dr kracker spelt muesli crackers ! they are all natural contain no white flour or sugar do have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea ! highly recommended	8
1	i will never make home made gumbo again this is so easy and good 30 minutes and you have great gumbo	8
1	bear naked is my favorite granola and fruit and nut is by far my favorite flavor i came across bear naked because one of my favorite breakfast 's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt when i went off of refined sugar i was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added bear naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup my favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture i recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat	8
0	i agree with the person who said it 's hard to chew and here is why disect your slim jim length ways there do you see the hair \? it is \( allegedly \) all made of cow hair gross ! that is the beef part i guess trans fat \( partially hydrogenated veg oil \) and some really long word chemicals to make mechanically separated beef and chicken what looks like hair taste good \? no thanks glad i did not buy 100 ! my dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog 's p peewww ! ! !	8
1	i ca n't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea the bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary the color and aroma are just lovely making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery i carry the bagged variety everywhere i go	8
1	this cereal taste delicious the chocolate pieces are not supper sweet and the chocolate is rather dark which goes well with the cereal	8
1	these 6 oz packs of organic california prunes have more flavor than the non organic brands they are also drier and firmer which i was n't sure i liked at first i quickly grew used to it and now i prefer them this way they are sweet and chewy the freshness date is 16 months in the future so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have you ca n't go wrong at this price for 12 bags this is one brand you can trust	8
1	twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor normally i would n't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time yet twinings seems to hold up well i love tea would drink 24 7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them	8
1	nice clean meyer lemon flavor these lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon chefs love using these lemons in recipes this flavor also makes a great lemon drop	8
1	these are slightly thicker than regular gluten cornflakes but still tasty do n't expect them to be sweet like frosted flakes they are just plain very good though and great in recipes	8
1	great flavor light and fluffy and good texture only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches unlike other gluten free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle	8
1	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
1	i first had these in alaska and when i returned my taste buds could n't stop thinking about them ! they are a great alternative to fast foods	8
1	i bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away the kids loved the choices the only downside was the portions were extremely small even for my 4 year old on average they ate two a day	8
0	it 's not terrible but it 's not very good for the price you can go to your grocery store and get one that is just as good if not better i sent 8 of the 9 packets back	8

1	i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it 's great i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but i am switching to this brand it 's just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up	8
1	i love these snacks especially the valdosta blend the others are good but lack the crunchy punch of the valdosta it 's a great snack or salad topper delicious and good for you	8
1	these are as close to the real thing as it gets i added chocolate chips to half of the batter and crasins \( dried cranberries \) to the other half i have had celiacs for almost 2 years now and these are the best gluten free product i have eaten ! i had to hide them from the rest of my family b c they liked them as well !	8
1	i discovered these a few months ago and now i eat them for breakfast everyday the nutrition info is good and so is the taste	8
1	we recently ordered a case of this cereal from amazon and are down to our last box now ! my husband and daughter have celiac and i do n't but i eat more of it than they do it 's really that good	8
1	i have never ordered anything such as this online i was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take i will consider ordering again once i have used these up the walnuts were so fresh and nice not all broken up as some have been when i have purchased them at the grocery store	8
0	the newly re packaged twinings earl grey tea \( has the word classics on the package \) is much much weaker than the previous twinings earl grey tea if you used and like to the old teas then you wo n't like the new version i wonder if they have weakened the britsh version of twinings earl grey tea	8
1	pros very tastynatural \( no preservatives \) cons difficult to che	8
1	i tried this snack tonight and it was all i could do not to eat the whole bag well the night is young so i probably will i love the flavors and the spiciness of it	8
1	i drink this stuff religiously it tastes great with very little bitterness coming through even when over steeped the yogi quotes are fun too	8
1	i tried betty lou 's spirulina ginseng balls because i read the nutritioninformation and you get 40 of your daily requirement for vitamin a inone serving at this point in my quest to eat healthier i 've read lotsand lots of nutrition labels finding this much vitamin a in a snack israre finding something deep green in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare if you 're looking for a yummy sugery snack thisis not for you ! if you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie this snack is worth checking out	8
1	these are a delicious and nutritious snack ! my husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious the all bran bars are great too keep up the good work kellogg	8
0	i was going to buy these until i saw that they contained trans fats \( partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in cocoa crispies fruit loops and corn pops \) who wants to send their kids off to school loaded up with deadly trans fats \?	8
1	hardley any bad ones in the whole bag i bought these through figis and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them plus they cost more	8
1	these cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box they taste like real butter and fresh ingredients and they just about melt in your mouth i 'll be buying these again	8
0	really dry and just not as good as could be a disappointment after using this companys other products	8
1	these bars are filling which is what i look for in my snacks breakfast foods they 're nice and sweet wo n't fall apart on you like granola bars yet do n't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite it 's the perfect consistancy a great way to get some portable protien if you do n't want to carry around a bag of nuts seeds with you	8
0	i was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing big mistake to me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids the high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add	8
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	8
1	this is my favorite side dish it is so versatile and so very easy to make it tastes great with any and every kind of sausage i 've ever tried i love to make it when i whip up a batch of hot wings	8
1	i have ordered these twice now they taste so good ! i also tried the chocolate wheat free ones they were awful i would not order them again but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked	8
0	sadly this is pretty crummy tea for decent orange pekoe i remain sold on typhoo	8
0	the title is wrong this item contains twelve 5 grams \( 0 0175 ounce \) packets not twelve 5 ounce packets	8
1	i love the taste of this cereal if you like the puffed wheat sold in grocery stores for decades you too may find you love the fresh vibrant taste of these over sized grains of puffed delight best served in very cold whole organic milk i think i will go eat some now	8
0	this is a terrible tasting bar i have tried many raw bars and this one is by far the worst i 've ever tasted it leaves an after taste	8
1	i love andy capp steak fries but be warned about long shipping times it has been two weeks since my order and i have n't received the product i do n't know if fedex style shipping would have helped	8
0	it is not the wonderful twinings earl grey you have come to know and love they have pulled a new coke blunder and now the best earl grey tea ever is available no more ! this tea is weak and tasteless i hate stupidity especially from corporate marketers	8
1	these snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery the taste resembles that of cottage cheese a little under salted for my taste but still great watch out for blobs of undissolved jalape o mix you probably do not want to bite into those	8
0	this is a strong blend when i want a cup of decaf i usually want a milder blend and after a cup or two of this blend i still seem to get jittery i question whether or not it is truly decaffeinated	8
1	excellent taste and texture the apples are the crunchiest but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture if you really like your crunch i 'd go for the all apple product my only disappointment is that you 're not getting a lot for your money i love the convenient portion control packaging but 1 10 for a 3 4 ounce 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon so i 'll order more but these have become an occasional snack and not an everyday one	8
1	this stuff is delicious ! i 've been buying it for years as a good quality fairly nutritious snack food for myself \( i feed the kids veggie booty and hog the sweet stuff \) and it seems to be a pretty good choice it does n't take a lot to satisfy and it 's not really that bad for you \( sugar sure but not as much as some other treats \)	8
0	i was very disappointed in this product i wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts but they are too stale to use they are not crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging unfortunately amazon will not let me return them so i'm out 20 i was going to try some other products by this brand but now i will not	8
1	the granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet however the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing it has a crunchy texture the manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste the prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive 12 bars go quick i recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk the bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage the bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid morning and later in the day	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	so these are basically ritz bits but with three differences 1 the crackers are better they taste more buttery and flavorful 2 the cheese is better it actually tastes like something that 's met cheese in passing and maybe even shaken its hand 3 they 're all organic 'n' stuff so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous and less like a slave to big food if you 're packing lunches for kids \( or snacks for yourself \) these are great	8
1	this is an incredible set for tea and some incredible tea at more than half the price it is a nice organic store you might find it at \( no offense to organic stores but a 200 mark up is a little much \) this tea is the best ive ever had great for a gift as well id get one for yourself and a couple for birthdays and whatever comin up	8
1	this spread is way too good ! my husband and i have both tried spreading it on toast but it really stands alone i like to eat it just straight out of the jar the spread is a perfect blend of flavors if you have a sweet tooth and do n't always have other sweets on hand a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings unfortunately this spread has no nutritional value to speak of so i doubt i will order it again 6 jars is plenty for us you have to order it at least once though !	8
0	i am sensitive to wheat gluten and i swear this product has gluten everytime i eat a bowl of it i get sick i bought tons of this cereal because it does taste good but now i do n't know what to do with it because i ca n't eat it i think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel somehow it is getting contaminated i wish i could send it back it is too bad because it is a good product it 's just not gluten free	8
0	then this is n't for you horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that i definately do n't care for not to say that you will not however if you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee this is n't the one to try	8
1	i thought this was great but it just was n't as competitively priced as i would have hoped for buying a case from amazon so delicious though when i make it for people they ca n't believe it 's a mix	8
0	this snack \( lol \) tastes like cheese that had been baked in the oven for about a month kinda looks like it too make sure you have a beverage near by when you try them very very dry	8
1	we bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea it 's a great bargain if you 're a tea drinker ! ! ! \)	8
0	i opened one packet \( which was quite large for a serving and shared it with 3 others in my office we all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible no one could continue eating it and i sent back 8 of the 9 packets not edible in our humble opinion sorry	8
1	i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice you shall not be disappointed	8
1	we love the taste of illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine smooth never bitter and the vacuum packed canister has a unique reusable design	8
1	these are sweet and crunchy and i love them my only concern is the price at a dollar a piece it 's a little more than my buget allows for a snack luckily one packet is usually big enough for me to split for my kids	8
0	i tossed it out the texture is aweful and brittle only a few pieces were over 2 inches long and there was some sand like grit making it completely unedible gross ! you get what you pay for	8
1	the other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste where i agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge ! ! this cereal is excellent for taste consistancy and it is gluten free ! if you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin !	8
0	i too like the old smucker 's filled strawberry better \( aka fruit wheats \) this is ok but fruit filling is better they probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff	8
1	i am crazy about splenda i mix equal parts splenda and brown sugar for my hot cerael it saves money and calories asparteem \( nutrasweet \) gives me loose bowels splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories	8
1	my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream these are a bit softer than the o 's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat ! \) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too yummy	8
1	my two year old loves these and prefers them over goldfish i did a taste test with goldfish and the cheddar bunnies seem cheesier they seem less dry too	8
1	i received it quickly and was happy with the delicious alternative to plain granola it 's a healthy snack that 's great on yogurt and a good alternative to other cereals	8
1	as anyone who has tried bahlsen hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name a nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream just a sidebar no detraction from how tasty these cookies are	8
0	i 've purchased this locally and it was delicious so i was happy to see a deal offered by amazon unfortunately it never made it to my door ups reported that the sauce was leaking out of the box and returned the package to amazon this seems to match what many other reviewers said	8
1	i'm a huge white tea fan and regularly keep more than five varieties at any given time clipper 's organic white tea with peppermint is easily one of the best of any type of teas the flavor is balanced well defined and makes for smooth sippin	8
1	if you are ever in the mood for summer sausage but do n't feel like cutting a piece off of a large log these are the ticket they have a great taste and are the perfect the snack ! highly recommended !	8
1	these are great and taste just like the real thing	8
0	i was very disappointed with this product i was sure i had tried cherries from this company but these had an off flavor were extremely sweet i gave away the 4 bags i bought	8
1	my son \( 3 \) and i love these he likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them he likes all the bunny graham varieties \( chocolate honey cinnamon \) they taste like the traditional graham crackers	8
1	this is a great cereal it is very similar to crispex only a whole lot better for you	8
1	i am a south beach diet follower and these crackers are a perfect choice to fit the guidelines of the diet and they are delicious ! they are quite expensive in stores so i'm very excited to see amazon offering them at such a great price	8
0	after searching high and low i found a site for 'nossa familia coffee' that carries a coffee that is imported directly from a farm in brazil ! i guess this family has won the cup of excellence competition and they put their top coffees in the senseo compatible pods the site is www familyroast com and i highly recommend i	8
0	the main ingredient should be salt ! 750mg per serving and there are 2 servings per can come on we usually sweat or need more salt in the summer but we tend to eat more soup in the winter my first impression was boy this is salty it would be great as a gravy but so is a much cheaper cambell 's cream of mushroom	8
1	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
0	i'm afraid i disagree with the other two reviews i thought this pasta was extremely bland and not very close to what wheat pasta tastes like it does take longer to cook and you have to add oil to the water and stir it quite frequently or it clumps and sticks together terribly it 's an ok substitute but there are much better gluten free pastas out there although the glutino is cheaper i personally like orgran pasta 100 times better	8
1	my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy \? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon 's price is great \( just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas	8
0	as if metalcore wasnt a chainsaw to your head enough its absolutely ridiculous when metalcore bands mix emo with there already inoriginal sound this band sounds like a even more flaccid killswitch engage a hawthorne heights silverstein with downtuned guitars as if it wasnt an abomination already they even sing about vampires yes thats right vampires and you couldnt get any g yer	9
0	don`t waste your time and money on this compilation what a cheap shot to take the consumers money read the very fine print it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it shame on the distributor !	9
1	anais is one of the best cingers i have seen her since objetivo fama and she is just great do n't listen to people who say this cd is bad because the are just hating this cd is just great	9
0	if you are buying this because you love rob be aware this is the rob wearing his goblin cock hat if you are n't familiar with this incarnation let 's just say it ai n't the rob of pinback or heavy vegetable fame same guy different sensitivity i fell in love with rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there on this outing rob has met the enemy and it is himself he 's entitled to do as he pleases and you and i are entitled to not care for it this cd is not an acquired taste it is a forced feeding	9
1	hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance even better than tuckwell 's the cadenzas are absolutely awesome i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy i'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician highly recommended	9
1	this is a fantastic album the fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release \( and they 're not the beatles or u2 or anything \) should speak volumes i have played this cd countless times over the years and i am amazed that i am not sick of it i am a pretty constant consumer of new music get this cd you wo n't regret it ! \( ps i 've never done an amazon review before but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me \) it is melodic catchy uplifting and cheeky in short a little piece of musical bliss	9
0	no strings attached is to my memory one of the worst albums ever made no one listens to the stupid boy bands anymore this piece of c p does not sell even a thousand copies today unless the previous reviewer is buying up all the million copies himself dont buy any album from n stync or the equally horrible justin timberlake get any beatles album instead	9
1	though i own alot of paul desmond recordings this one as been in the cd changer for weeks now there 's great gentle interplay with jim hall and a total sound that is most enjoyable warm and round notes make this perfect evening music which i have found pleases most everyone	9
1	i just want to say that this record blows my mind ! only the japanese could come up with this musical hybrid that defies definition only miss minekawa could inject such beautiful innocence into this thrilling aural rollercoaster of breaks samples and guitars cornelius and dj me dj you are brilliant	9
0	unfortunately ttd went off the deep end on this album consequently he put off many fans from buying the brilliant next album quot symphony or damn quot and the superb follow up quot vibrator quot if you loved the first album give this one a miss and get the two i just mentioned come on ttd hurry up and release a new album	9
0	i love to hear old standards and such but i like to hear people who put their own take on it i ca n't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some frank sinatra wannabe where are the male versions of nora jones \? tone down the cheese ! we need more people like sophisticated shirley horn and betty carter \( not hams like buble dusk or boring singers like diana krall but what can i expect from the music industry \? rarely do the best song stylists get lots of attention so hmmm nevermind i guess it 's always been that way	9
1	link this cd of great melodies with the best of the browns \( 1954 1967 \) you 'll not regreat the quality such easy listening this group is simply the best i also suggest reading maxine brown 's book looking back to see a country music memoir it 's a well written \( and interesting \) cover of the the history of the browns	9
0	i wo n't dispute emmylou 's wonderful voice and mark knopfler 's superb guitar playing but this album just did n't cut it for me pretty lame about as likely as hank and phoebe snow	9
1	if you are a fan of the winter 's solstice series than you will enjoy this cd especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music	9
0	not exactly the vaults blowing open as stated in the promo these are mostly leftovers and one offs from the late 1990s when the group was on hiatus from serious recording that 's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows literary journals and graphic design firms whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected such as reprehensible rest awhile and certain people i could name but there are too few of these real songs and they 'd have fit a lot better on that long awaited b sides collection from their major label career	9
1	never mind the fact that jay introduced the jazz world to charlie parker his band rocked ! after basie nobody swung like mcshann this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40 's small band jump blues sides anything by this man is worth listening to another great disc by the proper label who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price highly recommended	9
0	i agree complete with erik cobbett this is covenant 's most unnecessary and boring album ever there are a couple of nice parts on it but generally it 's a big disappointment	9

1	not speaking or understanding tibetian did n't lessen the joy of being totally absorbed by this wonderful movie and the music from this soundtrack is the reason why it guides you like a sherpa gently leading you along the high trails powerfully pulling you to the heights of ever thinning air you are at once engulfed in the tibetian life you live the experience through the deep gutteral chants singing bowls and drums	9
0	if i ca n't buy the cd with all the songs that were played in the movie then i wo n't buy it i know one cd could cover the entire movie so why ca n't this be done \? does it concern copy rights and releases	9
0	this album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky wacky vivid personality of the first three galactic studio albums this is boring flat and generic is that stanton moore or a drum machine \? precede straight to garage a trois	9
0	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst and how dare him to diss krs one he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 he just added to why he sucks lets face it all his songs are basically dumb and and really don t have much texture involved and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable if you buy this album you throw away good money unless you like bubblegum rap this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool but lets face it its played out	9
0	i found the music rather annoying it was not what i expected at all	9
0	though these are the songs that make the mills brothers famous they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals \( certainly they are considerably older \) these are ok but they lack the punch and familiarity \( to a fan like myself \) of the originals the title though not actually misleading leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs they are not i recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills brothers records	9
1	great anniversary present fav song i love the way you love me my husband loves to listen to it in the car	9
0	this air supply should 've been cut off a very long time ago whenever any of their songs comes on the radio i immediately shut it off bad ear candy is all they ever recorded mindless sappy garbage even bread 's music was more interesting than this	9
0	while some would call orange and acme studio albums suggesting that they lack originality but they have rythm i would call myself a big jsbx fan i play orange and acme constantly however i feel that this album is a little too much free form and free noise for the everyday listener i would recommend that anyone interested in jsbx start with acme and then move on to orange to develop an appreciation for jsbx because it is a rather acquired taste	9
0	sinceramente no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas incluso renombrados artistas hacia este musico ungido de la leyenda grape amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados lastima piedad curiosidad no se me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson \( 13th \) en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio en fin son opiniones nada mas	9

0	as long as artists keep making albums with only one good song people will keep getting them for free in internet nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop pop commercial elevator music if you like that kind of music buy this cd otherwise buy hubert laws or dave valentin among others if you want to listen to good nestor music buy morning ride dance of the phoenix talk to me mi alma latina or the charanga album mis canciones primeras sorry nestor i am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff when do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album	9
0	i own this set as does my roomate and we both hate it it highlights bands like 'red lorry yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to and uses great classic bands like bauhaus' worst song as the first track it is the hollow tin y embarrassingly hokey side of goth and i am ashamed to even have it in my house	9
1	how dare you compare oasis to phil collins phil collins sucks and oasis rules ! how come you do n't get the message \? you 're retarded	9

0	i got hooked on tiesto about 5 years ago heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album neverhteless it was n't but it was still tiesto though right \? well the hits on this cd are about 5 years old the build ups are terrible and i felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists stick with tiesto nyana 10130340345435 times better	9
1	tame 's music is all about the beat it 's what got me right from the start a grinding repetitious backbone to every song tame one rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery tame gets rid of the verse hook standarda periodically ad libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing its an amazing album well worth purchasing	9
0	reba is not country anymore period ! ! this cd will prove that just listen to the first track which i think is horrible as a matter of fact i think the whole cd is horrible not deserving of reba 's talent	9

1	as one of the founding fathers of today 's heavy metal rock music iron butterfly has them power drive and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music this live album serves as a testament to that fact eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960 's through the mid 1980 's was primative at best \( by today 's standards \) this live recording of iron butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart topping group of that era this is a must have for all iron butterfly fans	9
0	blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit elefant 's lyrics i personally like interpol and the strokes i resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs	9
1	percy grainger was a man of spectacular gifts he was one of the most original composer arrangers in the early part of this century he was also a spectacular pianist in an age of spectacular pianists this amazing cd documents grainger 's formidible gifts it cannot be over praised both the music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover 's attention do n't miss this one	9

0	after really enjoying the amici forever album i went shopping for another amici album and found this one there really is no comparison between the two i 've tried listening to it several times to see if i'm missing something but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the lawrence welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe i was very disappointed	9
1	what i love most about scofield 's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style he is careful not to over do it while still demonstrating skill and precision his riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed the only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding songs i rarely make it to the end of this cd still for those who enjoyed quot a go go quot this one is quite similar so make sure to pick it up this quality funk cd with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking but is a great casual listen \( guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas here !	9
1	i 've been a robben ford fan since 1979 each time he offers a new recording i try to purchase it as quickly as possible robben can rock and play slow blues every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again i ca n't say enough ! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation ! if you like robben ford do n't miss chris cain this man is also a guitar genius	9
0	i never could understand why the beatles are so popular \? they are pretty boring too just like pink floyd each and every song on this album can put me to sleep in about 55 seconds i just dont like it because it sucks ! dont listen to the moronic 5 star reviewers below the beatles only made one good album and that 's the one which contains ballad of john and yoko hey jude	9
1	immerse yourself in the incredible genius of mark o'connor and his amazing chameleon like creative ability to tease so many different moods and styles from his violin if you like cajun music this is for you if you like western swing this is for you if you like foot tapping fiddle with a celtic slant then this is for you ! classical \? jazz \? blues \? country rock \? then yeah you guessed it this is for you ! this is an absolutely fantastic album a brilliant collection of melodies that bring together some of today 's greatest violinists pure genius	9
1	really enjoyed hearing all of them again there is some great talent on here i hope they all get their own opportunities ! i do think in some cases there are some better songs to show off these great singers voices	9

1	this album is a classic but its really short dead prez are the best duo in rap in my opinion i highly recommend this and all of dead prez 's other albums	9
0	i can understand that robin felt a need to include some of the biggest bee gees hits to appease the fans but the ones that were sung by barry are below wretched here robin frequently disappears in the sound mix becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony that 's fine for a group concert like the bee gees but inexcusable for a solo effort his stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act they should have kept this in the can it seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for robin do n't do him the favor	9

0	after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc was n't worth the effort i'm afraid velveeta on wonder bread dull collection of acid jazz duds not bad as background noise for your next dinner party but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act a pass for all but galactic completeists if such an animal exists	9

0	however despite what amazon reviewer kristy martin may believe ms croft does not need to get her freak on wow i guess hip hop can do no wrong in a soundtrack which is filled with apporpriate trax to supplement the film here comes another fanboy girl of hip hop 's hopele ley misplaced garbage thank you kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along \( missy \) this song is soo done it 's practically taboo to listen too and outkast \? puhf ckingleez these clowns sold out a long long time ago	9
1	this is one of those rare cds that you 'll leave in your car cd player for months and not get tired of because it fits most moods feels like melissa etheridge meets cheryl crow with an old blues feel here and there and some nice heavy tori amos like piano and vocals here and there too	9

1	all i have to say is great album	9
0	i read several different on line reviews for this cd before i purchased it each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature strange i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her like my title line to this review states it 's the exact same music she has always sang just in a different package now the cd just collects dust what a shame	9
1	too bad this group supported by keith sweat did n't go any further i bought it for one song but the whole cd is great for listening lyrics contain songs about love and such and i like they way speak about it it gives you something to look forward to	9
0	generally harmless except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents the song is probably funny to ultra sophisticated cynical adults but the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old i would n't bring this cd into your house	9
1	sweet brazillian jazz piano combined with guaraldi 's 1960 's hit quot cast your fate to the wind quot throw in a coupla classics like quot since i fell for you quot and quot moon river quot masterfully interpreted by vince and you have the perfect album for unwinding loving or waking up	9
0	lonestar did n't really surprise me with their 2001 effort i'm already there and not a day goes by suffers from amazed syndrome amazed 's 1999 multi format mega success is spread all over this album their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad did they listen to monster ballads 2 too much while making this album in nashville \? i'm already there comes off as very diane warren ish in its sappy lyrics their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay but these songs do n't work for them these songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this	9

0	back 2 da basics 1 2 starsyo gotti has made some decent albums but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map has some good songs here and there but the rest are just ridiculous obnioxus and real pretentious this is not a good albumthumbs down	9
1	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something you could n't do better than to give them this cd ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer this is not a bad thing some complain that bach with his mathematical leanings leaves them cold that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd	9
0	gonzalo is a fantastic pianist this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side however it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments if driving later in the day i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste but it is exciting not here there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well now some will like the gentleness i suppose but with weak material and not much diversity it sits pretty flat with me	9
0	being a huge blondie fan i want to rate this one higher but sadly i cannot it 's just a sad mishmash of bad songs it feel very negligant too i love the way blondie contributed to rap and disco but their calypso number on this one is so awful they had lost it here check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat	9
1	i have seen joe many years ago when he had played in a group called bloodline and he is even better now	9

0	i like machine head a lot many people disliked the burning red and called them sell outs but i appreciated the effort to make something different then came supercharger i have listened to it a dozen times looking for that hook or spark that will get me to listen and love it it never came this is a bad cd by a great band	9

0	ana carolina is a good singer and seu jorge is a cult culture figure here in brazil but this cd is a mistake do not spend money on this	9

1	this has been my first cd of rod stewart and i am very proud to have this cd because worth every penny this cd has class congratulations to the men behind the duet with cher bewitched bothered bewildered is the best song duet with queen latifah as time goes by i was astonish she has a nice voice too ! ! all songs are relaxings actually i listen this cd before to go bed	9
1	i first heard this album in the late 6o 's when it was originally released starting with the first track quot blood of the sun quot i was hooked leslie west was and has been a vastly unnoticed guitarist treasure his throaty singing and driving band featuring felix pappalardi made this band one that should be placed on the list of quot great ones quot probably due to the many other better publicized bands like led zeppelin and the like leslie west and mountain seemed to get shoved away into the closet open the closet you guitarists out there and give this cd a try i do n't think you will be anything but delighte	9
1	if you are looking for true hip hop this is a must for your collection four of the best lyrist in the game is all on one cd quit buying those fake ass hip pop albums and get the real deal from the production to mcing its all there matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you 'll have a fresh one in the stacks	9
1	this album came out about 8 years before i was born all the years i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album this is mj in his prime unfortunately we will never get another epic like this again michael is sadly a target in the media but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not every song off here is a classic one song i thought was unneccesary was baby be mine but otherwise it 's excellent if you starting an mj collection get this album first trust me	9
1	this is a must have for anyone with an r b oldies collection you wo n't be disappointed	9
1	quite different from his later big band recordings some of the songs that you may find on wes' 'best of' collections sound too much like elevator music not so with this debut album a drummer a organist and a guitar player no horn section stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing he shows of his trade mark octave playing his chord solos \( played over the organs rythm chords none the less \) and flashy runs across the fret board when needed a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz	9
0	the cd came as promised and in the condition promised i'm very satisfied	9
0	this was the worst thing i 've ever heard except maybe clap your hands say yeah my cousin who has absolutely no musical taste introduced me to them and i hate them forever	9
0	it' curious how an interesting history can be not well told by a modern music in some cases the music go to the hand with the story but not in this cd in which we say the music that it is not for the story i did n't ejoyed with that c	9
0	oh this is pure adult garbage all right i have never heard a more disguisting piece of music then this then again the movie was garbage also	9
0	this is another rip off cd 3 songs and a video do n't make this a good purchase i expect a cd to have at least 8 10 songs on it	9
1	i'm a huge matchbox fan and i listen to a collection of all 3 albums all day long i never get tired of it ! rob thomas has such a powerful voice that it just beckons to me his lyrics are soul searching and speak directly to me what a great band ! what a great album ! what a great musical ride !	9
0	it is bad ! as much as i like 10 new songs this one disappointed me a lot	9
0	just another cd of the awful awful techno crud that has infested goth industrial clubs while real artists like cinema strange and knifeladder get the shaft worthless on every level	9
1	i have been a brickman fan since the very first album much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much electronic enhancement escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums there are three excellent vocals on the cd that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano if you are a brickman fan this is a must have album	9
1	this album is a great representation of what spoon is about great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind the two sides of monsieur valentine sister jack and i turn my camera on i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock definately money well spent	9
0	unfortunately i forked out 14 for this cd upon first listen i am extremely dissapointed being a huge fan of sp for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of green 's previous work also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist use this as sunday background music on a rainy day but do not expect to get the party started with this album	9
1	i'm just starting to become a true fan of pigpen earlier i just did n't get him and i would constantly skip forward to more of the gd extended jams lately i 've started to get what he was all about and what made him such an important part of the early dead shows i'm glad i picked up this set it 's pigpen 's night and we should all be happy for this nice memory pick it up note the rest of the band has some fine moments too ! !	9
0	i have to admit i expected a lot more from mr setzer the first track was ok then it proceeded to go down hill from there not much rockabilly happening then it all comes clear with really rockabilly when he slags off all his traditional rockabilly fans world wide he even gives us aussies a serv even though i do n't think he has ever set foot here if brian wants to turn his back on rockabilly and try swing jazz rock or whatever then go ahead but why slag your old fans \? it 's the last time i buy one of his cds without listening to it first	9
0	is n't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of al jolson \? the problem with so many new traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience hippies and white liberals love it but where does that leave those that are living it \? far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas south of the border and east la 's lysa flores north of the border	9
0	even as dedicated of a radiohead fan as i am i really do n't care much for this album i say thank goodness for creep because we may have never heard from them again \( or at least not in the same way \) if that song had not become as popular as it did	9
0	if you are looking for boring lifeless adult contemporary music then this cd is for you if you are looking for a great guitar cd this is n't it i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion but all winning streaks must come to an end and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this of all the eric clapton cds that i like this is n't one of them i'm glad clapton is now in a happy place \( and deservedly so \) but this cd just does n't do it for me	9
1	i was looking for a cd that i could listen to all of the time oh my god i am breathless i was brought to tears as they sang mama my mother passed away in 2002 and i never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all all of il divo 's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could thank you for touching my heart i really recommend that you give this cd a chance all of these other people on the board that gave it a low score obviously need a hearing aid and a heart blessing	9
1	this album has morse code on it what more can you say well some of that morse code actually sounds like that ua6 you just worked on 40 metres complete with t6 buzz and slow drift and the music is pretty good too	9
0	quality is poor some songs are not playing avoid buying amazon	9
0	hey that just goes without being said all of their live albums suck because they suck go creed ! i ca n't wait for scott stapp 's solo album ! awesome baby	9
1	thoroughly enjoyed the cd have some of the songs as performed by other artists but it 's nice to hear them as performed by the writer i'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity	9
1	this is an amazing beautiful album probably a little more difficult to get into than streethawk but after about the 4th or 5th listen i found it more rewarding the music is very dense and the lyrics are beautifully poetic \( it helps that dan bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time \) a great album for any fan of intelligent independent music	9
0	bits of beatles zappa queen \( herman 's hermits \? \) may be laudable in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator elfman 's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal musical pieces they have fairly banal repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music has the creepy competence of a dave grusin album if you like that you 'll be ok here	9
1	this is a great movie soundtrack ! i'm a passport fan since i was a kid back in the 70 's i have all klaus doldinger 's official releases with his passport signature please go and look for this cd running in real time from passport and listen to track number 2 auryn then go and get all his passport releases \( almost 20 cds since the 70 's \) then you will see why klaus doldinger is very creative	9
0	i tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong i click on one song and get another from on the list what gives anyway	9
1	any one of the first 4 cuts on this album are worth the price of admission these pieces each melodically rich and honed like a fine gem remind me more of classical romanticism than what normally passes for quot new age quot sit back in a cosy armchair with a glass of wine and let this beautifully crafted music weave its web it 's quot feel good quot music that also has an intellectually satisfying bittersweet flavor	9
0	this is not i repeat not five stars ! in all honesty it 's more like 1 5 or 2 stars and i'm a big fan of slug atmosphere albums like overcast godlovesugly the felt project and the dynospectrum album is much better than this though the lyrics are thought provoking but slug has been better the production does n't hold up it 's some of the weakest i 've heard from rhymesayers there 's only a couple tracks that stand out but i 'd have to say do n't ever f king question that is the best if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album slug spits classic verse after classic verse	9
1	this is the best cd i have ever listened to ! i highly recommend i	9
1	this arrived the other day i pre ordered it two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion its about time this was available on cd and here it is sounds great ! go get it for the collection	9
1	as always opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these bach cello suites starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this cd that this edition the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not technically perfect but in many ways his most mature interpretation you can spend hundreds trying to find a mercury copy of the perfect rendition or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist at the height of his humanistic understanding of music and of life	9
1	all i can say is you must try this !	9
1	one ca n't go wrong with this one a classic which according to the well written liner notes was recorded 3 days after opening night and a pit orchestra that sounds like a pit orchestra before the days of electronic music	9
1	forget the nit picky comments you may read here if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album buy it ! the recording is of very high quality and i agree with another review vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better the banter between the artists in between the musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these shows live one other observation if you buy this not having a huge appreciation for sammy already you will be blown away by his talent thanks to sinatra family for releasing this disc hopefully many more are forthcoming	9
0	this cd is boring and derivative to the point of being cynical a better alternative would be to listen to either a \) the original artists who influenced this bandorb \) someone at least trying to do something new with music to enjoy this cd you 'd have to really want to like this band either because you liked dig or because you 're attracted to their super cool reputation if you 're afraid you 're missing out on something by not owning bjm 's back catalogue do n't worry you 're not	9
1	this band reminds me of the thrill i first got when i listened to an atreyu album it dies today rip off the former bands style but they are still a very good band in the over crowded metalcore market of today that is a rarity my only complaint is that the vocalist has a beautiful singing voice \( as heard on the radiance \) but more often then not goes for the screams and growls that are associated with this type of music still 5 5 material though favorite songs the radiance freak gasoline fight our disintigration and the caitliff choir defeatism	9
0	metallica never recovered from the death of cliff burton as this album is prime evidence of he helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here also newstead only gets one song on this album which is ironically the best song on the album in the history of metallica this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial	9
1	the best r b band ever ! ! ! i know some will disagree with me but this is the band that really rock my boat i mean they were awesome and it was n't forced or fake the rawness of their funk is sooo addictive that you will never put this cd down i am in the process of getting all their cds but this one is a great way to be introduce to their music	9
1	like i said i would i finally got around to purchasing this cd i especially like tracks 9 12 cheap trick is solid as always i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases if i do have any criticism at all it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs i guess it 's hard to create new stuff after 30 years anyway there are some great tunes on this buy it like i did !	9
0	many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know but to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds this is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music another double ambient album seti pharos is a real masterpiece it is a real pity because the cover of this album is really stunning but you know never judge the cover by its album please if you have any feedback to this write to carlogiova yahoo it i would be happy to share thoughts	9
0	i bought this cd after having seen ken burns' special on pbs the energy that came through on screen in the benny goodman segments does n't really come through in this cd artie shaw said that benny goodman was too much of a perfectionist to take risks and so his music languished in predictability that shows in this collection afterall where would jazz be if jazz musicians did n't take risks	9
1	it realy has been a long wait after jellyfish this roger joseph manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way if you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel and do n't wait for the us release it lacks one song from a perfect 11 like the japanese has i sure would n't want to miss any of these tracks very higly recommended !	9
0	je suis un peu d u par cet album c'est morne le son est pas top a tra ne dans les longueurs bref ennuyeux ! mais bon il faut se mettre l' poque aussi ! a qd m me 13 ans	9
1	gene watson 's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for sonny james ernest tubb and dottie west i had never heard of him but then when i heard his voice on the cd i knew the songs it 's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should every song is great but the one which i really like is quot the old man and his horn quot this was a song i had never heard it also shows the versatility of gene 's song selections he has the best voice of any country singer i have ever heard	9
1	joan you do n't love me because i'm a guy but i have loved you since 1976 ok so i'm an old man \( age 43 \) so what she 's just the best rock and roll female on the planet i like the young ones like sahara hotnights and the donnas as well but they just do n't measure up to joan born to be bad jett this album like most of her other albums consists of a mix of old and new songs does n't mattar i love it and the video well it confirms what we have always known not that it matters the music matters	9
1	i dug the soundtrack better than the film the music sounds good through out if the film had have just focused on the music it would have been incredible the musicianship is solid here	9
1	this is their best album easily better than anything the likes of oasis ever managed richard iii going out late in the day and the title track are all top quality if you rated blurs 3 quot britpop quot \( horrible term really \) albums from the 90s then get this its up there with them simple as that	9
0	this cd had the makings of a great recording the problem was telling popper where they were performing ! butch please record another one but leave popper at home he 's full of a lot of things but talent is n't one of them	9
1	i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french the music is relaxing but not sleep inducing steven halpern composes great music	9
1	neil young 's latest release has some very clever and interesting songs they are very political so unless you are a completest who likes neil young if you agree with president bush this album will be a turn off for the politically neutral or those who agree with neil young this is a good album maybe this is not neil young 's best but it still is a good album	9
1	quem n o gosta de samba bom sujeito n o ruim da cabe a ou doente do p essa letra desse samba serve para definir melhor o cd da marisa monte quem n o gostar dele doente da cabe a do ouvido do corpo etc um trabalho dedicado na medida certa para esta cantora verdadeira diva da mpb recomendo a todos	9
0	i love south music like three 6 lil jon master p but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead man jd is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he ca n't get no one wit talent every song on here sounds like it was hurried up fu k so so de and fu k dem franchize boyz they make me sick	9
0	ryuichi sakamoto 's credibility is on the precipice with chasm a turgid unlistenable work of crud check out coro and only love can conquer hate both sound like factory machinery at work dire dreadful and diabolical stop being the artiste ryuichi and have a go at entertaining your fans deserve better	9
1	i am a motown oldies r amp b soul love songs music lover i like the songs that hit the heart and soul and hearing them brings back memories that come alive to the rhythem and bill withers definately fits right in there i do n't realy have a favorite artist because i like sooooo many of them but if i had to pick my top 10 this album would be in there	9
1	her voice takes my breath away i fell in love with her i highly reccomend it	9
0	after souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums \( a feat achieved by only a handful of bands \) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc the bunnymen built their reputation on moody psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in ocean rain for this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory eschewing album wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned if you 're new to the bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums \( crocodiles heaven up here porcupine and ocean rain \) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts evergreen and flowers	9
1	i am not jewish but you do n't have to be to enjoy these songs this album happens to be one of my favourites of the putumayo releases a couple of the songs were instantly familiar to me even though i thought i knew none of the songs when i bought this album each and every song on here is wonderful some are traditional folk songs while others are newer compositions the 23 page booklet includes a 3 page history of jewish music and each artist has a page about them including a photograph i highly recommend this album to just about everyone my husband is arabic and he too loves these songs music truly is borderless	9
1	this mos def album is a good album to listen to he shows off his lyrical skills and gives social commentary that is on point why listen to a bunch of guys who have lil in front of their names when you can listen to a man give his views on life love and this country we live i	9
0	too lisa loeb for me sorry maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics	9
1	fournier plays exquisitely imbuing each note with an elegance of its own and keeping the piece lyrical yet still rhythmically precise although his interpretation is romantic the spirit is all bach with no egoism on the part of fournier there is both serenity and tension in these recordings and fournier 's smooth interpretation is one of the most moving recordings available	9
0	please make these songs available to listen with windowsmedia !	9
1	the title says it all im so happy i bought it and i listen to it all the time	9
1	with all the 'neuvo flamenco' and its accompaning popularity it is nice \( and a relief \) i might add to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form not only does this cd contain sabicas and nino ricardo it also contains four very rare perfomances by manolo de huelva which are difficult to find anywhere also included are melchor de marchena performing six pieces this is truly pure flamenco at its best	9
0	paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music however content on his latest project white sand is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums the artist collaborations on white sand make it tempting to purchase but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility \( smooth latin or r b \) are lacking overall it is still a cd worth paying for	9
1	another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson the album released on blues notes features lou 's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones lou even opts to 'chill' out on a number called 'over the rainbow' but on other numbers like 'donkey walk' lou 's style and also his unique band really shine the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album keep on funkin mr lou donaldson ! ! ! !	9
1	this album is the foudation of modern hip hop the format of the album the presence of rakim his image everything was new territory when this album came out in 86' all hip hop lovers should have this album especially people down south	9
0	i purchased empty not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable but eventually forgettable pop rock this sophomore effort is simply put amatuer and sub par some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as empty b sides while the cover of electric avenue never really distracts most listeners from thinking what is this and why \? over all this might appeal to most christian radio listeners but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is mold fitting white noise	9
1	i love this show so much ! ! it just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well ! ! sutton foster as jo was cast very well its obvious she deserved that tony nomination in 2005 and the sisters even though they were n't the leads they all had such great songs especially beth whose song some things are meant to be always brings tears to my eyes its just so touching i would definitely recomend this cd to anyone who loves musical theatr	9
1	i never have understood how some people have an inate quality for music and some do n't well willie was one of those that definately did it is hard to imageine the blues without the likes of willie dixon the writer the musician the producer the businessman i listen to his work over and over again each time learning new nuances i did not hear before how incredible is that	9
1	this is a fantastic holiday christmas album doris day 's beautiful voice singing these terrific christmas songs make for a beautiful sound that will bring all who listen years of enjoyment a must have for those who enjoy hearing terrific christmas music over the holidays	9
1	wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album its just that darn good of a song but hey the whole album is good the title track is brutally awesome especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd \( iron maiden box set \) and murders in the rue morgue is another classic then there is drifter and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan \( who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort \) maybe not as good as their debut album but still a masterpeice of an album	9
1	this is what music is all about the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note or the raspy delicious vibrato of vocalist david sylvian it makes me melt and feel so good and pure think if tweaker were to make jazz and really chill out this is what it would sound like you 'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet ever there is everything one could want possibly the perfect record it 's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul absolutely brilliant and definitely essential one of my favorites from the year	9
1	there are plenty of reasons to get this dead album one is the fact that this is probably the best recorded psychedelic cd of all time it was the first rock album recorded on a 16 track in fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology the remaster is splendid another good reason is the great bonus tracks almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your suv to the record store can you dig it	9
1	this book helps toddlers put into context how they fit into the animal kingdom and the natural things all animals do it teaches them to be comfortable with without shame the move from being a diaper clad baby to a big kid the drawings are charming ! i bought this book for a friends who runs a day care center and got a very positive reaction	9
0	if you need an experience of pure meaningless noise this one 's for you however dont expect it to change your life much the price listed above for the album is a very good example of the old cliche you get what you pay for	9
1	ummm if you buy it you will know i borrowed it from a friend and he never got it back so i bought him another	9
1	this is a wondrful cd and quite a bargin two discs and the very best of nancy wilson i liked so much i bought two and gave one to a friend	9
0	while well produced i was disappointed in the album mostly because the majority of the tracks were re recordings frankie laine still sounds great but it just was n't the same i bought the cd to replace a well worn vinyl album but on listening to the cd i found the songs to all be slightly \( and in a couple of cases very \) different in tempo and vocal inflection it 's definitely not the album i 've loved for over 30 years ! high noon in particular is quite different much slower with vocal emphasis changed i 'll probably listen to the cd from time to time but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp	9
1	this is my favorite jazz album of all time put simply this was miles davis at his best the notes on this album simply float and yet it flows together better than anything i 've ever heard the composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense do n't let the thirty second clips fool you i almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading i took a chance on it and it was the best gamble i 've ever made a must have for any jazz enthusiast	9
0	i played several samples of this cd on my computer while visiting the amazon website and my male cat started meowing along this cd is good for calming a cat and lining his box face it yoko ca n't sing \( unless you have a cat 's ears \)	9
1	i was in walmart 's electronic area \( which is where you can usually find me ! \) and i saw the album i heard unbelieveable and i was sold on that song but could n't find the single the album on first listen was not my favorite but after a while i started liking it it is a great album and i'm glad i bought it talent is a virtue !	9
1	a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago i listened to a few minutes of it and was like what is this crap \? and i shelved it for a couple months i then picked it back up and gave it another listen to my surprise it was really catchy to me the music \( and lyrics \) are simple but thats what i like about them theyre simple ! this is a great college rock cd i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub and i suggest you do the same notable tracks are sidewinder what you do to me and is this music \?	9
0	well ok mehldau 's arrangements are n't bad he does a great version of paranoid android but otherwise where's the energy \? there 's really not a whole lot of excitement or energy in this album and i do understand this as being a more laid back mellowed out album but it is still possible to be more exciting energetic or emotional in this style all three of these things are pretty much absent from this cd which ends up making it dull yawn	9
0	yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs girls cars and jewelery i tell you juelz really came with an original formula with this album the stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset lol ! ! ! ! these guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat save your money	9
0	this album is not what i call a album first 4 trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats best track on here is quot i practice looking hard quot probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career i love that song but otha than that quot captain save a hoe quot and quot mail man quot are a discrace he shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track	9
0	all the cds this band has made suck not even the first one so never buy something this idiots have made blink 182 sugarcult or sum 41 are good punk pop	9
1	i have listened to the cuts from this cd and was amazed at how quickly it transported me back to the time there were several tracks that i was delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an entire album re released if you are in a mood for a good dose of nostalgia this is the set for you !	9
0	item never came however in their defense refund was promptly given out i only wish that i had a chance to receive this one	9
1	for those who have watched the movie jaws \( ask yourself who has n't \) will know that one of many key elements that made the movie a huge success was the fantastic score john williams did for it this cd captures all the music from the movie perfectly with some new elements thrown in that are not found in the film the linear notes are bright and colourful and provide some interesting information which gives the overall package a nice touch the overall cd package is certainly not a rushed effort and is worth every cent a highly recommended purchase for those who love their soundtracks or anyone who wants to relive the film through the music	9

1	i just love this cd over 8 years ago my much older coworker turned me onto this album it is definetly not just for st paddy 's day this is an album you can listen to over and over the sinead songs are a bit whiney but she does have an excellent voice you can not get better that mic and sting sting 's song is just incredible	9

1	i used to be a bigger fan of joe satriani than steve vai about 10 years ago now i quickly get bored of new satriani albums but vai 's music just moves me lotus feet for example wow words cannot describe what that song does to me thanks steve	9
0	this was not as good as i had hoped and half of it is too slow to listen to while i am working out but the rest is good	9
1	other than that this is a proper introduction to the heavster	9
1	this album is absolutely beautiful the full musical sound and talent of calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of iron wine make the perfect match it 's almost unheard of that i love every song on an album but this one makes the cut each song wraps you in a warm trance a coccoon of well being it has a really positive emotional effect on me it creates an ambiance of gentle strength wonderful i really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums	9
0	i received emails about delaying my order three times since it showed that the product was available i did n't understand why i had to wait less than two months to get my order i was so disappointed by the amazon this time ! doing business like that i am not sure how long you will survive	9
1	i love this cd ! everything they sing about is so true to life it 's a great arrangement of songs	9
0	gnr were a very overrated band i found appetite for destruction very dull this atleast has the band 's 3 great songs in november rain civil war and live and let die get this for 3 great songs but stay away from gnrs other crappy songs and albums ! ! they are not metal !	9
1	i 've been listening to satoshi tomiie for a long time and this is definetly one of his best cd 's yet its one of those cd 's that is a must have before a road trip just play it and let it ride from beginning to end it keeps your ears on high alert just waiting for that next track to hit before you know it your at the end but who says you cant just hit repeat and start the ride all over again	9
1	i wo n't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended being that i never heard all of her albums so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin' however for me who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me some of the tracks i love a couple i do n't like at all and the rest i just like my favorite ones are in order eroticaray of lightbeautiful strangerthe power of goodbyedeeper and deeperthe prodution is excellent and i love the vocals if your new to madonna my opinion would be to start here but a true fan can give me lessons	9
0	i ca n't believe the other people giving this high marks i love the wheel but darn if this is n't just terrible there is n't even a single on it i ca n't believe the studio released it thank god i got a promotional copy and did n't have to go buy it in the store the catherine wheel needs to get back together quick	9
1	his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics he has an eclectic mix of love songs we are the world type songs and a few others on this album he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes i loved streetcorner symphony ! it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one ! enjoy this album i sure do	9
0	when i played the first composition on this cd i started thinking that perhaps i had purchased a really stellar cd because the first song was really jumping but after that this cd is disapointing to me there are maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally unmemorable with the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her first cd joyce cooling could have made one good cd but in my opinion there are n't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this cd joyce certainly has potential but she needs to work on her creativity she sound here like an artist still maturing in style	9
0	this album is not very good i am a big fan of life in general at the show and slowly going the way of the buffalo but this sucks i listened to it for about 2 weeks and then it cracked my backpack on a road trip but i did n't care becuase it sucked it was boring and it had no flavor not the mxpx i used to know	9
0	i'm an avid tony yayo fan but this album just did n't cut it maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure i do n't know but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them hopefully his next album will be way better a few songs are good to listen to i would think coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about but so seductive being your first single \? \? come on i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean rating c	9
0	is this the same kool keith that created dr octagon dr dooom and black elvis \? quot spankmaster quot represents a regression of creative energy it sounds like keith decided he wanted to make a record one morning and whimsically threw together some tracks it contains little of the genius of his earlier cds with the exception of a couple songs \( quot jewelry shine quot and quot blackula quot \) this album stinks	9
1	for those of us who thought phil collins was to be lost in the mass pop culture think again that was back in the early 80s when i heard this it is mastery distille	9
0	how can he be such an enormous talent when all he does is copy off of other people \? sorry i just cant see it i dont think he does justice to nolan porter 's if i could only be sure on the first track at all if you want to hear some great music listen to the original ! ! !	9
1	no other compilation of garland 's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm all her original soundtrack performances are here sounding magnificent far superior to thin sounding studio re creations this is the real deal assembled with obvious skill intelligence and dedication to the talented legend in a sense this should be the soundtrack album for that magnificent documentary about her that pbs produced a while back do n't pass this up	9
1	i remember hearing of this band when i was just a lad but i never owned any of their albums and none of my closest friends played this for me so this is a great discovery for me i'm only on my second listen but it 's already obvious to me that this is going to become a favorite it 's from my favorite rock period the early seventies and it 's not only nicely remastered it 's also remixed meaning they went back to the original multi tracks not the stereo master i wish more reissues were done this way	9
0	boston have to be one of the worst bands ever ! ! the singer screams and they made some of the lousiest songs like rock n roll band and the horrible more than a feeling they would not hold a candle to smart bands like metallica who rock ! i just got metallica's 4th lp today get and justice for all by metallica insted	9
0	any group that is so lacking in imagination that it has to steal as unusual and distinctive a song title as boulevard of broken dreams \( a 1934 hit song \) deserves to be ridiculed not rewarded with a grammy i'm just full of original ideas i ca n't decide whether to write a song called wake me up before you go go or grandma got run over by a reindeer or maybe do you know the way to san jose \?	9
0	god i ca n't believe this guy ja rule was never a gangsta in his life he ca n't talk gangsta and stop trying to be like tupac tupac actually was a gangsta your a fake and if he was still alive he would not only not role with you but diss you so badly you 'd wet your pants this guy should be booted out of the game not only his he lying when he talks all this gangsta s as if he went through it his ruining hip hop yeah and ja stop dissing eminem and 50 you know perfectly well that they 'd kill you in a battle anyday ja rule has always been s go listen to real rap	9
1	spice 1 's just different from every other rapper and he 's awesome if you love hardcore rap you 'll love spice 1	9
0	i was so disappointed with this cd at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums scratches and all ! they were so bad i play two of the songs over and over the only two i liked when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song i was wrong i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music a filler \? i would quickly skip to another song only to have to skip many times !	9
0	while i like some of these songs i cannot understand a single word he sings i even heard him interviewed and i did n't understand a word when he sings he spends all the time looking down so you ca n't even lip read i do n't think he has stage presence and i think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who ca n't form words he does n't sing clearly and i just ca n't get into his music completely i think i 'll stick to r b	9
1	a great recording the greatest bass solo ever recorded \( as put by another reviewer \) is certainly a stretch but the album is still magnificent heavy sounds is a title that accurately describes the music buy and enjoy	9
1	the best place to start with the best is at the beginning enya 's the celts \( identical to the original 1980s release simply called enya \) is a beautiful collection of music enya is not an artist where you just get the best of album every cd is a best of in itself	9
1	do i mean the best album or the best singer \? you are correct if you said both ! i saw kristin chenoweth on a pbs show broadway 's best at the pops \( though it was not the first time i had heard her \) and decided to check out the offerings here this is a collection of the kind of music and performances i love she has a great range a precise pitch and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself in an era when singers try to outdo each other re interpreting the composer 's original work not usually with great success she is a blessing	9
0	this is no saw 85 92 as some people compare it to oh no this is a largely unfulfilling listen the tracks all sound too similar i realize richard 's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear but the drum programming and harmonic development is lackluster only track worth burping over is the last one xmd something has he been taking piano lessons since druqks \? for those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch check out nick forte 's new release young man 's disease which is better than anything else i 've heard this year	9
1	excellent songwriting guitar playing and overdubbing another live album following his first with previously recorded songs not on frampton comes alive would have been just as successful as comes alive days dawning crying clown fanfare are a few such songs a few songs from wind of change something's happening and even a couple from his early days with the herd would have contributed to a second successful live album rather than the i'm in you album which was a terrible disappointment	9
1	in august 1969 five session singers were invited to form a new session group main singer was tony burrows of ivy league and flowerpot men fame the first success came with the second single united we stand this cd collects together the three us hits of the session group plus the only us hit of the group that was the face of the session group in concert during 1971 1973 and that would become the second outfit of the group the eurovision winning song save your kisses for me the rest of the songs are a mix of songs from this second outfit 1974 1980 this outfit is still on tour at the end of the centur	9
0	this young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice albeit a little underpowered but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture there is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties in fact i suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short shorts once again sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art	9
0	i like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while i'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax this cd just did n't fit there are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast upbeat or there 's too much talking chanting i found myself distracted when i put this cd on	9
0	\( \) this cd is sub par most of the beats are cool but they 're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics	9
1	i do n't see how they can compare these guys to the mars volta or coheed and cambria i can hear the prog elements but it 's more of a rush kind of prog rock shorter 3 minute songs compared to 12 minute epics they are missing the one thing that would make them a true prog rock band the songs just are n't as epic as a tmv or a c amp c song i think reviewers liken brazil to these other bands because their singer has a high pitched singing voice this is still an amazing album that is well worth your time go into it expecting sparta rather than the mars volta and you wo n't be disappointed	9
1	this is a great collection of hits from the 70 's it is packed with hits it is a great addition to a 70 's hits collection	9
0	one good song of course the sound of silence and the studio version is far better than this one i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect	9
0	apart from the great selection of soundtracks what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing executed with finesse these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited fuller versions like singing in the rain for example throw in the great price and this double disc set is a must have for all lovers of classic movie music	9
0	hey brrrrruuuuuccce ! what 's the deal \? just about every major top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated except yours why can we buy the tracks editions and get glorious hdcd encoded sound but town sounds like it 's coming out an am radio \? ok you did your best but dubya 's back in the white house for the next four years and kerry 's home in his underwear watching the weather channel you should have plenty of time on your hands now get busy ! let 's see some remastering !	9
1	the one song i know is a remake is goodnight my love i know this because i have it on the original 45 issue and the cd version is an inferior remake but the others with which i'm familiar but do n't have original vinyl to compare only memories seem authentic the audio quality is great and certainly superior to some of the cds you find these days which are only re recordings of old vinyl or cassettes	9
0	this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums he is the king of electric blues you can hear all these songs in great format just awsome playing awsome singing its sure no wonder srv and hendrix really loved albert king	9
1	i do n't like this album as much as their earlier stuff i have liked each release less than the previous and this one falls right in line with that trend the opener quot quality revenge quot is one of their best songs hands down though this is a very good cd but the farther from braid we get in time the less i seem to like their music	9
0	it was awful ! the reproduction of the music was grainy scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to	9
1	what a beautiful album ! one of the rare albums that has no fillers or weaker cuts i 'd call it a classic but that makes it sound dusty these songs could come out in 20 years and still sound fresh	9
1	i saw her perform most of these songs on austin city limits i must admit i had n't paid much attention to her since her debut album back when i was playing in country bands much of this material is kinda introspective but hey on the plus side you get great vocals well crafted songs tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who does n't have to pretend she is anything she is n't and these days that is pretty refreshing ! i think i am becoming a fan	9
0	sucks if you like this album you are a poser that means you think cradle of filth is black metal and slipknot is death metal one guy i know that listens to norma jean as i lay dying and unearth called me emo for listening to acid bath how stupid can you be \? you posers need to wise up and listen to real metal such as morbid angel darkthrone amon amarth old sepultura and dissection	9
0	after a very disappointing viewing of harry 's only you concert dvd i got smart and borrowed only you cd from the library i 'd hoped that concert was just one off how sad this cd is no better than that wretched concert slooooooooooooooow from the start to finish and what happened to harry 's voice and phrasing \? god unbearable when harry met sally come by me what happened to you harry	9
0	ok let me preface my comments by justifying the 2 star rating it 's rodney dangerfield he was a class act as for the cd if you 're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone 's cheesy clavinova then this cd is for you i bought this because of the last track rappin' rodney and boy was i disappointed it sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette do yourself a favor get all of rodney 's dvd 's with his standup material and remember him for what he was a comedy legend	9
1	hey there all want to listen to some great songs by a country artist chely wright then go ahead and purchase this cd you will be amazed at the talent chely has songs spanning from her ealier days to her current hits a great collection for the diehard fan and a great gift for those who have not been able to experience the very talented chely wright	9
1	i 've always liked tevin campbell he had a beautiful voice and really did it on break it down i particularly like break it down shhh brown eyed girl among others excellent cd overall	9
1	this cd has tons of power and soothing energy it really shows off how well part understands the human voice	9
1	two of the greatest names in show business at their zenith there are so many good tracks on this set that it 's hard to pick out some over the others a couple of superb standouts are jolson 's swanee and rock a bye although every track is just excellent the sound quality on the set is outstandingly great i hope the people that put this set together will do the same incredible job with other classic recordings by jolson and crosby	9
0	this music is a rip off all is borrowed to the 4 first albums of marc bolan playing under the name of tyranosaurus rex something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy a shame	9
0	blues singers should n't try to go mainstream if they do try and succeed fine that means they 've stayed true to their roots when they try and fail \( as susan has done with hope and desire \) one would hope they 'd try to get back to where they started for me that was just wo n't burn i guess when one is happily married with children it 's hard to sing the blues since you 're not feeling them you 're faking them	9
1	what else can be said about this great cd \? it 's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs child of vision is the best \( the piano solo is killer \) of the best but this is one of those rare cd 's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end \( no skipping over songs you do n't like \) a true classic	9
0	this cd is pretty awful you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd one of the worst songs ever is calling it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground na na na na na na na na i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer	9
1	i like this album its got a nice mix of old and new material along with some live material great to see pe still at it in this ever changing rap game	9
0	it 's a decent album but she seems to copy riffs a bit on this album mother mother definitly rips of stairway to heaven from stairway 's ending vocals riff \( and as we wind on down the road \) does she give zep credit on that \? now that rockstar supernova has used the song twice it has brought mother mother back to life a bit but that riff rip just annoys me good female yell and complain song but i just ca n't get past that riff rip	9
1	the performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful this is the kind of material one can expect from deutsche grammophon wonderful music a wonderful violinist wonderful interpretations and wonderful sound \( not just for its time \) there are also very few squeaks and he is almost always right on pitch ! often called definitive this is the one to get highly recommended	9
1	being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals i must say i rate this as quot one of the best quot the dancers are fantastic ! the music utterly great the choice of dances \( from classical to rock \) is highly deversified can't wait till i get it so i can play it again and again as well as quot rock the house shake my bootie etc quot	9
1	i 've been waiting for this one this disc and this group period was funky movin was one of the baddest instrumental jams that i 've ever heard period can you see the light is a tight jam as well one of the many bad groups from back in the day	9
1	please do yourself a favor and buy this cd ! whatever you do dont listen to it in your car though no kidding aside i almost ran my car off the road because i was laughing so hard	9
1	this ancient jazz classic never sounded better rudy van gelder did an excellent job remastering this one with the 24 bit he proves that it does matter who takes up the task of remastering this wonderful jazz classic just keep them coming rudy	9
1	toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable but there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste my fave song is 'is it for me' it is hard to classify them though it sort of deep and meaningful \( at most times \) pop rock other good tracks include walk on the ocean pray your gods and i will not take etc i regard this album and 'dulcinea' as their two best albums	9
0	holy cow i was ready to rip my hair out after listening to this horrible sophomoric insipid yuk this is like chinese water torture drip drip drip on and on yaaaggghhhh	9
1	ahh this is a great cd i listen to it every day it 's fun music and the lyrics are wonderful hope everybody enjoys it as much as i do	9
0	there are 2 good songs on this disc stinkfist and aenema the rest are pure crap half of the tracks are n't even songs they 're just a bunch of noise no wonder tool wo n't put any of thier music on itunes or napster they want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your 14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap if you gave this cd 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely	9
0	will not run on my computer love the content however i keep my music on my hard drive and was looking forward to working out with this album on my mp3 i will be demanding a refund ! do not buy if you have a mp3 supported car stereo if you plan on playing at your computer it will not work due to ill conceived piracy protection ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	although each track is beautiful in it 's own way it 's their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey and personally like a lay 's potato chip not able to listen to just one yeah i need the whole thing	9
0	i love this band and have all the rest of their cds	9
0	this entire cd hbo special is stolen material all this material was originally written performed by bill hicks buy hicks dvd bill hicks live satirist social critic stand up comedian if you want the material in its true formhttp www amazon com exec obidos tg detail b0004z33fk qid 1130712550 sr 1 1 ref sr 1 1 104 5459925 2315938 \? v glance s dvdbill hicks was also paid tribute on tool 's aenima album	9
0	having listened to steven 's previous albums greetings from michigan and seven swans countless times i cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album stevens blatantly rips off his own music i consider michigan to be sufjan 's masterpiece do yourself a favor and start there	9
1	this is one of the most beautiful restorative collections of celtic music i have ever heard haunting sublime harp cello guitar flute and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation prayer or simply unwinding the mind and emotions the poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself highly recommended	9
0	the cat carol is the most depressing christmas song i have ever heard not to ruin the ending for you but the cat dies ! did n't exactly put me in the holiday spirit	9
0	people this is easy listening at it 's easiest every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years that is if it is n't allready i do n't know anything about what they have done in the past except for a song i remember being played on the radio a few years ago must have been on the album prior to this but that song sounds just like two tracks on this one not only that but if there was n't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests i could n't really tell any of them apart horrible music with no feeling or soul not even creative do n't waste your time with this	9
1	as a collector of musical scores i thoroughly enjoyed this selection it is rated as one of my favorites but i must warn that if you do not like instramental style music then this is n't for you but if you are then this is a must	9
1	so incubus rocks no matter who you are or which of their albums is your favorite plainly put this album was not my favorite of theirs it 's good it 's really good but if you 're expecting incubus good you 'll be slightly disappointed	9
0	i think someone forgot to tell molotov that rap metal rock rap was dead had potential but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me	9
0	i bought the cd because i thought it was instrumental music then i hit the tracks with vocals yikes ! this is the only cd of lee ritenour that i bought i am a first time listener i must say that i do like the instrumental music very much however i really hate the tracks with vocals	9
1	the guitars are n't loud enough and neither is the bass for that matter which is so true but it 's still a great album seeing them live makes up for this cd no doubt stand out songs the city sleeps in flames the world as we know it just a taste my darkest hour empty glasses the only medicine'my darkest hour' 'empty glasses' are my favorites i know those songs by heart	9
1	all i want to know is when is the next album going to be released \? i ca n't wait ! this album is fantastic	9
1	i recommend this cd to anyone stuck in a rut like i was listening to the same artists over and over but wanting something new and fresh life on planet groove will be a welcome addition to your collection great for the drive	9
1	i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try i am happy with all of the tracks some tracks remind me of beatles a little but not all so the band does have a unique sound even though from the 90s the sound is like many bands making it today i like it	9
1	sounding thing occurred when ex springfield messina melded with loggins and it was large ! c s n amp y strove to be this good every time they released a tune this compilation not only displays the music crafting abilities of these two in conjunction but also showcases their power to deliver dynamic live performances dedicated to todd j	9
0	i agree with the other negative review below uninspired simply forgettable radio trash cliched lyrics \? check muddy simple riffs \? check boring drumming with a couple of poorly played double bass kicks \? check thank god i got this in a box of cd 's from a dj buddy of mine for free awhile back if i actually paid for this crap i 'd have to kill myself judging from all the positive reviews however it seems some people at lava records or possibly the band themselves \( if they 're still around i hope not \) have been trying to plug this sorry excuse for music	9
0	i ordered the dvd of damn yankees to watch on tv for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day i ordered it i paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the cd of only music ! i do n't think i will order from amazon again it was my first time and probably my last liz snyde	9
0	some of the songs here are good most notably never be forgotten beautiful i heard this song on the radio and i thought it was faith hill or martina mcbride singing herein lies the problem the song is good the voice is good but if she sounds like faith or martina there 's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there add to this that this is mostly bubble gum pop and not country there 's really nothing that stands out here why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there \? that 's the question	9
1	this is truly one of the great jazz albums of all time surprisingly evans' introspective style and cannonball 's soulful approach meld together perfectly perhaps this is testament to just how hugely talented these men are both the technical skill and pure musicmanship displayed on this record is just amazing i 've owned this cd for over 10 years now and still find so much to listen to in these recordings highlights are the amazing quot waltz for debby quot and earl zindars' waltz quot elsa quot easily one of the most beautiful songs ever written in my opinion you simply cannot go wrong with this cd	9
0	hey folks this is brilliant and all like the articles say but what they do n't mention is that it 's impossible to listen to there are no verses choruses or even beats to speak of there are no songs it 's just a sound collage or something from start to finish the booklet prints lyrics but i could n't find 'em this music is too brilliant for its own good and you can forget about using it as party or background music jdub 's other offerings are much better	9
1	the sundays come out with a cd once a decade thus putting me in constant cravings for new material though camera obscura is very original and very much their own band they satisfy the cravings that only harriet wheeler could touch truly vast and intimate at the same time and a voice that speaks to something very deep sad and lovely inside you	9
0	not the type of music i had envisioned much slower than i was hoping for	9
0	this cd is awesome from beginning to end i really enjoy listening to this type of music this cd is a must have	9
1	sombre romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre it is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting its not what you would really consider to be a religious album but there are many undertones that help get the message across this point being made very clear in museum of iscariot which talks of jesus from judas' point of view rowan 's vocal stylings change to meet the moods of every song on this album from low opera type to screaming in a superb way that stays consistent and never gets old if you are into relaxed darkwave goth music this is a perfect album to purchase	9
0	this cd is without a doubt amazing stars are lost because prior to recording you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig his tone is crushing sounds perfect but the second he stops playing every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll it 's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once because it is a chronic problem in every song	9
0	this album is n't not very good at all there are about four songs i like first off the production on this cd is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats then the guest artists do a sub par job lyrically then there are no new verses from biggie on the album they should have stopped with born again because album will be a forgotten one not a great way to close out the legecy of bigge smalls	9
0	jeff buckley sounds like what marc bolan would have sounded like if bolan had taken perry como as his musical muse seriously think about marc bolan trying to sound like a '50 's crooner and you 'll know what jeff buckley sounds like	9
0	when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove there was no better sounding group than qms cipollina 's talent was awe inspiring unfortunately one of quicksilver 's overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina 's departure without cipollina qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group despite the talents of duncan freiberg and elmore i saw them at the hollywood palladium 33 years ago and can verify this if you want to hear them at their best buy the 1st album happy trails or lost gold and silver	9
0	as a huge counting crows fan i thought it was kinda cool when i came across a tribute album to them right up until the time that i listened to the cd it is nearly impossible to get through the best way i can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke i rated it one star because there 's no 0 star option if you have any intentions of buying this cd find a website where you can preview it first and thank me later	9
0	actually garth hudson the former organist of the band does not play on this cd \( nor 'every geriatric rockstar 's' \) the musician you might be referring to is al garth ex of loggins messina	9
1	marias and srayle if you like the guaraldi original then keep it and chuck the winston personally i think the winston performance is refreshing and a delightful 'twist' on guaraldi 's works the piano is brillaint sounding and at volume thru a good system sounds like there 's a piano in the room it should be emphatically understood you are buying winston in this case and not guaraldi i have both versions	9

0	man can she get anymore stupid and talentless she needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits all the songs on this album are totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power vocal range and versatility jennifer lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today she gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career just because your a great actor actress does n't necessarily mean you can sing too some actors actresses were able to achieve it but not jennifer lopez she needs to quit the music business while she still can please stick to acting oh wait ! i forgot she ca n't do that either !	9
1	jodeci 's forever my lady has a problem that most nineties r b releases had at that time if the fast songs were tight then the slow songs suck and vice versa jodeci 's first cd had some of the finest slow songs to come off of one cd in 1991 stay forever my lady come talk to me u i and i'm still waiting rank with the best but every single fast is hot trash	9
0	some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un inititiated i am writing to confirm that assertion i have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here but what a disappointment this album was for me it sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door my advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down jack 's appreciation of the blues is admirable but only realised on the song i fought piranhas tellingly this is the final song on the album otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times	9
1	when this album first came out i felt jilted but i recently had an oppertunity to listen to it for what it is and i think its a great album make no mistake if you 're a die hard 80 's rocker you 'll hate this album the production is raw and the songwriting is lean and mean as opposed to elaberate and detailed but that does n't mean that the musicianship is lacking on this record if you can keep an open mind i think this ablum is one that you 'll love	9
1	evan dando has once again delivered an astounding collection of pop punk songs this album rocks like lovey and is almost as catchy as come on feel i 've been listening to this album for weeks on end	9

0	aerosmith were one of the worst most annoying bands of all time they only made 3 decent songs in same old song and dance seasons of wither and janies got a gun rest of the songs just stink explosively avoid most albums from this hugely overrated band steven tyler screams he ca n't sing at all \? \? \? this is music for drug addicts	9
0	quot modern quot usually sounds like some outdated mid 80s new wave album by the cars flock of seagulls or somesuch it is not a punk record mostly midtempo pop the three songs diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful shelley 's are considerably better the usual wry lyrics and great hooks i would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch buzzcocks stuff newbies should buy quot operator 's manual quot or quot going steady quot or dig up the amazing quot different kind of tension quot from a used record store somewhere ! also see them live if you have a chance	9
1	anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life \? right before he enters the bus i would love to listen to it again but i ca n't find it anywhere	9
0	this cd was devoid of any of govi 's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work frankly it was just a bunch of new age background noise that one would hear on elevators some of the craig chaquico style stuff was interesting but better left to craig try 7th heaven mosaico or guitar odyssey instead	9
0	this album is dull and without any emotion the only reason this guy is even known is because of his backgroud	9
0	yeah i am a big fan of moby and accidentally buying the cd that almost ended his career does n't shake that if you want some good moby might i suggest 18 or play this has some quiet more ambient tracks which show some promise but fail to build up to anything everything else is moby screaming in a traditional punk style which were almost humorous except not this much money humorous i am not a fan of this cd i know he was starting out in a punk band but his other stuff is much bette	9
0	i saw the movie and liked the songs in it i ordered the soundtrack from the movie but it was not the soundtrack they have a dubbed another person in on ike 's part all the songs from the movie were not on the soundtrack and some other of tina 's were included i feel that if it is going to be advertised as a soundtrack then it should be a true soundtrack i was disappointed	9
0	i cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub par testament release testament must have taken hints from metallica and tried to attract a different audience this is not a horrible album but compared to any other testament album it is easily their worst only the die hard testament fan or those into commercial metal should pick this up	9
0	this was just to much country for this parrothead i liked one song piece of work and that was about it	9
1	bireli is not only one of the best living guitar players in gypsy jazz he is also one of the most creative on this album he gives us a new take on django 's music that is simply stunning move has a smaller more focused sound that it 's predecessors and the addition of the saxophone brings a really fresh twist to this great old music bireli is one of the hottest jazzmen around this disc is all the evidence you 'll need to draw the same conclusion bravo !	9

0	i would n't recommend this table some of the plastic slats that unroll to form the table top have already broken and i 've only used this table on three camping trips too bad because most of my other coleman gear has held up really well	10
1	i started taking tennis classes at my community college a couple weeks ago i picked up this racquet because it was cheap and light with a big head it has performed very well and my game is good enough to play with some of the more experienced players that have 200 racquets	10

0	the day we received the stroller we were very excited we put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction however when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming we have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company i would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time	10
0	you cannot sit upright in this chair bad for soccer games \( why we bought it \) the chair is designed to lean back the company is not amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth unless you plan to sleep in this chair it stinks	10
1	these bands were recommended by our son 's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them but they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked before using these bands his legs and arms were covered with bites we are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others	10
0	the first time i used these push up bars the flimsy plastic they 're made out of cracked in three different places perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely but i'm not going to risk an injury finding out in the trash they go i suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing	10
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	10
0	i was so happy to order this it has n't even been put together yet in box for two weeks they sent the wrong hardware with it i emailed them 2 times and got no response after twenty minutes of trying i finally got a human voice she was nice and shipped the parts they arrived today and guess what \? the same wrong parts again i ca n't get a response so i guess i will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together at least i have a list from the owner 's manual overall experience was a big fat bust	10

1	this product is wonderful ! it sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music we received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2 5 years old and still loves it we keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear	10
1	i bought this stroller after much research and deliberation it is comfortable for my as well as my daughter it handles wonderfully it folds pretty well too the front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature i am tall and it helps to have the handle where i need it i have used this for both walking shopping and jogging and think it is perfect ! from purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days i am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase i love this stroller !	10
0	this product falls into the category of not worth the cost of shipping for me the bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat the bag was shipped in an envelope via usps first class mail for 1 35 samfe was the retailer that amazon used for this transaction so free super saver shipping was not available samfe charged 7 50 for shipping i generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits hence the low star rating for an otherwise adequate product	10
0	expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail refused package a month ago exorbitant charge made to my credit card and i will have to seek resolution with them since amazon takes no responsibility vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel refund order amazon places orders with sketchy vendors like this and then you're stuck with erroneous charges beware ! !	10
1	this is a real good ramp i just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air ! overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major it is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time they are fun and you will have hours of fun ! ! ! \) \)	10

0	our kids loved this so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on off button \( making the toy unusable \) i bought another one would n't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later \? this toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion the manufacturer needs to correct this problem	10

0	this bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing i used it for less than five mintues and broke it has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks the company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too the barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and i ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken i spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit anyone honestly that tells you differently is wrong	10
0	i bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out ! very dissatisfied socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place i much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other i would not recommend these for anyone	10
1	i love these workouts they are very intense and the results are almost immediate however this series is not for beginners the best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day my only complaints with this series were the lack of attention billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves all in all this was a great purchase for me i will probably purchase the new bootcamp elite series	10
1	it was just what i wanted a relatively stress free low impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv takes about 30 minutes to put together it 's quiet stowable and fun my ten year old likes it too i do n't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as i'm wearing shoes so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue had n't been wearing shoes a really nice little machine and what a great price	10

1	i bought these clear color version as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer according to the gift recipient they 're excellent they really do n't leak or fog up he was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that did n't get any water in his eyes \( but please note he does n't swim for more than one half hour at a time so i ca n't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity \) he also said that the fit is very good and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types for the price these are an excellent bargain	10
1	great product i just received my ball today i could n't wait to work out if i learn how to stay on it that would be saying something ! i will always recommend max fitness	10

1	i just ordered this beauty the price is right the price will probably be more expensive in a few months the full tang is very sturdy the handle is usually a lil thin \( flat \) on these type of blades i was also looking at the galaxy viper twin blades in silver \( also comes in black \) but there 's no pic of the shealth it just says it 's nylon shealth it holds the 2 blades this was n't exactly what i was looking for so i chose the ronin btw i got the last 1 from a seller they were out of stock last time i checked	10

1	i just switched from a suunto t6 to a t4 and this pc pod works seemless between the watch and pc it is about 2x a paper clip and with the usb connection it is easy to carry although a little pricy from the competition if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the t4 foot pod and pc pod work very well down side is the software which does not support mac come on suunto	10

0	i purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months the resistence motor is defective which is what i have had replaced 3 times now this motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus the positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus ovewrall i cannot recommend this product	10
0	the gun broke about 7 days after my son received it and the people would not take it back said he 'd had it too long i will never buy this product nor work with this seller again horrible	10
0	i did n't like these at all the toes are too pointy and would n't fit might be ok for younger children than stated	10
0	overall the item works well if keeping track of one player it is just fine when trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player to play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two	10
1	this watch heart rate monitor is everything i wanted i can get a heart rate in about 5 seconds by putting your index and middle finger on the two buttons on the top and bottom of the clock face i havent used the other features yet but appreciate not wearing a strap hrm anymore	10
1	i have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best the thickness \( 1 8 inch \) is just perfect not too thick so it 's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning what i really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip in a word it is comfortable	10
1	i bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them ! inexpensive but not easy to find i was told easy to use my dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on christmas morning	10

0	the first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit the seller forwarded the photos and complaint to texsport and they sent us another top when we put that top on we found the same thing that is when we found the frame was 4 longer than the top there were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner after cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together when next spring comes we will replace this one and i can assure you it will not be a texsport product	10

1	recently we had a chance to use a bongo board about 40 years old it was all wood with quite a large drum the one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons it is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity the drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost and balance is frequently lost finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them great investment for year round fun	10
0	well first of all i ordered this product on amazon and they sent me something completely different they sent me roller skates with the wheels side by side instead of the roller blades i ask for like in the picture then when i sent an e mail trying to exchange the product no one returns my calls or e mails me back after so long of trying it 's already past the 30 day exchange policy so yeah if you want a better review contact me so i can exchange the product	10

0	this fitness mat is thick and cushy but i find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it 's about a foot too short my biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover \( a major reason i selected this product \) shrank to a completely unusable size when i washed it \( in cold water line dried \) now i'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable	10
1	i 'd do business with these guys again the shipment made it on time and was just as i expected the only reason they got a four star was because one of the poker chip trays was damaged when i opened the box	10

0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it so i thought i might like the alps chair too i was wrong it 's very light weight but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs which made it more difficult to carry and transport the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings one of which broke the first time i used the chair the next day three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless save your money on this one	10

1	i 've been shot by many other airsoft guns but this one really packs a punch my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic the automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead it will scare you that you broke it but no it 's just the dead battery the metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast this gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble but be patient it 's actually easier than it looks i highly recommend this gun	10

0	i returned this item as it did n't fit my 19 pound boston terrier well at all it was way too large for his body small obviously means small for a larger dog instead just be aware !	10
0	this product never worked buttons were defective it would n't stay on it would n't calibrate the seller sky box usa would n't exchange or refund because i was outside of the 30 day window \( this was a christmas present and a very disappointing one at that \) you 'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a casio watch	10

1	i am so glad i finally found an online source for these visors i 've been picking them up one or two at a time from street fairs for probably 20 years now you can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos because they are so light and comfortable and they keep the sun out of your eyes \( or the rain \) and these particular visors here on amazon had good snaps too	10
0	i bought this ear plugs are uncomfortable my ears hurt and in the first use just fall down i just prefered the ones who are made of pvc are better	10
1	i have had problems with exercise bands that break fairly easily although i have not had this one long it has shown no type of wear and i use it every day ! i would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to add resistance to their workout	10
1	this spring is of industrial strength it can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs better than any made available at your local hardware store it 's only about 4 in long so it does not take up much space however if your ceiling beams are not structurally sound no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag	10
1	if you are looking for a tank that is cheap but not a piece of well look no further this is the best tank ever i own 3 of them myself andc wouldnt buy anything other than them	10

0	unfortunately this product did not live up to our expectations it did not last one full season the bottom braces not reinforced very well	10
0	initially a very good buy however after only 3 days of very light use i had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk and i was in another room for the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case	10
0	the present model is not the newest available and it has the disadvantage of hurting the nose by prolonged use the newest presentation has solved this problem	10
1	mine is blackened scratched dented and i do n't even carry the insides any more but i love it this is usually the only cooking pot i carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water the wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow i think it 's part bucket this is the one	10

0	i got this item to give a a gift i got it fast however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken it was n't worth returning it because if you 've opened it you can only get a 50 refund and have to pay shipping which would have cost more than what i would have been refunded do n't bother with this one	10
0	if you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat seemed to fill the room with it 's funk does not grip well i bought it for grip yes it 's stable worth it \? not to me try the hugger mugger earth elements mat \( 5mm model \) it 's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat not as stable in place but seems a better value \( reasonable price \) and it 's biodegradable	10
0	your money could be well spent on something other than this not any better than a regular pair of gloves you can buy at wal mart	10
0	i consider my dogs to be small they are all around 25 pounds i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big i think that for a small backpack that they are just too large thank you	10
0	both me and the mat slide all over the place it has no traction whatsoever and is absolutely not suitable for anyone who does yoga on a regular basis	10
1	we bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday he loves it ! his older brother \( 3 1 2 \) has the regular razor scooter but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself this kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother good for the younger kids but it does not go as fast as the regular razor as a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two definetly worth the money though he just loves it !	10
1	my three sons and i saw these pogos demonstrated at the cleveland x games a couple years ago we could not beleive what we saw this is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen for the money it 's a tremendous value and their customer service is the best i have come across they also make a high \( er \) octane version called the flybar 1200 which supports larger riders for adults \( yes adults will love this thing ! \) or kids this is a must have this christmas my youngest son ca n't wait for their next model \( flybar 400 \) due in '07 i believe an absolute 100 thumbs up ! jim woods akron ohi	10
0	i trained for a marathon and several 10k races using a heart rate monitor they are very good instruments for training and i recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape after you 've purchased one or two of them you become a better shopper i purchased an f 4 for a friend and i was very very disappointed in the battery life when i found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out some of the newer heart monitors nikon for one have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years	10
0	it only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs does n't run well over pine needles or leaves \( make sure to rake the yard before riding ! \) the acceleration in slow the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens i spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing it stops when the child tries to make a tight turn all of this was on the grass it was advertised as being rugged off road capable when in fact it only works on the paved driveway do n't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person it 's been 3 days and still have n't heard !	10
1	there were a few minor imperfections but i'm overall happy with this sword the attention to detail and replication of cloud 's weapon are commendable	10
1	i bought these skates as a christmas present for my daughter and she skated around the house all morning for me this was a good buy	10
1	highly recommended ! ! ! ! my wife uses this pack for nursing school as you can imagine she carries a lot of stuff this pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps i would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school	10
1	i ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them she was n't really used to skating either but has done very well on them not too many falls and learned easily great item even for beginners ! ! ! kim collin	10

0	i was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat i got neither it is pretty but that is about it	10
1	difficult to put together with just one person though not impossible seems better for a child under 3 feet tall though my daughter and i are making do she loves it	10
1	do n't listen to the uneducated reviews here these are great for hitting the heavy bag speed bags focus mitts etc the length of these 108 makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves the 170 180 are for sparring and competitive bouts that is why ringside makes different lengths there is also a 120 length which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps	10
0	i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift at first he was thrilled to get a new one upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain making it almost impossible \( and very uncomfortable \) to use he had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way he did however like the other features namely the light and the pen	10
1	i 've had one of these for 13 years one for thirteen years it still works great please use it carefully if you 're going to use it you can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure \( or not \) repetitive stress syndrome to completely avoid that and any similar problems you 'll need dr sonnon but in the meantime just be careful	10
1	its a good sword i put it through my room door no prob	10
1	i am not an exercise person but i need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they should n't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints this machine is perfect for all of us i put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy the electronics on it are working just fine it 's the kind of exercise machine that i can get on watch tv and forget i'm actually exercising	10
0	i ordered the igloo quick and cool 150 from target i had it 2 days after ordering it was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used back it went be careful ordering from target in january they have to do something with those christmas returns check out the product carefully	10
1	and so does gadget dad and gadget kids not only is it an affordable piece of equipment but it 's great for the whole family having twin boys age 13 and a husband and i who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives this does just that ! i 'll admit i was a bit upset when i found that gadget dad had ordered it because i was the normal skeptic but it 's been well worth the investment and then some	10
0	bought this for my son he loved it and played with it a lot for about a week then the wheels broke he was n't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway the wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	10
0	i recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall it crashed down the cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless a waste of over three hundred dollars	10
1	i purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it does n't reset i like the fact that i can open the lid and read the led without taking it off my only problem is the little leash it came with both a plastic and a metal clip the plastic clip has lost it 's springiness and i'm sure will stop working soon but at least i have the metal clip to fall back on	10
1	for the price not a bad piece of home gym equipment cushion could be softer but overall it works the back abs real good	10
0	this front fender worked well for a few days until the attachment mechanism thing snapped when i went over a medium sized rock	10
1	i like this whistle 's slim design i wear it when shopping in rough areas if i am apprehended i intend to use the whistle to draw attention to me and the assailant this whistle is much louder than my voice and carries well across other sounds	10
1	it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it	10
1	i bought this bike for my son for christmas and he loves it ! no problems with it so far it is built well and the price was awesome	10
1	it was a gift for my niece she loves it she 's only 7	10
0	hydrolized gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend do a search on that and you 'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones mmmmm does n't that sound good \? what 's more this gelatin protein is incomplete so it does n't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles it may taste ok but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them or just eat jello if you really want gelatin avoid ones with collagen too same issue	10
1	i think that the sword itself is great the casing is cool and the mounting wood is nice the only things i did n't like was that the keychain greiver fell off once i took it out of the box i also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade otherwise i think that i got an amazing deal	10
1	i got this for my daughter awhile ago but due to no snow i had to wait to actually see if it worked well it did ! nicely made and durable daughter loved it	10
0	and bike was stolen less than one month after delivery i have half the cable now good price and attractive product for a low security environment	10

1	good quality well made hat with offical mlb sticker under brim well worth 4 99	10
0	i also bought this because it was the consumer reports best buy and i expected to get a lot of use out of it the frame broke on my first \( i weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week \) after about 1100 miles and its replacement just died after only 350 miles so far i 've paid about a dollar a mile i 'll never buy from schwinn again	10
0	the snap on the leapers elite drop leg holster \( the term elite must be used loosely \) would never stay attached it would always either unsnap or come loose at the back eventually it fell off in the field and i lost it the straps would never stay securely in the place i positioned them the leapers deluxe drop leg holster is much more effective even w one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place the method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well spend a few more dollars for the deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the elite	10
0	rec 'd this pitchback and assembled the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults very disappointed	10
1	i was happy with my purchase i recieved my bearings within 6 business days the bearings were in great condition	10
1	sword looks awesome ! very heavy and cool blade is strong but not sharp for collector purposes handle and point where blade connects to hilt is very shaky but can be fixed quickly overall sword and scabbard are very realistic and cool looking	10
1	this product is excellent ! very sturdy durable and the videos are challenging but doable from beginner to advanced you will get the results you 're after i highly recommend this product	10
1	i like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown \( the kid not me \) i could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins as for age requirements the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age i say that 's about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her him how to fall correctly ie not on unpadded body parts like your hands and red works for boys and girls so if you 're thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it 's double the price stick with this	10
0	i brought this pedometers for my church s walking program and we are not happy with them my pedometer keeps falling off with a leach also the biggest thing is that it keeps restting to zero if i had to buy over again i would not buy this pedometer	10
1	i am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet but my carpeting did not have enough padding so i decided to order an exercise mat i a very please with my order i noticed the difference right away the cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome	10
0	i bought these skates last year with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them when i tried to take the wheels off they would n't budge ! spend the extra 50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years when the indoor wheels on these die the skates die too these most definitely are not roller derby skates since those girls change their wheels all the time !	10
0	three days after i put this on my keyring the two parts of the highgear smartlatch broke apart and i could n't put them back together then a week later the compass popped out of the case it 's now in my tool drawer perhaps only mine was this fragile	10
1	this rack works perfect for me it as easy to assemble and its easy to use it folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use my bikes have curved cross bars so this mounting style was my only option and it works great	10
1	i just bought the speedbelt 2 deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me so far the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5 10 mile run range it fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle for longer runs i 'd suggest the 4 bottle belt but this one is great for the intermediate range the belt fits comfortably and i did n't feel that it bounced around much at all recommended	10
1	i looked at many different variations of swiss army knife before i decided on this one i could n't be happier ! this has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs \( the screwdriver heads the small blade the scissors \) and it 's great for outdoor use at picnics camping or canoeing \( the saw blade the large knife the toothpick \) there are still a few tools i have n't used but overall this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money	10
1	purchased this tricycle for my grandson 3rd birthday a huge success ! ! ! ! not only was it reasonably priced it came w free shipping great deal	10
0	i bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking but after i say 2 3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars at a critical point i did carry a heavy backpack in the basket but still i think the basket is a piece of junk plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork which limits your height of your handlebars the basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable i ca n't recommend this basket buy a basket from your local sports authority or something thanksdarealdeal	10
0	first of all it took like 2 weeks for then gun to get to me 2 weeks later the piston broke so its not a high quality airsoft gun but it looks cool and its worth the price	10
1	except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen shorten the strap again does exactly what it is supposed to do and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability great for spotting oneself too i would buy it again tho i do n't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe so if you can burn the 35 or so get it with no fear otherwise use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout	10
0	i ordered the pogo roo pogo stick on dec 6 2006 and i am still waiting for it to be shipped they just bumped it back another month to mid may for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months ! very poor service	10
0	this was given to me as a gift i used it almost every day for about 1 1 2 months then a cable on it broke it never even worked that well to begin with i e mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty they told me they had to order it from china and had no idea when it would come they gave no apologies they could not have cared less eight months later after i had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me ! ! ! ! ! i used it for 1 month the whole year ! ! how lame	10
0	this tablecloth bleeds as soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms ! i ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect ! go figure ! avoid these	10
0	graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product this rack will scrape the paint right off your bike the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords ratchet tie downs etc this was a complete and total waste of money and damaged my bike on top of all that it is not an inexpensive rack ! save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack	10
1	this gun was great when i got it i immediatly pulled it out and went to play with it good for kids just starting out with bb guns also it is n't that powerful overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is 0 0	10
1	this was a present on our girls 3rd birthday she rode off an on from 2 until 9 she loved it so much we could n't wait for the battery to run out for the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car quick to learn how to drive it loud \? \? a little bit but hey it 's a kids toy if they did n't make noise the kids would n't like it great toy ! ! great value !	10
0	small very small kit not as advertised every item needs expensive batteries	10
1	the plastic side mounts \( 4 \) appear to be solid and not flimsy i replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones \( you know since this is going on a boat ! \) but at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless the package says includes all stainless mounting fasteners so i guess that means hooks only the supplied screws are not even galvanized so if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat go get stainless screws that are also 1 2 longer than the ones provided all in all it 's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get	10
1	just the perfect cap ! it fits like no other swimming cap it wo n't pull you hair when removing it neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning very resistant material and a great finish awesome colors !	10

0	i purchased 5 of these for christmas presents i tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time number 1 this was dead in the box so were numbers 2 3 and 4 i did n't bother with number 5 every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested speaking of instructions they tell you to make certain the light is off before attempting to charge there is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is real junk says hummer made in china and all five are going back	10
0	description of bike was misleading weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds although i weigh slightly less than this i am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart i would not have purchased the bike had i seen this limit in the description also the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated i thought i was purchasing a simple exercise bike not such a complicated piece of machinery this bike would be perfect for a younger more athletic slimmer person	10
0	i bought this item based on other people 's reviews i'm sad to say they were wrong maybe it 's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box the gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as i started firing it it sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go my recommendation well just look at my title	10
1	i bought my son and daughter a pair of these shoes for christmas i have a hard time getting them to wear regular shoes anymore they love to wear them everywhere they go great way to get the kids physically active !	10
0	i ordered 2 of these flimsy tables they were not only expensive to ship but one arrived damaged the one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully meaning that people 's drinks would slide off the table these are the most flimsy tables i have ever encountered if it were n't for the replacement tables i found at costco the party i planned would have been a disaster	10
0	i bought the cycleops wind indoor trainer to train at home when i ca n't hit the road because of work \( or weather \) complications if you are like me that means weekdays late at night or very early in the morning i'm terribly frustrated because i ca n't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes my neighbors ca n't stand it hey i ca n't stand it ! the noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner to give you an idea i do n't even hear the music from my ipod while riding this thing do n't buy it ! go for the magnetic resistance models	10
0	i thought from the reviews this would be fairly sturdy rope it was n't it was pretty limp for the price i suppose i got what i paid for	10
0	if you study pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions one of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still as a lover of pilates and how much it has done for me i urge you to buy something else	10
0	i was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good when it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy 's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2 4 people i kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch the pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox	10
0	the accessories that come along with this nice are great albeit somewhat impractical \( who 's going to use a slingshot anyway \? \) but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality but this handle has a cheap brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage it 's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress which makes this blade a dangerous one to use do not buy this knife or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle	10
1	i got a pair of these boots for christmas and even though i'm not sure what all they can be used for they are great ! the construction is top notch they 're easy to use comfortable etc i seen cheaper boots on the market but when i'm buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete tile floor in my house i want the best product for the job	10
1	my daughter love these skates so much that she did not want to take them off	10
1	great mat provides good purchase even when getting sweaty it is a bit short if you are above 6ft \( like me \) to do ashtanga but is great for hatha yoga	10
0	i was extremely disappointed in this item i think it is a good concept but it does n't work well at all it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it i tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that i drank anything it is awkward to drink from too i can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market not worth buying just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation	10
1	this is a wonderful gym it is similar to the boflex but without the high pricetag delivery was very fast i am very satisfied !	10
0	scary looking but inpractical the wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already \( if your fists are that big you do n't need claws \) the talon shaped blades are sharp but ca n't dig in they can only scratch they even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard nice wall decor but nothing more	10
0	placed the order on 11 20 delivery was supposed to be by 12 9 on about 12 1 i contacted the company that amazon said was the provider unbeatable sale inc to verify that they did have the order unbeatable said that it was an amazon order period and gave me a number at amazon to contact amazon said that unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at walmart	10
0	as the previous reviewer said i can see this being passable as a one player score keeper but do n't make a mistake it 's impossible to correct if it is possible i do n't know how as there are no directions using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical with the buttons the way they are its going to get bumped and errors made and you probably wo n't even know it just a horrible design and a waste of money	10
1	great condition made a perfect gift for a friend collecting nfl footballs and the dolphins are my team ! ! \( she wo n't forget her gave her this one ! \) quick service great packaging	10

1	i bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in colorado i recently went in january and it worked nearly perfect ! every location i could find an elevation marker the watch was within 10 feet the thermometer works well also it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly the watch looks great i wear it to work nearly every day i would highly recommend it	10
1	after reviewing some of the other devices to hold the ipod mini in place while exercising selected the armband carrier it more than adequately fills the bill of what i was looking for occassionally you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm but it holds the ipod firmly in place it can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device if you sweat a great deal while you exercise i would advise removing the ipod from the holder after you complete your routine would recommend it to anyone who asks	10
0	i can do this without the system it 's simple why do n't you get a pair of 20 pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups trust me it works i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying anything	10
1	this sword is awesome i thought it would be cheap metal because of the price but it is even better than some of the other swords i bought for more money	10
0	other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason over 65 of the decks are marked and unusable that means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be ok for poker play \( unless you 're lucky \) i have purchase casino used cards before and honestly they are not worth the trouble	10
0	advertised as having a coaster brake not advertised as having a 6 speed not has a 5 speed if i would have known this i would have opted for something else	10
0	i ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two after applying one vial it seemed even worse than before \( tread catches as i walk \) so i applied the second vial just to make it usuable \( still not great \) this stuff is overpriced and either they do n't give you enough or it 's poor quality	10
0	i 'll be returning right away suction cup does not hold at all completely useless	10
1	we bought this for our 8 year old son for christmas he absolutely loves it ! it goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride brakes work very well riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius given the chopper style long nose quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall i suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety easy to put together a no brainer well worth the cost he told us he loves feeling the wind in his face shirt sleeves flapping i think we have started something i may not want to deal with as he gets older future harley riders look out !	10
1	this is the same toy i was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle the women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store awesome toy for infants since it 's light easy to grip and easy to bit my son loved this toy for 2 3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys	10
1	it looks like a cartoon snail and it makes a racket when you squeeze it i 'd say it lives up to everything it aspires to be	10
0	this is a 22 tee ball \? maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place since these should cost about 2 at your local sporting goods store maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package \( but it does n't say that clearly on the page \) bottom line is do n't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue	10
0	i ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations but i expected it to project sound at least a short distance when we tried it out all we got was feedback words were not audible at all when i contacted the seller i was told it was a novelty item only which i think is a ridiculous answer since even a novelty item should work a little maybe the one we got was broken i did n't try again since the seller did n't seem to think anything was wrong with it when i called and the shipping which was not refunded when i returned it was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end	10
0	while i like the functions this offers the screen is a bit hard to read when riding also the instructions are n't very easy to follow for example it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions do n't say how to convert to miles hour i would probably not buy this again	10
0	i purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine unfortunetly the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical i would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment	10

1	i 've had my 1 quart stanley thermos for over 20 years now and this is by far no doubt about it the best thermos ever invented i have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate ny after leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in 20 degree temperatures all day at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot if you need to keep liquids hot this is the best non electric product out there for doing it	10
0	three of these broke granted the company sent me two replacements for nothing after the first one failed but to no avail my wife received something similar from spri \( doctor 's tubing \) and it has lasted for a few years now	10
0	well the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good i dry shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen ! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank ! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games 1 5 out of 5	10
1	this little trike is wonderful ! ! ! my 2 1 2 year old loves it as does our 5 year old neighbor the ride is smooth and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers without the high risk of tipping over i looked for a trike for many hours days and am so happy with this choice	10
1	i had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses the hugger mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it does n't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip	10
0	i bought this over the yakima equivalent for the locking accessory what a mistake i made the racketing system that locks the arm down over the bike is made of plastic and doesnt work i called thule to complain and was told i have a faulty unit and i need to rma it i sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case but i would steer clear if i was you	10
1	i bought this toning ball so my girlfriend and i could work out together it 's a little heavier than i 'd recommend for small women but boy do you feel it when you 're done !	10
1	i am very happy with my choice it is just the right size nicely finished with glossy black paint installs in a minute usage is very convenient it has that perfect click into place property you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the stand position to hide it when you are ready to go just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame it does the job perfectly and it feels great	10
1	my 9 month old loves this toy before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls he would roll it on the floor and crawl after it it keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it also there are no loose parts or pieces to lose which i appreciate great toy	10
1	i just wanted to comment on sarah 's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together my son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help i agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated i took it in parts after reading it fully twice after all the small parts pole height adjustment apparatus rim backboard i carried it all outside and put it togehter one picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard overall i got it done in parts total time 2 5hrs with breaks in between have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten	10
0	do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company i just received my weslo cadence c44 treadmill and have attempted to assemble it the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console the customer service numbers are all disconnected their website gives an additional number to call and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them this company is a complete scam if you are even considering buying one of their products your money is better spent getting your head checked	10
0	is it squeeky \? yes but i did n't mind what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use i did n't use it vigorously and i'm only 160 lbs i 'd say avoid	10

0	and buy a gps instead i agree with previous reviewer \( dave57 \) i would never buy a suunto again worst than dave i simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my vector was full of water could n't even tell the time i send it to suunto finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and kindly offered a repair for 140 euros	10
0	before buying ddr i read everyone 's reviews and thought that after all of the bad reviews i might still like it this product really fools you this is why if you 've seen regular ddr you know what the pad looks like well the dance pad and the box looks normal untill you turn it on ! it says 50 songs right \? well it 's not really 50 different songs about 20 25 of these songs are a trick they combine 2 songs and make it into one track the graphics are horrible a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are i would n't reccommend buying this at all	10
0	i bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old he liked the boat well enough even played with it when it was sitting on dry land however in the water this boat is very tippy requiring two adult hands at all times not good if you have more than one kid and need that extra hand i bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer i would n't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat	10
1	this works pretty well to get back and forth between classes although you can tell that it 's a toy at heart if you 're looking for something fun and easy i recommend this scooter	10

1	this review is for nike t 90 club team \( 32 panels \) i bought this ball for less than 15 thinking i could n't go wrong i had n't used nike balls before so i did n't know what to expect it turns out that this ball flies better is softer is rounder and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls great practice ball and pick up game ball i would have no problem using it in a small club match either as far as my 30 adidas balls \? not a chance 5 stars based on performance vs price i hope you get as good a deal as i did \( through eastbay athletics \)	10
1	i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs	10
1	i have 20 mo old twin boys i was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the disney mcqueen trike so i had to purchace another one this trike has two different sitting positions has a wide wheel base for stability and sits lower to the ground my boys still ca n't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy it 's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early !	10
1	the jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient it doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them i had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said i never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal	10
0	if you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles and pins while camping then this is the item for you the instructions are made only to confuse things more it could be made so much more user friendly once it 's up it gets a thumbs up	10
1	it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff i use it every week to take drinks to sport events it 's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes	10
1	my thoughts on this bag have been pretty well covered by other reviewers this is a great backpack with lots of storage space and the shoulder straps are much more comfortable than my l l bean i recommend this bag	10
0	i purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle one of them worked perfect snug fit and everything worked the other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic this is my second and last purchase from zefal i was happy it wasnt made in china but i guess the french dont believe in good quality merchandis	10
0	this is the worst purchase i have made from amazon or anyone else the first unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable after a number of calls to tech support it was decided to return and replace the unit amazon promptly replaced the treadmill this one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function my friend at tech support did not have a clue he suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit it is not clear what i am to do with them i strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer	10
1	these gloves are pretty good gloves if you 're wanting to get started in boxing or working out with heavy bags this is the way to go they are very traditional yet slip on design	10

1	i 've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the butthead golf club cover and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been playworld putt putt there 's also no dress code involved there now on to the review ! i strongly endorse this butthead golf club cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten fun ! those teets really help my handicap like you would n't believe many clubs have a problem with this cover because they 're incredibly elitist but when i think of golf i think of cow teets and that 's why i refuse to play without it	10
1	ca n't really go wrong here a metal post some rubber grips and a couple of wheels it works great and was the cheapest i found just a tip if you 've never used it before do n't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet you may be tough but you might also hurt your back start on your knees until you know for sure you 're a tough guy	10
1	treated myself to a yogitoes mat and i love it ! it 's very absorbent \( great for hot yoga \) and very non skid it allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands wonderful tool	10
1	i just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and i needed a place to put the 400 lbs besides the floor the the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more the only thing i do not like is that it does bend in a little when you put the max weight on a slot but it does its job	10
1	it 's actually called a tent organizer and it works fantastic just hang it from any tent pole and fill it up with whatever you do n't want on the ground toilet kit socks towels etc what a great idea	10
1	excellent quality much easier to put on than the cap i used before	10
1	this gun is really cool ! it has decent aim great fire power and the charge lasts a long time the only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb 's at a time but hey you ca n't have everything anyways great buy	10

0	hurts to wear and u can barly see out of it dont get it	10
0	a real colorful and flashy bike however there were several things wrong with it 1 the tires had so much excess rubber it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed 2 the back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings if not done the bike would basically come to a stop by itself 3 the main \( front \) sprocket is slightly bent so the chain falls off constantly 4 the bike if very heavy maybe that makes it sturdy but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride i should have just bought a bike off the floor at wal mart or target for half the price	10
1	i have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather over the years i have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size this cot will provide everthing that i'm looking for my sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot the cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag the only down side to the cot is it 's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag in short it 's all a good fit and i hope to enjoy it for years to come thanks da	10
0	this backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck it would have been better with metal zipper	10
0	i bought this bike thinking since jeep put its name on it then it should be a great tough rock solid ride ! boy was i wrong ! not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy its mechanics are worst part after taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally 10 of its gears still do n't work now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job let me tell ya i stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still did n't work overall i 'd have to give this bike two thumbs down you 're better off buying a bike from walmart	10
0	this machine literally broke within the first 15 minutes after it had been assembled i could n't believe it my advice would be to avoid this product	10
0	the hr monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use no use any more also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists not at all comfortable on mine	10

0	the ski rack is attached to the thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar the old 724 had metal connectors making them plastic is insane these connectors will break over time additionally a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors	10
0	this mat gets very slippery and makes even simple moves frustrating i would recommend a different mat cheer	10

0	i was thrilled when i received this knife it was cute small and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom emergency situations however after less than a month in my purse the floral plastic cover \( which in truth i thought felt pretty flimsy when i got it \) had broken off one side and was cracked on the other sigh	10
1	this is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun but a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections \( they will jam the magazine \) pros very high cap ! more than enough for a spring gun ! cons a bit long and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit \( but still worth it	10
0	i used this ball with exercise video 4 times on the 5th day my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole	10
1	this has been a great addition to my truck a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system \( and without having to learn another techno gadget \) my only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter i realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one 's night vision but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night	10
1	i really like the heart rate monitor and it works great as has been said it takes some time learning all it does but it 's worth it in my opinion the only thing i was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit but from what i have been told by others and their brands of running watches they all do this to an extent everything else i'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone the distance reading has been right on the money after calibration	10
0	i bought this for my wife because of it 's low cost you get what you pay for she uses it a few times a week after a little more then a month the left pedal broke she is not overweight at all so that was n't the problem i 'll spend the money for a good one next time	10
0	i am disappointed with this product as i thought i was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which i give to my patients this one is made of nylon and elastic the stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use the elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart go with the stretch out strap which i have been very pleased with	10
0	i rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid 's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike i also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child 's bike straight but i never recived the part i am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they did n't help me i hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs thank you	10
0	even though this is a receiver hitch mount item it does not use a standard hitch pin it is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch \( must be bolted into the hitch to remove must be unbolted \) this totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch versatility the ability to easily without tools change whatever is mounted in the hitch bad thule ! bad	10
0	i loved it the first 2 months i had it with out notice the cable shredded i called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me it seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it the customer service is bad and so was the product	10
0	this stuff has a very strong smell like wd 40 or something if you can stand the smell you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store at least then you 'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt i bought this stuff because i thought it would be odorless like all other treadmill lubricant i 've bought but it is n't odorless it really stinks i do n't like that permeating smell in my house especially in my workout room i recommend the lifespan 100 silicone lubricant it 's a little pricier for the quantity you receive but it 's the good \( odorless \) stuff	10
1	the racquet isnt orange lol it is yellow and grey ive used it since it first came out and i love it strings break a lot it seems like i have to get mine restrung about every month but other than that its a good racque	10
1	i purchased two chairs one for me and one for my husband for me the chair is perfect i weight about 110 but my husband who is about 270 it is not so good ! ! \( chair is way to small for him \) i love it for myself because when i take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories ! ! i would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places	10
1	very cute skateboard ! very girly ! the only thing wrong with it is that it 's very gritty on the top which i'm assuming it 's like that so that you do n't fall off however it hurts ! ! ouch ! other than that it 's cute	10
1	i have used this bench for a little over a week for the price you ca n't go wrong it is sturdy and seems to be well made the adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place \( great for lying leg lifts \) all and all this is a good bench i would have given it five stars but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses this is not true it can almost go vertical but not completely still i think you would be happy with it i am	10

0	i receieved the valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous i purchased them after i lost my previous pair of tko fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems i put on the valeo straps and did one pull up and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in my advice this product is poorly made and cheap a complete waste of money go with something better and i would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric	10

0	let me just start by saying this gun is terrible the images are misleading the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic but it is a dull black and it smells really badly at first not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps and is sold at 300 my friends did n't even notice being shot i have a 300 fps pistol it leaves welts through jeans this isnt 300 fps it 's a rifle fit for an infant who 's been dropped on their head and thinks it 's good never even shot farther than 80 feet bad buy	10
0	i was going to give this product a 3 because the trays acutally quite nice just as the previous reviewer i love handing out chips in them however i re read the name of the product and i had to change my vote to a 1 these chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating not only during game play but afterward when i'm trying to store them	10
1	we bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since we just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way and she just would n't part with it my husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night \( almost 22 months old \) i was so disappointed to see that fisher price does n't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby but the prices people are asking here are outrageous	10

1	this step is great it really adds variety to my home workout i use it on carpet and it really stays put it does n't slip on the carpet and i do n't slip when i step on it i was a little worried because it did n't have a rubber stepping surface but it really does n't need it with regular athletic shoes	10
0	the product is well made and a great idea for travel without a mat however i bought it so i would slip less in my postures once i started sweating however although the paws do n't slip on the floor surface your skin slips out of them when you sweat making them worthless guess i will stick with having a towel around !	10
1	i bought one of these for friends that have children and one for a friend who is married without children they all seemed to love it !	10

0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	10
1	this product is phenomenal it reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly it worked under my wetsuit it works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming it works between your thighs or on your chest when running it may even prevent blistering on your toes while running but i ca n't directly confirm that i 'd recommend reapplying every four hours	10

1	the leek is a wonderful knife but its sword like point is subject to breakage \( throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip which is what happened to two of my leeks ! \) fortunately kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand new ones no questions asked i just shipped them the knife explaining what happened and a week later got back a new knife the knife itself opens beautifully though i 've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and is n't that easy to depress with one hand	10

1	if you 're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles this is an excellent choice it 's also very quiet and it 's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me only problem is that i wish the seat adjustment were easier to work it gets a little stuck sometimes again if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice	10

0	difficult to set up ! netting rips far too easily avoid this item ! be sure to look for something that has hassle free set up and also water resistent nylon netting thats tough	10
0	i purchased these so i would n't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat however they did n't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws additionally after only a few classes the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws particularly on the foot paws i guess they would be okay for someone who does n't ever have sweaty palms and who does n't do any intense postures otherwise i would recommend doing what i do now use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat	10
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice at first i was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet it 's continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me since i practice in a studio it 's particularly annoying i practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up the jute side is the side that flakes practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor	10
1	i bought the large and x large sizes i would say the large size is standard for most travel but the x large is best for packing clothes because they quickly fill up space the large size also includes a small zippered carrying pouch	10

1	we bought this bicycle for our son 's 3rd birthday he loved the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride ! it has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels but the bike stays steady while he is riding and does n't threaten to tip we are very happy with this bicycle	10
1	this gun is the best for your money and then some great battery life very accurate and strong perfect for competition all metal parts great value probably the only gun you will find with metal gear box for this price its a steal	10
0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	10
0	this software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit i am sending the gps i just purchased along with this software back to amazon the software will not communicate with the gps and the company will not respond to any of my support requests the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available and the live technical support is a complete joke after 20 minutes of being on hold i spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english and offered me no help i knew more about the software than him and i 've only owned it 3 days i 'll never purchase from magellan again	10
1	for some reason the electronic control panel does n't work on my bike but i do n't mind too much the bike is small and light but has enough mass so it does n't slide around i use the bike while doing work watching tv or reading it 's a great way to get exercise on rainy days	10
0	it is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market this pump is 100 junk so bad that i am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump the instructions were a disaster and why would i need to look at instructions for a pump \? well that is because it does not work and i mean does not work at all ! the lever on the side is a total gimmick \( does nothing as the previous review states \) save your money here do not buy this pump	10
1	it is the best backpack i have ever seen	10
0	even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product \( as described \) i still would have returned the item the mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it was n't really suitable for the intended purpose	10
0	this thing simply does not work ! i bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and i cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this it cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls i tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if i get better result but no luck	10
0	had to return the first one due to non functioning thermo and fault compass small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed i also have a brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer we 'll see how long the 2nd one lasts	10
1	a standard 5' bar not sure how accurate the weight is it feels more than 13 pounds but that could just be me not a big deal either way	10
0	this cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline but every single time it rains i have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle ! it is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly more damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it ! this is a worthless item	10
0	two amazon 's statements about this product were absolutely misleading 1 usually ships in 24 hours it actually took 1 week to ship it 2 when i finally received the package it turned out that the watch did n't have leather band the band was made of artificial materials \( nylon and rubber \) or something like that i will have to return it	10
1	this product is n't a miracle product but it does do a few things it supports your back it is comfortable it does make you sweat \( mostly on your waistline \) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit it 's not a bad product overall but do n't expect a miracle you have to do the work for this product to help you at all i do use it any time i'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects	10
0	there was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts my son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road he could not it is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface	10

0	the first schwinn fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit the second one arrived but does not work after calling technical assistance and being instructed to re examine the contacts \( which i did \) it still does not work this is absolutely useless they will have to do something	10
0	prior to purchasing this item i read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe i wish i heeded this advice because on top of fasciitis i developed severe toe pain by using this product i then had to by a second product anyway that thankfully eliminated the toe pain even though this is less expensive than other night splints it may do more harm than good go with a firm non toe injurying splint instead	10
1	first of all i am not a kid i am a professional airsofter i own a classic army maruis and lots of other expensive guns the best thing about this gun is that it is very powerful the sight is really good and its adjusts its also really accurate the only complaint is its kinda hard to cauk but its is also heavy which is a good thing most of it is metal my recomendation is whether you are a beginner or an expert this is a great gu	10
1	this is the perfect monitor for the average person the chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so i do n't have to look at the watch while using the machines while walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate i have n't used the other features that are offered so i ca n't rate them but it does everything that i wanted out of it when i purchased it	10
1	our card group of ten people play president which requires three decks and a large table this unit makes it easy to pass the decks around the table to whoever 's turn it is i added a teflon furniture pad to the bottom and we can easily slide it from one end of the table to the other	10
1	i used this for paintball on my military simulation a 5 i see other sights and i was worry about this since its cheaper the red and green dot is much more visible then my brother in law more expensive bsa also about the manufacture website it is a 40mm dont know why they said 30mm but like some sight the lens \( both front and back \) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up down left right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly overall it worked great i can tease tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them	10
1	the pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price the odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate the set up and operations get easier with use \( first few times you will need to refer to the manual \) the manual is well written and thorough the cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate	10
0	this is the second nike watch i ordered the first one did not work and isent it back to amazon amazon was great and sent me new one this one worked for a few days i then had the battery replaced two weeks after it stopped working by that time i had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen i have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain i am am glad i have had this opportunity to vent in short the watch is awful	10
0	these skates are very comfortable but within ten minutes the stopper had busted no wonder this item is no longer being sold	10
1	very nice good coverage of light lights can always be brighter in my opinion easy installation and good battery life	10
0	there is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw the ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side so the open knife is not away from the set of keys this is the first swiss army knife i have ever come across with this flaw so alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo ! !	10
1	i got this gear bag and love it it does n't have a lot of the features you 'll see in higher priced bags its really just a durable mesh duffle bag but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins boots masks snorkels and any other small gear like defog gloves knives wrist compasses computers etc	10
0	this product does not work the vendor is great though they refunded our money very quickly we were very disappointed because it is a great idea	10
1	this is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping you have to remember it is not a crock pot though the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware i did n't therefore a crock pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product certainly this is not the product 's fault but owner error a very good product highly recommended for campers and tailgaters	10
1	great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym it 's heavy and very dense very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym 's heavy duty takes dropped dumbbell punishment and resists damage cuts use a drywall t square as a guide and put a new blade in a box cutter take several passes to cut it and take your time it cuts straight and square for a professional look i will definitely buy these again when i get a bigger room for the gym	10
1	just a really great sports toy for kids my son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself i would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun	10
0	i just bought these gloves and wore them for the first time at the gym i now have painful calluses in my palm the glove does not have adequate cushioning for weightlifting apart from that they look good on your hand but does not do the primary job of protecting your hand	10
1	i had my knife for 10 years and would still have it if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever i leave the house one night i was heading for a flight at the airport going thru security when i realized i had it on me i had no choice but to throw it out so had to get another one	10
0	i got one of these because it was only a penny i used it several times with only a slight crack that i later cemented later i used it again and while cocking it back the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces the gun is fun for about the first few tries then it 's prone to jamming up even though it was only a penny it was 4 99 shipping i'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market i'm not very satisfied but i'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back	10
1	i bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it ! it was easy to put together just took a few minutes and away she went ! great price and i got a big hug	10
1	this ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do you 'll be surprised by the results	10
1	i just read the other reviewer 's comments yes the bag is n't huge but it certainly gets the job done it 's not the over sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks but it 's a bag that has style that 's why i got it it 's a bit more european in its design and is of good quality i dont expect zippers to break anytime soon look to be good quality also at this price it is such a good deal	10
0	package missing it 's never be received so i cannot rate it	10
0	just got it today and i am kinda mad there is a small leak near the top so i have to keep it upright or the bag gets soaked the pack itself though is very nice many pocekts for keys cell phone ipod ect	10
1	very well made product easy assembly and mounting the no wobble feature is excellent highly recommend this product	10
0	i was surprised when i received what appeared to be a sales brochure i searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if i had missed the book entirely but in fact the small clumsily put together manual was in fact the 3 75 book that i bought online it has some new exercises in it but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them	10
0	i paid bucks for tyhis gun got it and got it ready and figured out how it worksand after using it a few time si relized its flawsfirst its too damn smallits accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crapand doenst do squat in heavy battlesand the clip is a reduiclus system of shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystembuy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it	10
1	it cost 3 times its price just to ship i did n't really expect to be amazed but it is sturdy if plain the sheath does n't really make it a decent wall display but i think it will out last any cheap show sword	10
1	this is a excellent product for certain needs it is unmatched for ease of transport \( i can easily carry four of them at once \) the only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold this makes perfect sense of course if they were sturdier they would be heavier a common sense approach to usage place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge will insure safety and longevity of the product all in all a very good value	10
1	this is n't a weight loss tool it just helps to sweat off excess water retention i have noticed a considerable difference using it with my daily workout !	10
1	i am very pleased with this product it is good quality easy to use and well worth the money	10
0	overall not terribly happy with this units user interface and design the spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as sw1 sw2 etc but they are not labeled as such on the device you toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are \( tr ch what \? \? \) just an unfreindly interface all around look for a better unit	10
0	my husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it they were so disappointed \( this has now happened twice ! ! ! ! ! fyi the first one we inflated and it deflated within days \( slow leak \) what a waste ! it is so heavy that it would cost 20 to mail it back for a replacement do n't bother	10
0	the very day i received the armor abs 2 i used it and all the bands came loose that same day i see why it is so much cheaper than the 6 second ab	10
1	i 've tried lots of goggles these are my favorite i did n't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly and i remember the days when the one piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well these are adjustable strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit and it 's comfortable like the one piece goggles and has a no snag silicone strap	10
0	i received my stamina products adjustable hyperextension bench on march 13th of '07 and was very disappointed there was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box the product was scratched and parts were broken fortunately the bench works but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage the product seems to be of quality it 's just unfortunate that sps does n't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
0	this pump comes with a hose and needle for blowing up balls but there 's no way to attach it securely to the pump ! the instructions are completely useless does not deserve the one star	10
0	the bottom bolt broke a week after purchase which prevents the unit from functioning as designed it cannot swing out of the way	10
0	not amazon 's fault but everlast 's even the box promises 2 10 pound weights but it is in fact a 10 pound set of 2 5 pound weights this is not a bargain but fairly expensive quality is just ok not flimsy or dangerous but not what i wanted either	10
1	here 's a secret for the uninformed this is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish this is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get and if you 're a regular ebay seller it 's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges with this scale and a plastic bag you can weigh any package no matter how irregularly shaped and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two but remember it 's a secret	10
0	broke first time i used it when it worked it was highly inaccurate \( i own a radar speed detector \) save your money	10
0	indeed these are way too short for protecting your knuckles my boxing coach laughed when he saw them ringside make really good long wraps which are better j	10
0	i thought this would be the ultimate gym bag the main compartment is too narrow your shoes will not fit side by side you have to stack them the pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough the zippers are cheap and stick it is very pretty but not very functional my 16 00 bag works much better	10
1	on the basis of the first review here i ordered this bike and could n't be happier with it this is the first piece of exercise equipment i 've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up i use it every day	10
1	this is the best racquet i ever have i 'd been using wilson for a long time \( 5 racquets \) this one is the lightest and the most powerful i have improved a lot and no more pain in my elbow \( tennis elbow \) thank you for such a great product	10
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
1	this movie is the best b movie i have ever seen i have seen a lot but this one has it all	11
0	this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb \? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd \? what sense does this make \? what a disappointment this service is	11
1	this is definitely not the typical look at the death camps this is a truely horrific look into the reality that was the death camps i wish it was longer but the limited time reveals so much more than we ever get from all the other narrative tours with the option of just listening to the soundtrack that adds a different dimension that ca n't be duplicated	11
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	11
1	can the book reviewers please pay attention this is not the book this is the vhs movie section i see many book reviews but not a single movie review i'm glad everyone liked the book but we need to see if the movie is any good here i am sure it has alot going for it based upon the book but i have seen some movies do a terrible job what about this vhs movie \? has anyone actually seen it \? also can someone tell me how to get people to sell it for a reasonable price used rental copies for 22 to 125 is outrageous one can only hope it comes out on dvd and these scalpers lose money	11

1	the breakfast club one of the best movies out there timless no matter what 's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie !	11
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	11
1	but it 's the core 25 and if you look at this as its own piece then you 'll be satisfied the visuals are great gary cooper is great and ayn rand 's premise is all here and for those of you picking apart rand 's philosophy and its role in architecture yes the movie is an exaggeration the book is too that 's the point	11
0	i'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst \( or that level of indefatigable cuteness \) just go rent dick instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country	11
1	this is an ideal movie for home theatre i grew up on a working ranch and richard farnsworth james caan and jane fonda are totally convincing as cowboys and cowgirl jason robards is utterly evil in this movie i 've liked them all in several other movies but none are as good as this one the breathtaking backdrop and a really well written story combined with an excellent array of talent makes this one of the treasures of my western collection	11
1	i was about to buy the dvd since i found it in a store near home i am glad i read the reviews and hope that the poor sound gets fixed for the dvd and that the poor reviews get deleted \( the ones about sound quality that is \) this is one of my favorite movies and i 'd really like to have a copy i wish there were far more foreign films in this site there 's a whole world out there that people do not understand because there is too much of the same around	11
1	this is a brilliant film by a master filmmaker storyteller dark moody exciting \( and fast ! \) thx 1138 is an amazing example of style and substance so whatever you do don't buy this dvd ! instead spend just a few bucks more and get the 2 dvd version which delves into the making of the film the early days of lucas and coppola walter murch 's involvement and the whole story about american zoetrope it also has a little segment made back in the day about the actor 's getting their heads shaved all in all it is a spectacular dvd set and worth the extra few dollars \( the 2 dvd version also has a much better cover	11
1	i 've never seen the original time machine versions before but i absolutely loved this movie i am of course a big fan of special effects but the story is fascinating ! i 've watched the movie several times and every single time i'm blown away the story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds you 'll continue to wonder where the story will end up if you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel then add this movie to your collection !	11
1	this episode embodies why i love this series the bad guy is bad and makes appearances throughout the series and now this episode offers some more understanding of the wraith species and actually begs you to learn more of what initially seemed to be a barbaric bunch to kill at all costs now you really do n't know what to think except that today is a day of honor i wo n't blow it for you watch this one first if you 're not sure about which episode to sample and savor what makes this series a landmark in sci fi adventures	11
0	this movies rates right up there with schindler 's list in terms of unapologetic propaganda fortunately ted turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making gettysburg and the even better gods and generals if you want to see a real accurate depiction of the war for southern independence \( aka the civil war \) watch gods and generals or gone with the wind and stay away from movie garbage like andersonville also watch for the extended version dvd of gods and generals coming for the christmas season of 2005	11
0	i thought this video was disjointed and not oriented to any plot also the lighting was very dark and much of what was going on was unseeable	11
1	bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining	11
0	it starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end and about 2 3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion	11
0	this movie does n't have a single scene worth watching femalien 1 is in another league do n't waste your time on the sequel	11

1	i remember watching anne of green gables when i was a little girl with my sister over and over again laughing everytime anne broke her slate on gilberts head or when she accidently dyed her hair green or when she waxes poetic about her bosom friend it made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old i would recommend this movie for anyone young or old it is a beautiful heartwarming movie with gorgeous scenery unforgettable characters and plenty of moments to laugh and cry	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11
0	there is no actualy snowboarding or skiing its a boring chick flick with a ranting sissy main characte	11
0	i thought from the description that this could be an interesting film and gave it a shot it was terrible first because of the camera shake i do n't know about you but i ca n't sit trough a film with continuous camera shaking needless to say i did n't make it through the whole film but from what i saw the main actor was irritating to watch	11
1	this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great ! its good to pay less to view	11
0	i'm an animation fan and when this came up recommended to me i was eager to check it out while the animation was fine \( although a tad creepy \) i found the story off putting its basically about a bunch of dysfunctional people on drugs in a depressing future where there are a lot of people doing drugs a k a substance d i found this film depressing and annoying i particularly found the 'blur suit' to be distracting to watch it almost gave me a headache 1 star did not like	11
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11
0	this film really made me angry and pissed off i bothered watching it the characters were cardboard and i ca n't believe ingrid bergman starred in this junk the main character totally lost it believing all what her husband was saying about her she was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con	11
0	ca n't understand what all the fuss is over this movie it 's cute but so boring i could hardly stay awake	11
0	one of the worst movies ever this stuff must have been made up and total lack of common sense makes this movie an amatureish comed	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
0	except for two cuties william zabka and dana ashbrook ! especially dana who constantly having a hard on	11
1	this movie is a wonderful follow up to the first anne has the same charming spirit and the cast is just as wonderful as they were the first time i highly recommend this movie to anyone	11
0	i'm a firm believer in freedom of speech but honestly this movie was disgusting without any redeeming qualities the product description listed above is completely misleading it 's basically a movie in which the abusers abuse and degrade their victims and then at the end they slowly torture them to death pretty much the worst movie i have ever seen	11
1	this film is a stunning tribute to the memory of all the victims of this tragedy and to all the heros who contributed to our triumph of the american spirit	11
1	this was the best series on television in the late 1980 's my sister and i never missed an episode yet it still is n't on dvd i can buy i love lucy and dawson 's creek but i ca n't have all three seasons of my beloved vincent and his velvet over gravel voice what the heck gives \? please put this out on dvd ! !	11
1	i 've never seen a movie with a more accurate depiction of life in the ussr from late 40s to early 50s what people had to live with psychologically far outweighed anything physical for the average person buy this film to understand	11
1	this movie really surprised me the first time i saw it there is much more depth to the story than you would think martin short is very funny nick nolte is great and the little girl is adorable i highly recommend it	11
0	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show	11
0	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
1	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie for those expecting a movie like a hard days night it is nothing like that this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady i wont tell u the ending but this is a true story all in all i thought this was a great movie you should defiently buy it	11
1	lucas is one of corey haim 's 80s greatest movies i have the dvd you too gotta go get it \)	11
0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
0	so not at all what i was expecting i had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it i was terribly disappointed and confused	11
0	okay i was excited to see this movie i read a few non fiction books on the dot com bust and thought i knew a thing or two but when i watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more i found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from i mean who cares about these people 's relationships \? \? not anyone who is watching this movie ! we care about why and how businesses succeed and fail this movie sucked	11
0	off hand i ca n't think of a worse movie \( and i think nicolas cage has done some truly awesome work in other films hey he 's making a buck here \) that 's all 1 32 star if possible	11
1	even though this cinderella does not have the modern day movie magic \( in fact the sets are pretty corny \) that does not hurt or take away any of the wonderful memories of when i was a little girl and looked forward every year for the airing of cinderella and the wizard of oz i was thrilled to have found this and would highly highly recomend it to any 40 woman out there that has the memory of this wonderful version of cinderella leslie ann warren is simply timeless in this	11
1	we were amazed that this film was n't an award winner it is an excellent film and you might even see some style similarities between howard roark and frank lloyd wright	11
1	i have seen this movie many times while growing up its definately a different approach to science fiction but not too bad basically you get to see how mortal enemies can work out their differences and work together a movie with a message	11
1	what most people fail to realize is that most life story movies are not made for the purpose of glorification to the viewer but to let them know of the real life trials and tribulations of that person how can you criticise someones life story \? to go threw what they went threw to see what they saw and to experience life threw times when life was almost impossible to grasp \? i think josephine baker was a very great person regardless of her nationality anyone with the guts to live life to the fullest and overcome impossible barriers deserves much praise	11
1	when you consider the physical condition olivier was in his performance is pretty damn good the supporting cast are mostly excellent with diana rigg a standout as a venal vicious voracious yet strangely feline and alluring regan and dorothy tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful goneril leo mckern is the definitive gloucester	11
1	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11
0	almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree	11
1	jlo finds out that she cant run forever from her abusive husband so she learns krav maga and gives him a a s kicking to remember	11
0	i love nature and cowboy movies jeremiah johnson was on of the best movies i 've seen it is unforgetable it was my favorite robertredford movie he did very little talking talking in this movie he just acted his best performance ever the movie deals with the american indian also in a profound and touching way this movie is engrossing and based on a true story it 's simply the best do n't miss the opportunity to see this movie it is a classic it truly is in a league of it 's own	11
0	this is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen a must see so bad it is funn	11
1	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit	11
1	i love it sooooo much it's the big new thing can't wait 4 the next episode	11
0	im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with \? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	11
1	the spice girls are the best ! and if you are a spice fan than this is the movie for you i love i	11
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11
0	this movie is watchable but barely its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions and see leatherface as a never mind youllhave to see for yourselves we have a yound renee zellweger in this one	11

1	ok i 'll admt it when i first saw this movie i was only 6 or 7 i thought it dumb and pointless i also thought 'omfg ! what was that teacup thing for \? it was soooooo pointless this movie is stupid ' now i am 13 and i saw it again on abc family then i thought 'wow ! ' this movie is so cool ! i then understood what theteacups represented and everything i thought it was a great movie truely hilarious too of course it does teach a sort of lesson about surviving in the world but i never found it until now this is a very cute movie and i really think anyone can enjoy it	11
1	i love this movie so much i first heard about it while listening to a henry rollins spoken word performance \( i know so random \) when i was in my teens i went out and rented it right away and i have watched it about 100 times since then i tried to get a copy for years without realizing i could just order it on amazon it 's such a sweet touching story it 's a bit off the wall but that 's of course what i love about it	11
1	this movie is so good i ca n't even find it anywhere if you come across a copy of this buy it it is reminissant of american history x or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen aged boys comming of age while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen this will hit home for the rest of us drugs are bad ! !	11
1	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don't look now back in '73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	11
0	i'm sorry i really really tried to get into this movie and just could n't it was just plain boring normally i love these types of movies but not this one i just kept waiting and waiting for the 'point' or for something to make the last hour and a half of watching it worthwhile never happened i would recommend renting this one first just to make sure	11
1	when worlds collide has all the ingredients of a great movie for the year that it was made the actors were great the story is scary when you start to think that this can happen the ending was excellent not a happy ending for mother earth but not all end of the world movies should have the earth been saved i bought the movie and seeing it many time and still like it	11
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television do n't bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd	11
1	the classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film the film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness welles is excellent as edward rochester the tormented master of the house joan fountaine is wonderful as jane look for a very young elizabeth taylor in one of her earliest roles this material has been done many times but watch this version	11
0	the plot of the story was ruined by the immorality and language this could have been a beautiful story if sexual immorality and profane language had been eliminated it is possible to have something beautiful and clean where when you finish you feel that you have experienced something encouraging and uplifting dying young and the plot of sickness and someone caring is beautiful falling in love is beautiful but it is degraded by stooping to immorality i threw it in the trash as i would not share it with those that i love	11
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
1	this is a wonderful movie and i have always enjoyed it from the first time that i watched it when i was 20 something then to see the actress that plays miss ellie on dallas in such a young roll it was excellent the story is endearing and shows the many facets of ones life	11
1	i think this is a great movie about a guilt stricken ira gunman based on a book this movie will make you laugh cry and excited this is a must	11
1	cannes man was funny i do n't know why this movie was in the drama section of blockbuster but it made me laugh out loud just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who do n't know their s from a hole in the ground	11
0	this movie is a dog pure and simple we ended up with two of these are the freebie give aways for the last few dvd players we bought they ca n't sell it so they 're giving them away hide fast	11

0	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie	11
0	i ordered this the night of the oscars i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging it looks like a bad vhs transfer i should have returned it but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be but unfortunately in my case i have to add buyer beware	11
0	i downloaded it and i could n't view the video paste the intro then i re downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file but it again it only had sound and not video this one is a waste of money	11

1	justice in the criminal justice system \? what is that but empty talk in the real world \? in hell shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife 's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system no macho van damme kickboxing here but a portrayal of his progressive instincts in an environment of hate a true portrayal of life in today 's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men and corrupt power brokers who run them	11
0	this review may sound pretentious and ignorant but in truth i'm a big fan of british history so bear with me ! even as a film itself it 's surreal and i do n't like the acting but as with any historical film that includes the british they 're made out to be the absolute bad guys ! sure we were forging an empire within france \( i e the hundred years war \) but rapists and murdering pillagers ! \? never ! historically accurate full of british sentiment and down right weird avoid this film today folks !	11
0	to put it succinctly brendan fraser is a college senior who ends up writing a ridiculously long thesis which is then swiped by joe pesci the homeless dude who predictably is really quite wise the problem is that his wise sayings are n't really too wise he 's like the guy you know who is always trying to sound intelligent but does n't really know that much joe pesci 's character is pretty annoying that 's probably why he ended up friends with brendan fraser 's character	11

0	even though fans of hk cinema have as a whole come a long way since hk films were generally only seen in the states on saturday afternoon television some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing hk films in their original language with subtitles this film is available from columbia tristar only in a dubbed format and for that reason i wo n't be getting the region 1 release of this film	11
1	i rented the movie and i hav n't seen the first three but this one was pretty good it was n't the absolute best horror film but good pace of the movie good plots and story line i do n't recommend going out and buying it righ away cause you should rent it first and decide for yourself	11
1	it is an fantastic concept for a movie plot just how much trouble can a frozen man from the past get in \? this man is even less refined than tarzan but has a better sense of humour if your feeling down and want a pick me up this is a must see	11
0	as ex infantry i found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable this low budget movie spoils the book a supposed highlight is the sas field craft but that 's a bad joke the sas troop crowds around for camera shots all the while talking loudly if not shouting bog normal infantry do n't do this never mind the best of the best the sas the fire fight sequences are passable the interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but ca n't make up for the rest of it the foul language even if it 's what they used in the field should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot making it unsuitable for many audiences	11
1	this movie is among the top 10 of my favourite movies of all time ! it not only honours the life and achievments of the great christian man alvin york it honours many truths of the christian faith god 's power to to transform sinners the virtue of forgiving your enemies putting god before man the virtue of earning an honest livelihood though it does all this it is not a preachy movie it simply tells the amazing story of a simple farmer who becomes the greatest hero of ww1 other movies in my top 10 include it 's a wonderful life forrest gump shawshank redemption to end all wars les mis rables	11
0	i found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives i was constantly wondering where i would draw the line if i was the heroine the experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy daydreaming	11
1	this is one of my favorite movies ever it really captures life in the 1800 's slums and you really get attached to the characters there are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters this is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams i 've seen this movie about 3 times and each time i see it it is just as good	11
0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11
1	funny and witty this movie will keep you going especially if you love the play by oscar wild	11
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	11

1	this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous \( to me \) movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september now who is this robert mulligan anyway \? lovable little gem	11
0	jane fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful if opinonated \( remember hanoi jane \? \) woman i watched this as a teenager and despite the striptease this has to be one of her worst hormones be damned watching this was a waste of time if you like fonda try klute she was an excellent actress but no one could survive this mess	11

0	a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband \( everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron 's husband \) jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull	11
1	this is my favorite film bar none mpi home video is releasing this title on dvd 5 15 07 according to mpi 's official site in addition as of this writing \( feb 07 \) this stellar film is showing in theatrical re release in as many as 30 american cities this film has everything an epic should have a first rate cast beautifully written screenplay spectacular \( and mostly historically accurate \) settings even solid humor i 've been waiting for this to be released on dvd for years	11
0	only worth the second stop motion sequence when flesh fights a robot twig that scene is almost flawless and as good as any harryhausen animation the one love scene with flesh and the hot curvy brunette is also nice the film is worth a rent if your curious but it 's really just a lame and unfunny movie if your open to seeing a trashy sci fi satire of flash gordon with some interesting special effects give it a look especially fans of stop motion animation in which the film features 3 creature sequences	11
1	100 men and a girl is rank sentimentality with a great sound track it deserves to be on dvd for the sound track alone durbin 's rendition of the mozart alleluia sends chllls down the spine	11
1	there are tons of women in prison films out there there are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive however this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action pam grier as a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the mistreated women from prison the comedy mostly came from the sexually deprived women who were full of one liners and crazy notions but of course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison explotation film lots of nudity violence bad laguage and did i mention lots of nudity it 's worth seeing ! if you like it also check out the big doll house	11
0	ok so claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work yes the martial arts are weak at best but i still own this movie and watch it just to see raul julia go over the top why do they still call me a warlord \? and mad \? all i want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier not for power not for evil but for good carlos blanka will be the first of thousands they will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary every creed every nation ! until the world is in the loving grip of the pax bisonica and peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude	11

0	movie got 2 3 through and just quit no problem this is windows right \? just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11

1	i wo n't spend a long time explaining why i like this movie it 's just mindless fun and that 's all it needs to be a movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch and while it 's not the funniest or clever done comedy it 's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them plus that blob thing is just too freaking cool	11

0	i bought this as a gift for my nephew because i loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie i'm very glad i screened it first the female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow boring and illogical i'm not very pc with old movies but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits choose one of the other disney re releases instead there are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog	11

0	maybe it 's because he is such a stright shooter \( pun ment \) or something but clint does n't do cold war thrillers very well \( remember firefox \) while well directed and acted this spy thriller is dead most of the way through and while the climbing scenes are good they do n't cover up the fact that it was a good book that does n't watch as good as it read some may like it but i found it to be a let down	11
1	great movie excellent condition and as always shipped quickly and in good shape	11

1	if you have read and enjoyed the book then you will love the movie micky rourke is excellent \( this is still in the days when he could act \) and so is the rest of this stellar cast well worth it	11
0	this movie is far from being anything great some of the characters do n't make any sense what so ever with the original cast leatherface 's role has been mocked people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface the first tcm is a classic and the second tcm is great as well but leatherface tcm iii the next generation and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi enough is enough	11
0	fredro starr is a good actor in fact what ever happened to the group onyx \? but this film is cliched and predictable rhea perlman looks out of place this is a 2nd tier above the rim	11
1	we have all wondered what would happen if the alien and predator met head to head this movie answers that question very well no cheesiness we have watched this movie so many times we have lost count and we still watch it sitting on the edge of our seats or our knees to our chest great saturday evening movie	11

0	i read this book for a project two years ago i was n't about to finish this book and had to move to another one first off this book lacks emotion this character is so boring she does n't seem to ever feel sad or mad and to me a book without emotion is just unreadable i hated this book but i do n't like most scott o'dell books just go read another book	11

0	michael moore can be really funny at times but most people should not take this goofball too seriously about half way through 'the big one' i turned it off because i did not find it the least bit funny and i did n't know where moore was going what is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of cheap trick \? this is not one of his better films	11

0	this is absolutely no improvement on the poor vhs video tape a travesty i subtract all stars for the terrible transfer menu and options	11
0	why should one buy this series \? what about the missing episodes \? are they going to be added later or this is it \? i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel \? or a keyboard without the c and r keys \? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do	11
1	one of my all time favorite movies great story great acting great casting directing superb i cry everytime i watch it	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
1	veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television although the show has been focusing more on veronica 's romantic relationship than in the past the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show the acting for the most part is top notch and kristen bell who plays veronica is amazing i especially enjoyed episode 9 spit and eggs in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus	11
1	probably one of steve mcqueens greatest movies only this one can happen	11
1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it 's got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers \( like me \) and adults alike highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me	11

0	sleep with me would be completely worthless if not for a quentin tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of top gun that lasts about two minutes the remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious ersatz neo bohemian characters except for tarantino 's top gun bit \( and the twenty seconds or so when parker posey has her shirt off \) there 's nothing worthwhile here	11
0	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you 'll miss him	11
1	this is my favorite cardio video right now because the video is only 30 minutes long i can easily fit it into my day i found the choreography fun and uncomplicated i especially love the addition of plyometric moves and core conditioning to the cardio i can feel those assets tightening up	11
0	very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish ! can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it	11
1	i love this story for my boys it is now a story i put on for my grandson it keeps their attention and there is always something going on i do wish that the few cuss words that were put in this movie had been ommitted you should explain that this has nothing to do with your religous beliefs it is really entertaining i love the bird and i love the song bright eyes i would recommed this for anyone 8 and up i do n't think girls care for it as much as boys	11
0	this movie is laughable today it 's very dated and it shows it 's not worth your time the acting is so so but felt forced \( like william shatner style \) the storyline is okay by today 's standards it appears like a low budget flick	11

1	i had never seen this movie and i dont know why ! freddie bartholomew \( top billed as a teen ! \) is an obnoxious rich kid who falls overboard and is rescued by portuguese fisherman spencer tracy over the next few months a bond forms between the two that is both honest and touching a terrific olio of pathos comedy melodrama and good common sense make victor flemings adaptation of the rudyard kipling novel \( which im embarrassed to admit i never read \) one of the best movies ive seen great supporting work by lionel barrymore john carradine mickey rooney melvyn douglas more and freddie is quite the beauty here a winner !	11

1	the lived tragic story during the ww2 in a small town of the occupied czechoslovak a carpenter is hired arian controller in a modest and humble bottom store where her owner a jew old lady thinks the best about him unknowing what' s really going on backstage i few words a major film told without melodramatic effects but told with asserted expression and crude realism another amazing evidence of the artistic foreseeing three years previous to the invasion	11

0	the movie is widely considered a classic for hong kong action movies leslie cheung is a fantastic actor and i enjoyed bridgitte lin very much in chungking express so even though i do n't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies i still decided to watch this movie i was extremely disappointed the cinematography is boring and poorly done the plot is juvenile it is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys i hated the movie however i fully understand that many many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important hk movies ever made	11
1	this movie would probably not be on anyone 's top ten list but it is a must see for the 1980 's b flick movie loving enthusiast ! the stuff is an interesting look at consumerism in the 80 's and the hairstyles and outfits are just plain hilarious ! i remember renting this movie \( on beta \) in my childhood over and over again much to my parents chagrin the stuff will bring you back and make you glad the past is where it is	11
1	this is the first episode where we really see the heart of tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father a must see	11
1	this is a beautiful movie but please have no misconceptions about what you 're getting into it is not a traditional love story it does not have a happy ending you are taken on an incredible journey and grow to love these innocent people who burn with passion then you see terrible undeserved things happen to them but it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting it is a story about the human costs of founding a nation among many other thought provoking things it was shamefully overlooked in 1998 and i do not understand why it has not been released on dvd i appeal to fox searchlight please dvd this soon	11
1	wonderful and beautifully transferred to dvd excellent production numbers and this just might be my new favorite judy movie grab that bucket of popcorn pop in the dvd and let judy do her thing she is wonderful it will be just a fun evening	11
0	this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! fats the dummy steals lots of the scenes the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act ! burgess meredith is great as the manager one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see fats but during some of the more romantic scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush don t miss the extras where they talk with the real vent that worked with them on the movie if you like movies that are a bit outside this is a must have for any collection pete cavan	11

1	this is an excellent documentary of shangri la and its elusive transcendental nature	11
1	this is by far my favorite version of this classic story and the most authentic and true to the spirit of the book the cast and direction are excellent and the setting is gorgeous this film will delight both children and adults with it 's adventure suspense and innocent romance it 's a little spooky in some scenes but of the fun rather than truly scary kind this story has a very positive underlying message but does n't preach rather it expresses it in subtly beautiful ways as the characters unlock the mysteries of the secret garden and of themselves no matter what age you are this is a thoroughly enjoyable uplifting perhaps even transformative film do n't miss it	11
0	this film stinks it gives b scifi a bad name even makes those roger corman movies look stunning if possible i would give it a negative rating to balance the positive reviews seen here if you want cornball underwater action buy quot voyage to the bottom of the sea quot provided that your cerebral cortex is active you 'll agree it 's a zillion times better	11
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	11

1	this is a great picture that i think grant morrison was imitating in his first issue of quot the invisibles quot it has cinematography and acting that repressed hollywood would n't get away from for another few years great ending that completely caught me off guard a very complete film	11
1	i just so the uncut version of this movie and if you like perverse and grotesque movies you will enjoy this an uncut version can be purchased at trashpalace com check it out	11
0	hard to believe that sidney poitier went from directing a classic comedy like stir crazy to this music video not ready for mtv type of film very 80 's campy it was corny then as it is now	11
1	i saw this on tv and loved it so i had to buy it	11
0	quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book hopefully they will remake the movie soon because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice	11
1	moore shows us that outsourcing was big when clinton was president he makes you ashamed of big corporations that value money over employees big one will open your eyes	11

1	this film really shows the versatility of peter sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting this is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch the quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source frankly you forget that it is in black and white format	11
0	i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids \? apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i'm not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth	11
0	this movie is not for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird sure there are plenty of plot holes reeves is in it so do n't expect an academy award however the plot is very interesting \( again filled with tons of holes \) but i watch a movie to be entertained not to be a film critic or to analyze everything overall if you like weird movies like fear and loathing in las vegas this movie is for you if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how true to life it may or may not be well just skip this one	11
1	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
0	this is not one for the uncoordinated i only tried it once and have no desire to try it again also beware that this is not the best pick if you have only a small space	11
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11
0	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	11
1	i think simply put if you like bob dylan and just want to have fun with a movie then you 'll love it the performances bob gives are excellent and it 's great to see the ensemble of actors they lined up all together if your not much of a dylan fan and like your movies high and mighty better just pass it up	11
0	well do n't know where to start bought this one because it has jeffrey combs in it stuart gorden is director and they did a good job on re animator but let me tell you horror freaks will be disapointed only one really bloody scene is worth watching not because of the blood not because of the gore just because it is the only bloody scene in the movie a nice looking woman is eaten by the castel freak if you have seen re animator the evil dead from beyond hellraiser and maybe the thing then skip this one you will be disapointed like me even a john woo action movie has more blood in it	11
1	freddy rules ! i remember growing up and being afraid of freddy jason on the other hand never scared me to much he was just a big dummy who walked slow now watching the end of the movie how can anyone say jason won \? jason went down in the water and never came back till the end freddy survived only to be killed by the teenagers them selves by slicing off his head freedy won ! but anyway its not a bad movie freddys make up looks great and glad to see him on the silver screen again	11

1	the fly is fantastic and well worth a watch goldblum 's performance is also just outstanding for a really cool creepy interesting and engaging film this is the one fly 2 not so good so dont bother the extras and presentation on the dvd is also great adding to the package here definately worthwhile if a little cronenberg splat isnt gonna offend and watching what could have been a really tacky cheap project done really really well sounds good and if it doesnt get over yourself cause it is	11
1	overwhelming in sincerity and pain to watch and observe stephan 's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time this cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour i was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish a great cast and a great script push this movie forward to the top of my list	11
0	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11
1	this is the best of the best hands down this is one of the best broadway concerts you will ever see colm wilkinson lea salonga michael ball are all amazing fabulous talent great singing	11
0	so this movie is made of 2 stories the first one is quick and involves takeshi kaneshiro and brigitte lin both have their stories and i actually found kaneshiro more interesting so this thing ends and the movie should have also it should have been a 30 minute movie so for the next hour or so we get to watch tony leung chiu wai sit around his apartment in his nothing but a white tank top and his briefs wow what a movie the only positive to the second story is the girl who listens to the same song all day she was fun to watch but i still wish i would n't have seen this dumb movie	11

1	having watched this dvd only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting the tour de force of sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed the highlight for me was carol burnett and the hilarious performance of everyone needs a maid only carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour i do recommend this dvd and i look forward to veiwing the disc again on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner	11

0	i wanted to see a romantic and touching movie this movie is contrived the character that reeve plays acts like a star struck groupie personally i do n't find his behavior to be romantic he seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him this is not romantic to most women nowadays he is not suave in the role he is playing it seems like a cheesy 70 's contrived romance that does a bad job of it	11
0	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11

1	i really enjoyed this movie the characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job if you 're looking for something heavy this is not for you this is a lighthearted movie that west indian people can relate to on many levels it is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them i have seen this alot all in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain there is good music dance and jokes cant done latah	11

1	high energy encapsulation of the american spirit in this tough tender production done lean and hard scrabble as opposed to the lush and green hollywood version curley really is as wonderful as he sings he is aunt eller the matriarch as done by maureen lipman is tough and loving jimmy johnson the welshman jigs and does rope tricks shuler hensley 's jud is repulsive and vulnerable a classic for your permanent library	11

0	an incredibly bad film whose only redeeming feature is lana clarkson in \( and out of \) some skimpy outfits she 's completely gorgeous but even she ca n't save a disaster of a film buy deathstalker instead	11
1	some of the best lighting i have ever seen on face of that hunk c tommy john peters is a genius	11
1	the characters are likable there is some decent progression and growth seen over the course of the film but only about half of the scenes are necessary it seems as if they just wanted to give gene wilder a few more chances to be quirky gene is a funny guy there is no doubt about that but enough is enough ! the film is family friendly except for a few instances of harsh language and violence but it is really nothing compared to the sorts of things that get into theaters these days it is worth a look but only if you 're willing to deal with some pretty decent stretches of time when there is not a lot of progression in the story	11
0	this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five year old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that 's great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books	11
1	my brother henry always said this was his favorite movie he loved film noir \( although i did n't know what that was at the time \) and of course he loved richard widmark in his role looking back widmark should have gotten the academy award for best suppporting actor for this \( he was nominated \) but there are many oscar should 'ves if you like prison gangster movies classic film noir richard widmark victor mature and of course brian dunleavy you 've gotta see own this if you hav n't do n't already	11
0	this movie is great if you want to go to sleep and you ran out of boring books ethan hawke leans to heavily on kris kristofferson 's performances not to mention jeff tweedy 's music as a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music it is written interestingly enough but the visuals look like there was n't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on the best way to watch this movie is in the background you do n't need the visuals and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away	11
0	there are not many movies i have switched off after the first 30 minutes but this is one of them and i recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise	11

1	this movie rocks man i'm so happy that they finally produced a stephen king script almost entirely true to the original story more than that it 's about 99 accurate they added some stuff like a new female character played by julie entwistle that was n't in the book but it turned out to be integral to the enhanced ending normally i'm very critical of people who watch these movies without having read the books first but this time i think i can confidently say that even non readers should like this movie it 's a masterpiece of suspense and gore rent it folks and call him the night flier	11
0	sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the u boat men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of u boats machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful	11

0	i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it 's cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in 2004 it ai n't that much better on a whole	11

0	i have to disagree with the reviews above and say that i watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago unfortunately i could n't find anything about this film i remember enjoying it 's a cross between the blob the thing and a really crap detective movie moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie this film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through i guarantee it no suspense few laughs and way to hokey to watch twice if you love this movie you need to get out more	11

0	between the amended politically correct ending to this famous tale and the so very hokey interaction between kirstey alley and lloyd bridges i could n't wait for this to be over ! the animation was very poor quality the music was not the focus my grandchildren lost interest shat else could possibly have been wrong	11
1	this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i do n't see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after 175 mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy	11
0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
0	i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids \? apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i'm not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth	11
1	micky dane \( robert patrick \) a paparazzo photographer is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder this movie has great action good acting and really catchy music body shot is another robert patrick movie that i 've seen multiple times \( probably about 12 so far and still counting \) you gotta love patrick with his blond hair ! i am biased and give this a perfect 5 stars	11

0	most l amp h fans know that the boys made a long series of mgm fox pictures which reflected the big studio quot assembly line quot film making approach and the wartime atmosphere students of film comedy understand how the quot traditional quot stan amp ollie would be somewhat suppressed in that regard however it 's very sad to watch a decent premise with great performers go completely to waste as it does in aaw the presence of edgar kennedy should lift th proceedings instead it reinforces the melancholia i found the drunken scene most distasteful still l amp h followers might want to place it somewhere on their video carousel for an occasional peep into what could have been	11
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11

1	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times ' to reference hannah arendt this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description	11

0	dont purchase episode 5 of season 2 it 's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the charlie murphy prince story wtf ! ! ! can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re download ! ! !	11
1	being a fan of the better cg and graphics of sci fi such as star trek \( the newer ones \) i was greatly surpised at how good the v series was v the final battle is the second installment of the saga so make sure to buy v the miniseries first the storyline is good and characters are likeable and three dimensional i highly recommend it for any sci fi fan for old hands it is a fun movie and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction	11
1	this is a very dark film kevin reynolds illuminating allows him to describe somberly the hard and bitter conflicts with the students in a high school but this picture has nothing in common with to sir with love this is much more than a simple fairy tale carefully made script and a brilliant performance given for samuel jackson	11

0	this was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by sir arthur conan doyle it did n't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters the plot and scripting are incredibly weak it seems the editors just stopped mid movie and rolled the credits there the cgi dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their animation was very stiff in my opinion not worth the 83 it costs	11
0	i have to wonder what world what physical plane what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on \? or maybe they are full moon employees lol first of all the movie especially one of the earlier scenes was identical to the 80 's flick the unnamable which is also and hp lovecraft based flick the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit when he breaks out his cell well this was just hilarious it reminded me of the incredible hulk yes jeffrey combs is in it but his acting is cheesy as it can be hunt down the unnamable instead a much better movie	11

1	cary grant was a great actor with countless memorable films although that this film is not amongst his very best it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure it is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some disney influence but grant offers us one of his typical \( in a good sence \) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs enjoy it	11

1	i really like these tapes the first one is pretty easy but it is very relaxing and i use it on days when i want to take it easy the second one is somewhat challenging and the third one is even more so these tapes are a great guide from a beginning level to a more advanced one tracy rich is a very good instructor and makes you feel comfortable i also like how they \( ganga white and tracy \) show different versions of the poses with one being more advanced	11
1	i loved it the movie arrived so quickly it was awesome it has brought back a lot of memories from my past thank you	11
0	i must admit that i am a guy and that i bought this movie before seeing it i was not shocked with the horrible acting but was surprised with the hot stars this movie had both hot guys and girls the actor that caught my eye was steven albrecht freddy he is so hot we get see him completely nude showing off his hot body he did a great job in his breif scene josh edwards trian was okay to look at too as for the actress venesa taylor is also hot	11
1	all 3 wiwag are excellent this is more than just a well put together documentary its very moving because of the footage narration and music you do n't feel like you are watching a dvd about baseball it feels like you are watching a snapshot of americana from the 50 's and 60 's after watching this you wish that things today were as they were back in those days not just baseball or sports but life in general as it was protrayed in the dvds	11
1	csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i 've only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great	11

1	wow there are so many parts of this movie i just simply did not remember but still a great movie especially with the deleted scenes they are not up to scratch but i am not holding it against afterall the movie is 18 years old but still allot of fun to watch	11
1	thank god that there is a full recording of this evening available on cd because this video only shows about 45 minutes of the actual concert granted they are 45 minutes that are not to be missed with this brilliant cast and this amazing show from stephen sondheim this is truly a broadway event the documentary which makes up most of the running time of the video is a lot of fun but cutting the actual concert down to bare bones is a sin we who adored sondheim should appeal to the producers and beg that this magical night be released on video in its entirety	11
1	one of th ebest comedies of the middle 90 's this is basically your average quot rich kid learns to be a man quot story it features several of my favorite gags such as the fish stick kittens and the mermaid if you have never seen it this one is wel worth the look	11
1	this is a truly funny movie the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night it 's a good buy for your dvd collectio	11
1	this is a pretty original 70s horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era katharine ross and sam elliot it 's just fun not really all that scary or even too tense basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance roger daltry makes an appearance the deaths are all way over the top and it 's just fun dvd is the movie plus a trailer that 's about it but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire	11
1	i have watched most of the bs series and this is one that shows what is happening to many of our american organizations religious control	11
1	well written well acted and well directed this is much better than 99 of all films on tv or in the theatres the only reason it is unknown is its adult content marijuana smoking and romantic affairs lending amusing background to a woman 's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life this is that rare bird an intelligent film for adults my favorite line joe mantegna 's remark to mia farrow you 're really interesting after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible it is not a 5 star film like say witness but it is an excellent small film this is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	11
1	for me quot get a life quot provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy from chris' unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space alien \( in home video volume 2 \) which is anything but cuddly i only wish rhino would expand its offerings of quot get a life quot episodes	11
1	i have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and i wish it would come out in dvd my liking it has something to do with john 's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the direction of the characters through the machine once he damages the typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again you ca n't beat that we even get to see a perplexed robert wagner and the rest of a great cast	11
1	i must say that i am generally not interested in watching a romance movie but this movie is a definite exception it possessed a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly captivating scenery that is incredible and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story from beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie it piques the curiosity it warms the heart and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it buy it you wo n't regret it	11
0	just as the other mothers have stated nothing about this pump is beneficial it was given to me by a lactation nurse but it was more trouble than it was worth only once was i able to pump more than one ounce \( it took almost an hour \) and i hurt so much afterward nursing my son was agonizing i only needed it occassionally but this was such a waste of time i bought the pump in style which is amazing this is not comparable to the more expensive medela pumps so if you want something that works with little discomfort invenst in the pump in style or similar model do n't waste your money even if it is cheap	12
1	in terms of pre natal resources this is the best i have found ! the positive results are proven i can not think of a reason not to buy this product every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child this system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born you will even notice a response from your baby ! it 's very exciting	12
1	my 6 month old got these for christmas they were among the first toys she expressed any interest in she loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg but it broke i emailed baby einstein and asked if i could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite they are sending a free replacement ! we love baby einstein and our daughter loves these blocks	12

0	this monitor is only great if your house is smaller than our tokyo apartment although the monitor is sensitive and clear moving the receiver any more than 15 feet away from the transmitter results in intermittent and loud beeps indicating a loss of signal	12
0	do n't buy this sheet ! ! it is not much thicker than a piece of tissue paper ! spit up would go right through it i have a much better solution for you buy a couple of sheet savers to use in your pack n play they are a couple of less and are sold as especially for baby \( which is b r us house brand \) they are great i use them for both my son 's crib and for the pack n play they come in a number of colors so you should be able to match them to just about any pattern	12
0	i thought tiny love products were good so i bought this the first one i received had the water leaking out the second one does n't make bubbles and after a few days the music already sounds like the battery is dying my baby seems to like it but it does not live up to what it advertises	12
1	we like this stroller it seems to be pretty durable and its weight and portability \( shoulder strap \) make it ideal for trips especially in airports my husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall \( 6'4 \) but it is fine for me \( 5'3 \) we like it for our 5 month old son because he is able to recline but still sit up enough to watch what 's going on he can hold his head up well but is n't sitting up unsupported yet so the various levels of the reclining back are nice overall a good stroller for the price	12
0	i received this after much debate about the prior review had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer so i bought it and sure enough had the same problem amazon was great they sent me a replacement and still the same problem my baby is due any day so i am keeping the first one but sending back the replacement it doesnt come as described no blanket included and i dont see how you could adjust the wedge i am very disappointed with the product but happy about amazon 's willingness to assist in the issue	12
0	i bought the avent breastshells because of my sore nipples and a way to collect leaking milk while i was not nursing and relieve some engorment 1 it is very messy when removing the colleting cap2 my nipples are still sore3 and the only way to relieve engorment pain is to nurse or to pumpif i would have known about these factors i would not have purchased this product	12

0	i don not like these washes at all the scent is very very overpowering ! ! ! ! ! i had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong i do love the case though it is sturdy and has lots of room	12
1	this seat along with the matching step stool are great ! my daughter loves having her very own special toilet seat and step for going potty it has encouraged her to potty train it fits the toilet seat nicely and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well	12
0	this piece took forever to assemble arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces the directions are vague everything in the diagrams is a rectangle ! but the actual parts are n't labeled so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean when finished all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it they have no bolts to hold them in the just sit in shallow slots the drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable also as many of the holes are not lined up so i could n't even put in some of the bolts	12
0	this is o k if you 're using it as a restraint only if you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart forget it i thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars wrong it hardly covers anything i went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything i wish i would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat	12
0	in order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy you need it to be digital and use digital spread spectrum \( dss \) technology 900 mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor though here 's why it is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2 4 ghz devices this includes baby monitors and cordless telephones the correct arrangement should be baby monitor 900 mhz digital spread spectrum \( dss \) wifi netowrk 2 4 ghzcordless telephone 5 8 ghz digital spread spectrum \( dss	12

0	i own these bottles they seemed nice but there is a design flaw with the nipples there are two pin sized holes on each nipple over time filth and germs built up in these holes they are imposible to clean i didnt notice until one day i started seeing filth floating in the bottle im thowing mine out	12
1	this product works great you hook it to your medella bra with rubber bands and pump with hands free to do other things i am so glad a coworker told me about this product	12
0	we had better luck than some the gate lasted about 2 years before the locking mechanism gave out called customer service and they said it is n't a replaceable part too bad it was easy enough to install and worked well up until it did n't anymore the click is pretty loud we found ourselves trying to close it two handed to avoid waking up the baby disappointed it did n't last as long as we needed a gate but my daughter is only 2 1 2 and i still need a gate at the top of the stairs i'l be replacing it with a different product obviously	12
1	my daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it \( at 8 months \) it was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first i took one star off due to some minor problems 1 \) it is not machine washable \( unless you do n't mind loosing the barking sound \) and 2 \) the battery ca n't be replaced	12
0	i have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers if i install this lock the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening it also means that i would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet i'm returning it	12
0	this is a great gate if you have a strong healthy back and always have two hands available but how many people with kids have both of those ! it was great at keeping my baby in the room but my 4 year old could n't open it and neither could her grandma and it made me and my husband want to cuss it is back in the box and in the return pile do n't waste your money	12
1	i used this with my third child i washed it over and over and always the stains came right out it 's so soft ! ! ! ! definitely a good buy	12
1	i have been very impressed with every avent product that i have purchased i have found these pacifiers to be so nice they are completely clear and you are able to see smiles around them my baby loves hers we ca n't live without them	12
1	we were very pleased with how easy this was to install despite the fact that we have rather unusual banisters ours is actually a half wall and half banister but the plastic was just flexible enough to bend over the ledge the directions were n't great but it was fairly self explanatory we feel much more comfortable letting our one year old play upstairs in the loft now	12
0	i found the product highly unsafe as a stroller the handle is very flimsy and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller also the wheels do not lock properly and safely its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve	12
0	we have the graco ultra clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years with a new baby on the way we thought we 'd upgrade to the new technology oops it turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the ultra clear \( could n't even make it to the other side of the house \) and the reception was quite poor and the annoying beeping was the clincher i sent it back today and bought another 40 ultra clear oh and i tried the fisher price private connection also and had the same issues	12
0	we bought this travel system because it is light to be lifted and comfortable but the chest clips are so uncomfortable to close and hard to open specially the one that goes between the legs it is so hard to buckle and unbuckle that i'm afraid i'm going to hurt my baby every time we have to close or open them and is complicated to align them to finally buckle in fact i had an emergency with my baby and took a lot of time to open these clips	12
1	this is a good quality item for the money i love that the rails fold down so it is easy to make up the bed and change the sheets i just bought a second one for grandma 's house !	12
0	i bought this potty seat for my daughter and i took into consideration that this was supposed to fit regular and elongated toilets the second i put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet ! the seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets that is a lie my toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through a waste of money and a safety hazard	12
0	the item pictured and described is not the item you will recieve i ordered 4 pakcages of these diaper service diapers and got a completleydifferent diaper these are thicker better quality and have blue stitching and gerber stamp on them that distinquish them to be the diaper service diapers the diapers i got were thinner plain white and had no stamp buyer beware ! you will not get what you see in this current photo	12

0	this was the second pump i purchased i was hoping that it would turn out better than the first brand i bought this pump is a pain in the neck to put together and the pump that is not hooked to the ac plug in is much weaker than the other side the motor died out after 2 weeks of use this pump is not meant for everyday use i just bought a medala and i hope to have a better expeirence with it	12
1	well i felt a little silly paying about 20 \( with shipping \) for 2 pieces of plastic 2 bra hooks and some rubber bands however the kit does work and does allow you to pump hands free one word of caution if you use medela 's quick clean steam bags to clean your pump parts take the hands free plastic sleeves off before throwing the bag in the microwave ! otherwise they warp and do n't fit right	12
1	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old my husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier at 10 months he still enjoys playing with them they have lasted through both children i would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them	12
0	that would be one of my problems with this pump it hurt it took forever i did not have a good expereince with this pump	12
0	this tub is a waste of money i bought it this evening and i'm returning the tub first thing tomorrow morning water leaks at the hinges creating a mess and a slippery unsafe floor very unsatisfied with this product	12
1	i thought these were very good quality considering the price i like them better than the one i bought at bru that cost much more	12
0	i bought the bottles and when i used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we	12
0	i hate hate hate this potty ! the shield will not stay on my son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying here you go it is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty there is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no go for a little boy	12
1	my husband and i adore this monitor it picks up on every little noise our little one makes which is great we occasionally get some interference but all i have to do is move the monitor and it goes away the interference never occurs on the unit in my baby 's room just on the parent unit so you do not have to worry about waking the little one up i love the rechargeable battery option and the ability to carry around the unit with me throughout our 2 story house i plug it in at night by my bed and it then runs all day long ! you can defintely trust this monitor	12
1	this bin is great for cloth diapers we love ours keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two 's worth of diapers which is all i need because we wash every other day our local babies r us sells replacement deodisks \( or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors \) when the one that comes with it loses it 's smell so that you can maintain freshness it 's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive	12
1	baby has had less gas and fussiness since we have been using these bottles quick cleanup quick fill up love the nipple variety too because of the liners it is easy to keep two of these bottles in use and not clutter up the kitchen with bottle pieces etc would highly recommend	12
0	it 's not just the most icredible piece of junk i ever seen it is the most dangerous piece of junk i ever seen on the market for kids the plastic is very thin very weak and bends every each way my daughter weighs 35 pounds and the step almost collapsed under her weight is slides off the toilet bowl and the seat itself also bends down under the child 's weight which really frightened my girl there 's no way a child should use it without an adult actually lifting it and putting it on the seat i feel soooo stupid to have bought it \( \(	12
0	it 's a chunk of plastic with some bits of rubber attached effectively serves its purpose but for nearly 16 bucks \? ! ! puleeeeeeeease	12
1	i love it ! this is probably one of my most used baby items it is so handy to use while we are out and so easy to clean i 've bought this as a shower gift for several of my pregnant friends	12
1	my son loves this toy although i think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color he is 10 5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy a good buy and will keep them busy	12
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat nhtsa \( national highway traffic safety administration \) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description	12
0	if you are walking straight without turning then this stroller is good for you but just try turning and especially sharp turns you 'll be stalling and getting stuck the entire way	12
0	seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants so now it sits in my car fading in the sun save your money	12
1	the medela breast pump works with dr brown 's bottles \( you can pump directly into the bottle \) ! just an added benefit to an already great product i 've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had no problems it 's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding pumping for more than a couple of months	12
1	i love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use so now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth if i had to do it all over again i would still buy this swing b c of the design i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall	12
0	they are messy when they opened i get milk on my hands and they cost way too much i do n't have much room in my freezer when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate it 's like 17 for ten	12
0	this is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid it 's easy enough to install but hello ! what 's to stop anybody especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together \? not a thing ! the kit that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it 's closed it does n't fit snuggly around the seat so it 's completely loose total and complete piece of junk ! !	12
1	the size is bigger than i thought but i loved it my son fits in nicely	12
0	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in but really it took up too much counter space i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary i found save your money	12
1	the safety 1st cosco portable crib is great ! i purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits it 's small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another i would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib it is very sturdy and also attractive	12
0	for some reason the product was not delivered ups returned it this was send for charity after many emails and phone calls the company refuses to respond or refund the money shipping was more than the product	12
1	i bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers with the touch of one button i can keep track of how long it has been since i fed my baby i do n't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone the first unit i was sent was defective and i received terrific customer service when i contacted the company i am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because i 'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well maybe a future model	12
1	this seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for suvs in contrast to one of the other reviews \( and i am not affiliated with the seat manufacturer \) this seat does the job adequately and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs measurements fit etc imho there is no quot universal quot seat saver or for that matter car seat that will fit every car this one manages to catch most of the itty bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat and hence serves its purpose well	12
0	these bags leaked for me from both the top and the bottom the fold down mechanism is very cumbersome especially because the plastic is very stiff i lost three bags of milk due to leaks if you have to transport the bags anywhere like back and forth to work like i do i would avoid these bags they just leaked all over the place for me even after i carefully re sealed each one exactly according to the package instructions i would recommend the lanisoh bags over these	12
1	this is a well constructed cute bounce seat and my baby loves it i am very pleased with the purchas	12
1	you will need this extra base ! ! i ordered it thinking it would probably be a good idea to have the day after it arrived my mother in law was sick and could n't come over and watch the baby so my husband placed an emergency call to a relative and they were able to come over and pick him up i had the original base with me at work 40 minutes away before this all happened	12
1	absolutely love it and it 's a great quality too for this price \? \? \? \? i just ca n't believe it ! !	12
0	this bra is very comfortable once on getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head it rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body as far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed which with a baby is all you usually have to work with the star rating is only for comfort 0 stars for function	12
1	this product is amazing i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them ! ! super easy to clean and use when ordering these i was under the impression that there were 2 per package fyi they 're not ! ! only one per	12
0	i had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub i would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off i ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad but then it became just an expensive knee stool the knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why i give it 2 stars rather than 1 i returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price	12
0	i received a box as a shower gift and they worked okay unless i changed them a lot though they ended up leaking i was resigned to just living with wet spots until someone gave me some of the lansinoh pads to try i have no idea why babies r us does n't arry them but they really need to these things absolutely do not leak they hold tons of liquid	12
1	i have a home daycare so this chair is used constantly i 've had two of these for well over a year and today i bought a third one i 've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far nothing beats the swinging tray i would recommend it to anyone	12
0	i bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage i'm a 38 dd and use the large flange for my medela pump so i too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola nipple the ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend \( great proper latch ! \) and treatment for a mild yeast infection hope this helps	12
1	i liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece my baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so i also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider i could adjust the wedges one more thing this comes with a mat this saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much i bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick	12
1	any easy to use lightweight booster carseat highest scores from consumer reports made it our first choice	12
1	i received this pack n' play for a shower present this weekend and it is absolutely adorable set up it is very colorful and the the toys are cute it was very easy to set up i am not good at putting things together and it took me about 5 minutes total the matress comes out so you can put it on the floor with the toys overhead it is very multi functional	12
1	when registering for baby needs i laughed at the idea of wipes warmer i thought what a waste ! after my newborn startled and screamed during diaper changes i rethought this this product has been a life changer ! baby is much more comfortable now and the warmer works great easy to use the wipes stay moist and are easy to get out remember to purchase the pop up wipes however great product i would give as a gift	12
1	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt \( i have a small frame and it is big on me \) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done very friendly amazing customer service that 's hard to find these days !	12
1	my son is going through potty traning and he hates those toilet covers he just wont sit in them so this product was our solution for him when we are out it is small but my son \( 20 months old \) fits fine in it ! the problem is i ca n't find the liners anywhere	12
0	i'm on child number 2 with this chair and my complaints are the same 1 they tray is way too high for an infant young toddler to reach anything my son is 8 months old and he can barely see what is placed on top of the tray 2 it is a cleaning nightmare i am still finding food from my first born hidden in this chair ! good points pop off tray divider that keeps them from slipping out cool colorsi tried a friend 's cheap evenflo chair and i loved it 100 times better and it cost over 100 dollars less	12
1	my newborn loves this seat the calming music and the vibation helps calm her when she is being fussy ! easy to put together and take down if you want to take it with you great product !	12
1	my daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and i was always worried that she would get cold especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter i saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl ! she wears it every night now and i know she stays warm throughout the night the only suggestion i have for anyone thinking of buying this is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one mine is growing so fast that i will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long	12
1	this item is worth more than the cost it is a most have at home with a new born baby expecially 1st time parent like me i can get to do other things once my baby is asleep and i can even hear my baby 's heart beat when am somewhere else in the house worth more than trhe cos	12
0	i ordered two of these cots for twin 4 year old grandsons to use when staying at my home i expected the cots to be fairly sturdy perhaps along the line of a porta crib instead the frame does n't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily the twins tried them out after being cautioned not to jump on them the cots did n't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them i returned the cots to target	12
0	we bought this item because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else we had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it we have to attach it back on not very durable	12
0	i bought this right before my daughter was born and have used it every day since she was born 4 months ago a week ago it just stopped working i really liked this steamer and it had served me well but now was just not turning on anymore so i went out and bought the exact same steamer i used it for 2 days and then on the third day yesterday it would n't turn on anymore i'm taking it back today and getting something else	12
1	we have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it ! the peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless i used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly and i do not miss that i can cook dinner or watch a tv show in a relaxed state without worry it has always worked well and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately the picture is clear the sound is excellent you do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in but the cords are all generous in length we would go nuts without it	12
1	our 3 month old was maybe a little too young at first but now that she 's 4 months old she loves this toy ! we recommend it !	12
1	my wife and i bought this item for the usual reasons we washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding they 're just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them if not a little softer for the record we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes they went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting anyway i'm just writing the review to offset the bad review there was nothing wrong with the pads that we received and they do what they 're supposed to do get between the warm baby and the cold changing table	12
1	this is the single best new baby item that i purchased ! ! i was a mom who swore that my baby will never sleep in my bed needless to say that did n't last 3 nights i got this co sleeper and it was just perfect felt much more secure with him in there very portable too i took it everywhere for the first three months	12
0	not only did the product get delivered 3 days later than expected my child 's grandfather who is in the construction industry installed the seat and the entire set broke off of the bowl the first time anyone sat on it and nobody in this household is overweight	12
1	i had checked out booster seats on the internet and in stores and this was by far the least expensive it 's a bargain well made and easy to use my grandkids seem to like it better than a high chair the seat arrived minus the safety straps used to attach it to a chair when i wrote customer service about the problem they sent a whole new booster seat	12
0	my son hated this mat at first then he played in with it for about 5 days after that it got old ! mighty quickly my son is now about to make 5 months old and he does n't even want to look at it waste of money for me	12
1	i gave this stroller as a gift so far there have been no problems	12
0	i was really disappointed in this sealy ultra it does not feel like a very good mattress we 'll use this for a couple months and replace it with something better i 'd say you need to see the mattress decide the one you want and then look for the best price on the internet	12
1	the zanzibar collection is bright and cheerful animal images are unusually cute i mounted the wall hangings with velcro so they can be taken off the wall the baby enjoys touching them and seeing them close up	12
0	this would be a great space saver but now that gerber has started using the plastic tubs instead of the jars we never used it at all ! ! now gerber makes their own feeding center to accommodate their tubs and i love it	12
0	this toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move it ends up moving all around and i can not see in the mirror the plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat	12
0	this seat is very dangerous and set my daughter 's potty training back months the seat folded and fell into the toilet while she was sitting on it ! thank goodness i was still holding her ! she did get pinched and was afraid to sit on the toilet for a few months after ! potty training is stressful enough on a child without a defective product making it worse ! the only reason i gave it a star is there is not a way to save the review with out one	12
0	we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature which worked a little too good the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out i 'd hit it and knock it out of place so i had to readjust it all over again sometimes when we 'd hit bumps it would fall and become worthless finally my little girl 's arms got long enough that she could reach it and it ended up breaking	12
0	we loved this toy when my daughter received it for christmas she loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself ! this morning i looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty ! the water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections ! it 's not exactly fixable so we will move on to another crib toy	12
0	i purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it which makes it impossible to close with one hand even if you do n't care about the one hand feature it is still a hassle to adjust i do not suggest buying this gate	12
0	lucky for me i didn't pay for this pump but the hospital gave it to me i could only get two drops of milk for every ten pumps what a waste of time you would figure the hospital would know if the pump worked	12
0	i do not like these bags the twist tie closure system is cumbersome the bags are small the plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen the only advantage i can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly	12
1	we got this before our little one was born she was born a little premature and only 4 lbs we used it in her bedside bassinet and later in her crib although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours baby girl is now two and we continue to use it she 's in a toddler bed now and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she 's not supposed to ! this is a great device and everyone should have one comparible in price to other nursery monitors you get so much more it also has clear sound and little interference in our house	12
1	i heard about these blankets from a co worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter they are the softest blankets i 've ever felt there 's a reason this company 's name is cloudb ! the only reason i gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges not a big deal i just snipped them with a scissors but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished	12
1	i too was given this pump by a lactation nurse i pump at night after my baby goes to sleep i think the pump is great ! it does what i need it to do and it very comfortable the only drawback is that is is kind of loud i would recommend this for a mother who needs to pump occassionally	12
0	to see how worthless the graco lovin' hug swing is the baby in the swing is lying perfectly still and is 21 pounds \( the swing has a supposed 30 pound limit \) the swing is on hard floors is brand new as are the batteries and still the swing barely moves at all even on the highest level ! when i contacted the company they told me that the swing wo n't go as high when a baby gets larger but this brief movie proves that it wo n't go at all ! ! instead i highly recommend the fisher price ocean wonders aquarium swing i only wish it held a larger baby so i could continue to use it !	12
0	this is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and do n't stick to my son 's highchair at all very disappointing	12
0	i bought this to keep sun out of my little ones eyes when we 're out running not only do the tabs not stick as any toddler would she protested being behind a curtain during when she just wanted to see the world would n't you \?	12
1	my baby is now 5 months old and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	12
1	we have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars this was the perfect solution because you can place the tie down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long so they will fit around large or small bars we had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with would n't reach but it was very easy to do i also like this product because it does n't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision	12
0	my husband and i were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born he has been using it up to now and i used it this week for the first time our daughter is 9 1 2 months and 21 pounds it was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone the problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain i have after just a two mile walk ! ! ! i ca n't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk ! ! ! i would never recommend that someone buys this !	12
0	i received this steralizer as a gift if i had to do all over again i would have never put it on my registry the steralizer is messy everytime i lift the top to remove the bottles water is everywhere in addition i have to keep a dry towel under the steralizer to dry up the water that spills out there has to be a better way	12
1	if you are going to get a manual pump get this one i got a medela from the hospital and it was sooo slow and killed my hand but this one is way better it takes 5 10 minutes to get the same amount it took 30 minutes to get with the medela and it does n't hurt your hand at all because you have to pump the handle far less often because of the massaging petals and because you use it for less time total i have never used an electric pump so i ca n't compare it to one of those but as far as manuals go this one is awesome	12
0	i bought this bundle me in nov and it did not even last 2 5 months the zipper broke it is not well made stick with the other bundle mes the urban bundle me is cheaply made not worth the pric	12
0	buy the baby bjorn before you waste your time and money on this hunk of junk no matter how i tried i could n't wrap my baby to where i felt he was secure and safe and comfortable plus it took forever and my baby had no patience to wait for me by the time he was in he wanted out	12
0	why bother with a boppy cover when it does nothing to protect the boppy from spit ups and poop accidents \? it 's not practical to throw the boppy in the was each time this happens i can only imagine how stinky this boppy will soon get	12
0	i tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed the suction wo n't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table on the kitchen counter top \( formica \) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal i am returning mine to the store today dissapointing but they are darling colors and the lids are a nice feature	12
0	this is the worst pump you could buy i have gone through 3 of them because the motor breaks down it also has put me behind in what my daughter is drinking while i am at work please do n't waste your money i also spoke with hospitals and they mentioned that they have many many complaints about this product if you do n't believe the bad reviews call the hospital and they will tell you the same thing i recently got a new pump from a friend and found that the evenflow is by far the loudest pump on the planet there is no descreet pumping for you if you own this product	12
1	if you have an ipod or mp3 player i 'd recommend getting this i think the baby is going to love it ! i bought it last week and tested it out \( our baby has n't been born yet \) the speakers are plenty loud enough for a baby 's crib or room imo and i'm 1 2 deaf i also like the little nightlight on it that changes color my only criticism is that it takes batteries \( no ac adapter \) we may invest in a rechargeable set of batteries if it uses batteries up quickly for 20 i think it 's great	12
0	i like the concept of an elevated design they should make the sides breathable i have had my son sleeping on this since he came home this has been 6 weeks so far he twitches and moves his legs and arms and such typical baby stuff he ends up slidding down in between the wedges i tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up you would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in he slides no matter what when i put the towell to high his head slid off the edge good idea needs work	12
1	we just installed these this weekend on our upstairs banisters they 're great they 're strong enough to keep our 11 month old baby from falling through we pushed and pulled on them after getting them all fastened i still intend to watch him carefully when he 's up there but these will definitely protect him in an emergency just be sure to follow directions tie them tightly ! ! they 're not that bad looks wise either i can still see my spindles through the netting so the look of the stairway is basically unchanged of course looks are less important than safety ! i think i'm going to get these for our outdoor deck as well i 'd recommend them	12
1	this potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces it is also more stable than others we used we like it	12
1	i bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind which i love come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often you really are supposed to do that because otherwise you will get an breast infection especially if you live in the south where it 's warm and humid i recommend the ultra thin pads the other ones that come in the variety pack are just ok	12
1	the snuzzler works well for our small baby in his graco metrolite stroller it supports his head well and he seems very comfortable sitting on it	12
0	we do n't have our baby yet but have tried the tub to see if it works the first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it this second one the spa works but the shower does n't the company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor will try it again with the new motor of if the third one does n't work we will return it and get a different tub and probably something else for that money	12
0	do n't waste your money on this high chair by the time your infant can safely sit in it they will have almost outgrown it you 're just paying for the name brand not the quality stick w a graco instead	12
1	this pail does not need special plastic bags you can use leftover grocery bags etc which is a big advantage i do n't know why people buy those diaper pails that individually wraps every dirty diaper a baby 's poop does not smell bad !	12
1	very efficiently drains about as much milk as i can get with the pump in style advanced for me and very portable and easy to clean i use it when i have a little more time or when i do n't expect to pump more than a couple ounces \( between feedings \) despite medela 's warnings i would say you could use this to pump daily aslong as you are careful to fully drain the breast \( massage \) but maybe not okay for maintaining supply for multiple pumping in a row	12
1	my daughter received these instruments as a gift last christmas and took to them right away she was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds we have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites just the right colors size and shape with just the right sounds ! she has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys they really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children	12
1	i love this item it has soothing music sounds and animation easy operation baby loves it too arrived quickly and well packaged instructions on manufacturers box thanks fisher pric	12
0	after only 2 months this toy fell apart my daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail 's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams 20 is not cheap for this toy and i think the quality should have been alot better	12
0	i bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same other covers i 've seen just slip on this one has to be tied on also it does n't cover the entire cart there is an opening that my baby 's fingers always find where he can touch the icky cart handle not a great product spend the extra money and buy the better one	12
0	do n't buy this humidifier ! it is much too loud	12
0	i did n't even get to use this pad it fell apart in the washer the first time i washed it the vinyl in the back ripped to shreds on the delicate cycle \? \? \? \? \? \? what 's up with that \? what good is it to have a mattress pad that you ca n't wash \? total waste of money i am taking it back today ! !	12
0	my son is ten days old i tried these bottles and was highly disappointed the liners are a pain in the butt once you prepare the bottle and get the air out of it if your child does not drink the whole bottle it collects air again i changed to dr brown 's bottles and my son is having less gas and is n't wearing his food	12
0	we have the 49mhz whisper connect and love it \( see our review of that one \) we needed a second monitor to replace a 900mhz fisher price monitor that is 4 years old and decided to try this one out we set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up we thought we must have a defective unit so we returned it and got another and we had the same problem there is no interference or static with the monitor but also no sound we 're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it	12
1	even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny ! it is so easy to put in the buggy ! my son is comfy and fits in it very well !	12
0	i bought this product as i was going on a long trip i put the batteries in the mirror and it did not work i put the batteries in the remote and it still did not work all that would happen is that the little red light would flash and you could n't even turn it off without taking out the batteries waste of money !	12
0	it does leave mineral deposit on the bottles even if you use distilled water it is worse if you use tap water it does n't help if you clean it with vinegar after each use as is directed when you lift the cap all the water drip you will need a lot of towels to clean the water after each use the plastic lid of this product is not appropiate because it gets soft from the heat you wonder if it is going to melt i am a fan of gerber products but this one does not work	12
0	i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow i returned it	12
0	you have a spilt second to get the wipey out and then it gets cold not to mention the warm moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria especially if you are wiping then put your hands back in to get another wipey	12
0	i thought this would be a great way to keep my newborn son 's head elevated while helping him feel snug and secure when he slept the first night we used it my husband went in to check on him and he had wiggled his way down so that his head was right between the side supports he was horrified that our son could have suffocated this was after i had made sure our son was snug between the supports and they sat under his armpits i suppose the sleep positioner would work if your baby did n't move at all	12
1	these cloths are awesome they smell great and do n't crumble like other brands they work well forsponge baths when there 's no time for a real bath ! love them	12
0	the swing was easy to install and i did not need extra tools or help unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal it was even enough however and i put my daughter in the swing was tilting a little far forward but i could not adjust it the worst part was getting her out the tray was near impossible to undo from its locked position i guess i did not need to worry about her falling out i was just wondering if i would be able to get her out at all i 'll be donating the swing	12
0	this seemed like the original johnny jump up i had for my first child 13 years ago we loved that one so i got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together it did n't work very well it just did n't seem as springy as it should be i ended up returning it and getting the 40 version with the tray instead \( the jump go \) people have complained about the tray pinching baby 's fingers against the doorway but we have a wide doorway so it works well and is a lot springier also our little guy likes the toy tray on the jump go version a lot	12
0	this lock works good for a little while then the push mechanism breaks it may or may not break completely off so it could still work even when it breaks i 've gone through two of these already and they only lasted a few months before they broke	12
0	i bought this product thinking it was different than the standard square playmats i like the scalloped edges the pillow and the colorful pictures but i am disappointed in the playmat overall the pat mat leaks so bad that i ca n't use it the playmat is cute but it is n't functional not to mention way overpriced the arches have netting which i think freaks my son out he has never liked this playmat i have a square one that he seems to enjoy more	12
1	i love this bath tub ! we were not happy with my son 's infant bath tub so we were anxious to move into this one ! it fits so nicely in the big tub and offers my son the added protection he needs when you 're done with it it just suctions to the bathroom wall to dry the best part is that we 'll be able to deflate it and store it easily it 's also great for traveling	12
1	this new maclaren stroller is fantastic ! we just returned from three weeks in france with this great stroller it can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street it is very light and we love the new shoulder strap i have 3 kids and this is the best stroller i have ever used	12
1	well made and well priced your kid will find a million and 1 uses for it more than you dreamed of as you loaded it into your cart buy buy bu	12
1	if you are flying alone with a small child you should not go without this it 's a tight fit but it works	12
1	we took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at disney world it was great ! ! it held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses monorail etc i am very pleased with this purchase it was great to have it in the airport too the only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked but we can get a replacement	12
1	i bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all i love the color the material is easy to wash and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable i have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly my only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months the bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving other than that what you see is what you get ! worth every penny ! ! !	12
1	it is still waiting for the baby to arrive so i have n't used it yet but i do love the utility and design of it	12
1	my daughter loves this activity center i wish they would change two things about it i wish we could change out the toys and it folded up	12
0	i used this pump less than 10 times with my first child and just got it out to use with my second since i'm engorged and found out the motor is broken i'm very disappointed since i trusted the medela name if i could afford it i 'd replace it with the pump in style but unfortunately i 'll have to try a manual pump	12
0	this is a great pump for a mom who only needs to pump once or twice a day let down happens very quickly and i can get 3 oz in 15 to 20 min my baby is a month old and i use this pump so i can occasionally leave my baby with a sitter geat pump at a great price	12
0	i picked this up at my babies r us store because it looked like so much fun for my baby and with the mirror i would be able to keep an eye on her from the minute i brought it home it smelled awful like artificial grapes i have aired it out in our garage for two months now and it still stinks at this point i am just going to throw it out because i ca n't imagine having that smell in my car ! \( i have since been back to babies r us to see if the other ones they have smell as bad and they do \) do n't buy it without smelling it	12
0	i bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier this bag was ok to start and fit my britax \( a feat in itself \) but 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it broke i would not buy it i emailed the company and have yet to hear back	12
0	these come in both boy and girl colors the picture shows pink purple and yellow bottles i received blue and green bottles i contacted amazon who promptly sent me another three sets \( all of the first three sets were wrong \) in the second shipment they only got one set right i e mailed to return these as well when i sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because they had already replaced the items be careful when ordering from this site	12
0	i just took a course from the florida highway safety program i thought something like this would be wonderful especially for little ones in the rear facing position i was dead wrong anything put in front of on the side of in fact anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash this toy even latched down poses a threat to the baby he or she may just have to be bored for a while on long trips have mom or dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment	12
0	the shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small do n't waste your money it 's not worth it !	12
1	this is a good thing to make your home safer for your kids this is a pretty boring product but everything worked just fine	12
0	the design is pretty narrow my 3 4 months baby was far more under the pounds as the product described the product tightened her so much that when she was in it she would cry unless you have a very small and quiet baby otherwise it is not a wise choice	12
1	awesome awesome awesome ! my hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality design and function about products and he loves this carrier i liked the price and my son loves to be at the same level as everyone else he tolerates being in this more than his stroller this was my first choice based on all the feedback thanks	12
1	i actually bought this netting to use as a cover for our baby 's cradle \( we have two cats and did n't want them to nap in it while the baby was n't in it \) i 've used it once for my pak n' play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep in her jogging stroller after a walk in our neighborhood since it was such a nice day i let her nap in in the stroller \( it fully reclines \) with netting covering the entire stroller i feel that for such a low price this netting is worth it for whatever reason you chose to use it for	12
0	this worked great for a couple months then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise the gears must be slipping my poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move then gets scared at the loud clicking popping noise and starts crying really sad	12
1	excellent product very difficult to find in stores can safely heat breastmilk and formula in a warmer healthier than heating in plastic	12
0	these are a complete waste of money the nipples flow too fast for a newborn i tried using them many times during my return to work transition and my daughter choked and cried during each feeding she also swallowed so much air i was burping her for what seemed hours the bottles are too expensive for just storage you can purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made by evenflow for 3 99 personally i like to use the storage bags laid flat in my freezer they take up less space	12
0	there was a crack down the side where it was put together and nicks in the wood we didn't have time to send it back and they only offered us 20 oo for a discount very dissastisfied ! will never order form here agai	12
0	i purchased this wipe warmer because i did n't want a warmer that heats all the wipes those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless the top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes well this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box it did n't even heat the whole wipe ! i am returning the warmer it is a complete waste of money	12
1	this product works well with my dr brown 's bottles there are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks i use a sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it wo n't scratch the bottles though the sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	12
0	do n't buy peg perego their customer service is horrible ! ! i will never buy from them again ! !	12
1	great fun product my baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min couple times a day we own it from 2 months he was 4 months old he simply loves it he jumps and plays with the toys absolutely the best buy	12
1	this stuff works wonders for my son 's sensitive bum and fast ! we usually see results in just one application usually by the next changing the irritaion is gone or nearly so it also has a very natural herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams it may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison but i 've found that i do n't need to use as much which makes that argument mute	12
1	i ordered this at christmas with the free super saver shipping the crib arrived within a week assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable it 's attractive but my only complaints are 1 \) it did arrive with about five different chipped gouged areas in the white paint \( this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint \) and 2 \) the bolts are exposed on the crib it would have looked better if they had provided caps overall i'm very happy with the crib and the price ca n't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in may	12
0	i gave my father in law a couple ideas for my son 's \( 1 year old \) christmas gift and this was one of the items boy do i regret giving him this as an idea it is a cheaply constructed toy the bus 's hood does n't even work correctly the toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise ! the toy held my son 's attention for less than 5 minutes my suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market skip this one	12
1	i bought this portable tent for my graco pack n play because my toddler can climb out of it and i wanted him to be safe we use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100 peace of mind knowing that he wo n't be able to escape and injure himself it is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely my only negative comment is that it 's a little difficult to put together i usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity	12
0	the suction cups were bent and just did not stick to the high chair or anything else for that matter my 6 month old daughter just likes to play with the animals they crinkle and delight her	12
0	i accidentally ordered this one instead of the kolcraft universal carrier since they are both called the universal carrier this car seat carrier is over engineered with too many moving parts that are completely unnecessary rather than returning it my husband wanted to eat the 59 99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat we went out and purchased the kolcraft universal carrier it is much simpler easier to fold and has a large functional basket underneath the car seat	12
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it i love the theme but the mobile was a big disappointment it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it also although the mobile matches the theme i found that the colors were n't very stimulating we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it	12
0	i bought several versions of the bundle me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit ! i am so frustrated by this ! why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe \? \? \? we took our car seat to the katie cares safety check today and they took all of the accessories off we had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe save your money and buy a version that goes over the seat and baby not under kidopotomus makes one	12
0	the baby bjorn is a nice carrier i received one for my baby shower however i hardly used it i thought i would use it a lot but i found i hardly used it after the first 3 months cause my baby weighed too much before that the many straps made me afraid i was going to drop the baby but probably the same problem for other carriers i was really surprised by how little i used it since i really wanted to carry my bab	12
0	i bought this product for my 3yr old at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times at first she did n't want to sit on it again amp she cried when i took her to the bathroom but i told her i would sit her on it amp i would lift her off since i have been doing this she has n't been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched	12
0	pinched my daughter 's tush \( even though it was opened all the way it bent as she was getting on \) she never went near it again have to be very careful as child is sitting down	12
1	i purchased this booster seat with the intention of using it on our upcoming vacation only but it has come in very handy while visiting family and friends as well it is easy to set up and take down and is very compact when folded my son weighs 16 pounds and my nephew weighs approximately 25 pounds both have used it and neither one seemed uncomfortable in any way we 've only used it a handful of times so far but i ca n't think of one bad thing to say about it we 're very pleased with our purchase	12
1	my eight month old daughter really loves these instruments ! we bought them when she was about four months old but when she picked them up she 'd often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around i brought them back out when she was six months old and had a lot more arm control now she really goes wild with them especially the bells !	12
1	this product was recently purchased for my 5 1 2 month old son 's stroller by my mother in law i love it i had an older hand me down version for his infant carrier but the new ones are better i love the fact that the new version has velcro so you can easily move it from car seat to stroller or from one stroller to another i only wish it came in more colors color combinations	12
1	i like this product it is very stylish and lightweight definitely i highly recommend to anyone	12
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat nhtsa \( national highway traffic safety administration \) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description	12
1	i brought it when my baby starts to know how to open the closet the suction is good and my baby now unable to open up the closet i going to buy more for my other room	12
1	finally found this item ! i could n't find this anywhere locally it is easy for the kids to use and it is easy to clean	12
1	some of the pieces were dent when i opened the box it was too late to returned it back i found out that wood was dented after i had trashed shipping box	12
0	tired of hearing your baby cry \? this is the monitor for you you 'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing looks like evenflo was being literal when they named the product whisper connect you can barely hear anything at full volume i'm going to return it tomorrow if i can resist backing over it with our car	12
0	my daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times ! i am returning it first thing in the morning i should have never let her on it a second time if she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over please do not buy this product	12
0	this is not a good product unless you 're willing to screw one of the parts into your door which we were not since it was a newly installed hi quality door and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so as a result the double backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off you ca n't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person \( large or small \) trying to open the door it just is n't going to hold up it 's a nice try but in the end was a waste of my money	12
1	this product is great it is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it but i found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier makes my life a lot easier with my 1 and 3 year old	12
0	there are so many other sling out there do n't waste your timeor money on this i hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot it was also impossible to adjust i got a couple of slings from www equanimitybaby com and one from www peppermint com and love these bottom line check out the other options this one is a waste of	12
0	for the price of this cradle swing i 'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than i got first the stand seemed a little wobbly you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they do n't lock into an optimal position even worse however is that after less than two days of use the lights sound and mobile stopped working calls to customer service were a complete waste of time and i ended up returning the item while the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable i 'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive papasan cradle swing	12
0	the walker has a few flaws first of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal it is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child 's head my son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker constantly the seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high it should be roomier and drop lower	12
1	my 6 month old daughter just transitioned from her infant seat carrier to the britax boulevard and is loving it she looks comfortable in it and i really appreciate the side impact support in case of an accident i can really see her growing into it as well it is a little large for our camry but there is still enough room for one other person \( instead of 2 \) in the backseat	12
1	i love this key and cell phone set so much i'm buying another one for a friend i looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall my 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone \( actually even my older kids think it 's pretty neat \) great product great price	12
1	i received this as a baby shower gift from my mom and love it ! it is so easy to manuever you can do it with one hand the stroller has ample space for bags purse etc below and side pockets for cell phone or smaller items the drink cup holders for mom and baby are a plus the material is so pretty and the colors are great the best feature is how the system allows you to completely protect the baby should you get stuck in the rain or other bad weather i would highly recommend this item	12
1	the booster works great does not slip on a chair and is easy for my 2 year old to move around on her own i highly recommend this product	12
1	i love this potty chair ! ! it is so simple and that is what i like about it simple to use simple to clean my little boy loves it	12
1	this item is a godsend and one of the most useful things i received ! i cannot imagine my day without it my daughter loves it !	12
1	i am a mother of 6 and this works you can put a few baby neccessities in it i use it for a few diapers baby wipes desitin and the bulb syringe i can move it around and it does not take much space	12
0	a friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter the walker itself is wonderful but the light and sound feature is just the worst as others have said it dies after about 2 months and the battery is non replacable my daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and i ca n't stand it ! if you buy it do n't get it for the music lights they will let you down	12
0	the suctions are pretty weak dont stick well to the tray also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up the arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face when i was able to get the suctions to finally stick as soon as my son would touch it it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face they should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time i took this back the next day i bought the sassy fascination station instead it has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose even i had a hard time pulling it off the tray	12
1	we like this car seat for the price we paid likes love the easily adjustable belts we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately the 5 point harness is great love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers dislikes it does n't recline as much as we 'd like and the head padding is superficial our baby 's head tends to fall forward a lot the sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought it certainly works more than adequately but does n't move easily finally the handle is difficult to move from position to position overall though for the price it 's a good seat	12
0	my hsuband and and decided that i would nurse hailey her entire first year i work at a school and was able to pump twice a day i did n't like doing it in school though because there was n't space for it so i would go in my car and do it all i had a first was the battery pack i would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week i would loose strength suction once i got the adapter i never had a problem again we could go anywhere and i would always have access to power including when we drove from va to ga my husband would drive and i would pump it is great	12
0	we also ordered the bedding and got the pillow we called baby age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding they should know there 's a problem by now and change this listing	12
1	i bought this swing because our first baby had colic reflux and i heard someone else say that the side to side swinging action really calmed their babies colic i thought this baby might be too so we bought this swing no colic this time but she already loves to watch the birds and butterflies turn around the top she follows them around with her eyes very stimulating for the young ones	12
1	every mother father should definitely purchase a baby monitor until this came i could not leave my baby while she slept to go do the dishes and what not the receiver side is battery operated so even if i walk around the house i can here my baby even the smallest sound is picked up ! amazing i have n't tried other monitors but this one is perfect and inexpensive so i would recommend it to anyone	12
1	when we first got the stroller it pulled to the left significantly but we got on the phone with tike tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating the stoller works great now i have taken it running with my two girls it is very stable and drives smoothly	12
1	i read some other reviews that were poor but i disagree my son loves this toy he smiles when he sees the turtle from across his room it plays music continually for 12 minutes so in the middle of the night when he wakes up i turn it on and he 's asleep by the time it runs out we have moved it twice and the straps seemed sturdy however it is recommended that this toy be removed when the child is 5 months old or is able to get on hands and knees this completely contradicts the interactive play mode since the baby needs to be both physically and mentally developed to a stage beyond 5 months to reach all the buttons	12
1	my son is only 2 months old so they are a little large right now i'm sure they will be perfect once he grows into them	12
1	the hello kitty chair was just adorable the quality and craftmanship is outstanding my 15 month old grand daughter crawled right up into it on christmas morning and knew just how to start rocking its just the right size thank yo	12
0	for the first couple of weeks the snack trap worked perfectly after that my daughter \( 7 months old \) figured out how to remove the top \( it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware but easily removed \) and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping throwing or shaking the snacks all around the house on the positive side the flaps for the top are very soft and when she does reach in there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers if only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on then this would work perfectly as it is my daughter loves it but we hate cleaning up the mess	12
1	i bought this w the hippo travel high chair it worked great and kept things cleaner unfortunately it was in the case w the chair when it was stolen out of our truck	12
1	being that we had our baby in december this was a godsend instead of having to bundle her up in heavy clothes thus making it a pain in the neck to strap her into the carseat my wife or i would just clothe the baby normally and not even have to wory about a bulky jacket works great	12
0	i have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and i am not impressed my daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas i experimented with the dr brown bottle and the playtex vent air both seemed to help but the playtex is by far the best people complain about the extra pieces but it is worth it to have a baby who is comfortable	12
1	it works fantastically for the purposes we purchased it ! ! sometimes there is a little interference but if you just move the monitor \( sometimes moving it even just a couple of inches to the left or right will make a difference \) it will work great ! we have had no problems whatsoever and we would definitely buy this monitor again ! ! the night vision works great even in our son 's dark room the color is great as long as there is sufficient light	12
1	my son is now 2 and has been a bottle baby we have atleast 10 different cups and he has always refused them and screamed for his bottle lastnight we bought this terrific cup and he has not asked for the bottle yet ! i will now be putting the bottles away for good this time ! i will be ordering a few more so we always have one on hand they are pricey but if i would n't have bought all the other cups i 'd have had plenty of money saved just by buying these in the first place !	12
1	this seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean i am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads it 's almost porous ! if you get this changing pad plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean	12
0	not much more for us at least we were so excited by the idea of this product and the orange burgandy colors ! but when it come down to it we just could n't ever adjust it comfortably enough for ourselves or the baby we used and liked a hand me down baby bjorn and breast friend sling much better sigh such a waste of a pretty sling	12
1	we are in italy with these huge weird shaped stairways these gates are great and just what we were looking for easy to install easy to use once up they look nice in our house	12
0	the product is flimsy the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine and the seat is too large for a toddler my child does not feel comfortable using this potty	12
1	we registered for this product since it includes so many items necessary for a baby upon receiving it as a shower gift i knew this was going to be great i love the convenient pouch that all the tools and accessories come in it 's small enough to carry around in a diaper bag this is a must have for every new parent	12
1	i bought this pump because it did have a hard plastic breast shield i had a double electric breast pump from first years that was soft plastic shields and i was n't able to get a drop out because the shields did n't stay in place if you have biggre breasts i would suggest using this pump	12
0	the biggest disappointment was that after 6 months the tub began leaking air through an unseen hole maybe in the seams \( thus patch would not work \) kel gar does not warranty the product and the store that the tub came from \( via amazon \) only offered a 90 day warranty also the tub is too wide to fit in a standard tub only half the water from the tub spout lands in tub the rest flows behind it thus wasted water and it takes longer to fill	12
0	decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath but one side does n't seem to want to stick to the walls	12
1	i was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles most of the potties i looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and i didn`t want anything like that this potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn`t have no distracting blings just what the doctor prescribed	12
1	we live in the cold rainy northwest part of the country this product has been essential since our little boy was born in december it has been in his carseat since the day we took him home from the hospital we never need to use blankets or bundle him up in heavy clothes when we take him out in the carseat he stays warm and protected in the bundle me this is definitely the best and most used product we have bought for our baby it is a must for winter babies it is well worth the money	12
1	these are the best pads for the task the ultra thin pads are great for during the day they dont leak and are very breathable the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar try every kind you get samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best	12
0	i was initially very happy with this product we purchased it to transition our 2 year old to a double bed however the plastic hinge bracket broke after several months of use since i liked the product i thought maybe i did n't have it adjusted correctly and bought a second one it too broke so i'm now looking for a sturdier alternative	12
0	i bought this for my son who was just over 2 years old at the time within about 9 or 10 months the railing broke at the plastic hinge obviously since this is major stress point for the product it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue i was disappointed that this railing did not last longer	12
1	i have tried just about every diaper rash cream \( desitin balmex mustela vaseline sprays gold bond powder generic brands etc \) but this is the only brand that truly works the oatmeal or whatever secret ingredient it has gets rid of the redness on my daughter 's bum in usually one or two changes best product	12
1	bought 2 different monitors this one has great features such as the motion sensor auto and scan settings the night vision is weak but daytime looks great better reception than the other video monitor i bought but not having good night vision is a drawback i really bought the video monitors for keeping an eye on my mother who has alzheimers but using the 2 cameras comes in handy for both baby and mom none of these seem to be as quiet as just a regular baby monitor without video but it is very comforting to see and not just hear it is the best one that i 've found on the market	12
1	this chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son 's only high chair i love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair however i bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything i thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair if you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you do n't have a climber this is the chair for you but if you have an escape artist this chair is no better than typical high chairs	12
1	i reccommend this item to anyone using disposable diapers ! i had a generic diaper throw away system it was awful ! this is so easy to use once you get the hang of it and it really keps the smell away ! try it you'l like it	12
0	this is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice i thought ooh what a nifty idea a head bumper ! the whole idea was great but if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine then the head bumper guard is a waste i actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers do n't ask me how he did this the good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib	12
1	this is excellent ! i pump in my car while at work and this is the best idea ever nice long cord allows you to pump in the backseat for privacy a must have	12
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up but i'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !	12
1	we love this seat it is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs or at mother inlaws without a highchair or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair when traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event there are so many uses for this great little seat it is extremely light weight and compact and comes with a carrying bag	12
0	i am so disappointed by another avent product that is just no good short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak my son 's cups have leaked on him on the floor in his diaper bag and in the car i do n't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star mom 's have enough too do running around cleaning after leaky unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the avent magic cup	12
0	i bought this item despite the review that said it was too small big mistake it is small ! it 's not big enough for my 21 months old i'm very dissapointed because i liked the infant version	12
1	i was given a swaddle me for my third child she has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks my oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not i owe it all to the swaddle me but at three months she outgrew the small size i thought she was old enough to go without swaddling boy was i wrong it took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size i have had my large swaddle me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then thank you swaddle me for helping me keep my sanity	12
0	i used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old he woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated the thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin i wo n't ever use it again	12
1	this is great to have if you are going to be on the road and need to pump the long cord was helpful too so you can sit in the backseat and be discrete it was a bit tough to insert into the outlet in my car but i 'm hoping that it gets easier the more i use it	12
0	it worked great for a few days then as i got to the bottom of the batch of wipes they were totally dry also the whole thing flooded my changing table not sure why but i am returning this unit	12
1	i expected a sage or mint to come in the package when i ordered this since it was the vague green used for children but it is lacking i do n't like bright colors so that is not where this is coming from but the color is just not right kiwi is bette	12
1	it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks i have searched the web and ca n't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing does n't look quite as good with a brush that does n't match	12
1	there are a few things that i liked about my simple round about better such as the latch system is more difficult in the decathalon overall though very impressive car seat safety system the fabric for the cover is wonderful and plush and stylish i always feel safe when my little ones are in a britax well worth what may seem like an exorbitant amount of money you cannot put a price on the safety of your child	12
1	we have a very small kitchen so i knew i could never have a large highchair i registered for the healthy chair by fisher price but after putting my son in it once to try it out i returned it for this one and never regretted it this one has a higher back reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable \( the one i have is better than the one shown i bought it at babiesrus \) it actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc 123 plastic mats that go on the tray my son is very comfortable in it and i love that we can take it anywhere	12
1	my two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world it 's so easy to get him to take a bath now ! the crayons are great and come off the tub easily i give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off the compartment to keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open thank you for making this !	12
0	as a nursing mother i researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition i read from so many sources that soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies i bought a starter kit and several other bottles i was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that i purchased only one did not leak i tried repositioning the nipple and i tried to tighten the lid nothing helped my son was soaked everytime we tried to use them i switched to another brand and now we are very dry	12
1	if you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow ! ! ! they are awesome and easy you can wash them they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere love it ! ! !	12
1	my wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old we feed our daughter with bottles \( mix formula with breast milk \) and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref \( my wife did breast bumping \) and mix with formula we use this warmer all the time also when we travel out this one is quite useful generally with only a little small amount of water the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag \( well not compact bag though \)	12
1	this is an excellent product it is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about sids i felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib and that she would n't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats i was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material we even had family members that thought that someone had made the cribshield for us	12
1	i bought this for my twin girls and i love it i had them in september and they fit it in all winter it was so much easier to get the girls out to the car then using winter suits and trying to get twins to wear them or even put them on without screaming using this i was able to just dress them in something less constricting and put them in their car seats before they gave me any hassle once you 're in the car and warm enough all you have to do is unzip the sides and there 's no fuss	12
1	this works great with our chicco capri stroller it took a bit of trial and error to get it in the perfect place so the stroller would close however once i figured that out it was great i could take the accessories off and just put them on when needed the swivel is a great concept i actually wish it came with a third clasp so baby could have a cup holder and snack holder \( one on each side \) and mommy could have her water bottle clip we just switch them out for baby or they hold their sippy by the handles	12
0	and had problems with it from the beginning the cover was ripped where the the plastic clips were attached evenflo did replace it after i sent pictures the shade protector does n't stay up i had a mother stop me in a store and warn me that the handle on hers broke while her husband was carrying her daughter i wish i had checked safety ratings and reviews before i purchased this product	12
1	we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on he would n't use that potty but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it the bjorn is shaped perfectly with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee it 's so comfy that he will sit and read a book ! looks great too simple and easy to clean	12
0	i bought the volo after reading many reviews however it was utter disappointment as soon as i took out the stroller from a box and the carrying strap was off with broken piece of plastic holding piece yes the stroller is light and very very flimsy i returned it right away	12
1	i buy a lot of stuff from amazon this bath tub is a good purchase but as soon as i bought it the price reduced on amazon this had been a constant problem on amazon and i think somebody should do something about it i think i should get a refund \) thanks shobhn	12
1	i got one of these for my baby shower i loved it so much i went back and bought another one very easy to use i just put my baby in it before she 's going to sleep for the night there is no need for blankets when using the sleepsack puts your mind at ease no loose blankets in the crib ! ! also reccomend getting the thinner cotton one for the warmer nights	12
0	i bought these after we moved because our new house had knobs on the front instead of on the counter surface they fit my oven knobs very loosely so my son likes to make them spin around and around also a few of my knobs pull off easily my son just grabs hold of the covers and off they come both knob and cover then it 's a neat toy with the knob rattling around inside the cover they do keep him from turning on the stove so they do what their suppose to i'm just not sure if it 's worth it it probably depends on your stove	12
0	these bottles leak after a few months and it 's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle you almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak	12
0	i bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it doesn't fit at all ! if you are using just for home sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but do n't get it for travel as it does n't work for that	12
0	the thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper but it is very blunt ! ! ! and the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible unless baby 's nail is very very long if i wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing my 3 month old would have scratched his face and head i end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy that worked much better	12
1	my little guy loved this from the start this is a versatile toy that lasted many months the mat is machine washable so it became our take along for travel the hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows he 's now 2 yrs and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room ! this was a great investment	12
0	i 've contacted the manufacturer for an alternative way to hook to crib they were less than helpful i am thinking about returning the entire set i'm so disappointed	12
0	every single time the reading is way low around 94 9 or something like that it is extremely unreliable do n't waste your money	12
0	very useless pants i bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and i did buy the correct size they even leaked when used over diapers at night they bascially do nothing	12
0	after spending over 30 for this item we used it only twice and it ripped on the bottom clear across a seamstress said it could not be repaired and commented that the fabric was not very durable or strong would not purchase again or recommend to others	12
1	to bring the co sleeper up to the height of the bed these leg extensions are the best bet yes as someone else said they do make it a little shaky so if you are not planning to attach the co sleeper to your bed you may want to leave the height alone \( you 'll be getting up anyway so it probably does n't matter how tall it is \) but once attached to the bed with the anchor strap rather than free standing it was very secure	12
1	i had this highchair delivered to my new great grandaughter so i am reporting what they said about it great	12
0	the screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately was about to use my own then read the review below and decided i 'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall	12
1	we finally broke down and spent the money on the jumperoo and were happy we did we have to limit the time our son spends in it because he 'd jump for hours on end if we did n't limit him to 5 10 minutes a day the jumperoo has sturdy construction and the 4 settings are useful i was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because i was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it but he 's been fine he does n't play with the toy attachment i think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	12
1	i love this simply designed sturdy potty my son loves it which is most important he has no trouble sitting down on it no pinching no crampedness no tipping over the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over ! having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books ! great product great price i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother 's	12
1	this is a great walker the tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger my grandson just loves the walker and i do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely amazon sells model 14570 so do n't worry the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary also a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk	12
1	i got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it ! this playpen is so wonderful very colorful sooo easy to set it up i'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it i received great reviews on this gear also so do n't be dissapointed to grab one like it ! ! ! awesome playpen ! !	12
1	i was really nervous about this product after reading the reviews but once i put the organizer up it was great i use the top four slots for thing like mittens and cotton balls and the next two for wipes and larger lotion and bath items the bottom is really good for several diapers i love it ! ! !	12
0	i 've bought this tub thinking that i can just fold it up and store it under the sink but that 's not how it works it take many steps to fold and unfold it one of them ivolves inflating the seat ! the mechanism for snapping it in place when it 's unfolded looks like it would break if it was used a couple of times also the plastic inflatable seat smells like all of the plastic inflatable things probably not very pleasant for a little baby i am returning this item	12
0	nine days from mn to pa seems too long perhaps target direct got process problems i am not satisified got the same three pack of bottles which i bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local cvs for 1 50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it	12
0	i though it was just me but after reading several other reviews i see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble disassemble the locks are impossible the items do not quite fit right and it would be impossible to get this thing into its travel bag the mattress is thin and very lumpy each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps i bought this product thinking i could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co sleeper aspect but there is no way i recommend you avoid this product !	12
0	we ordered one it did n't work well it seemed great but it was a bear to fold when there was a little bit of wind based on all the reviews we thought we must have had a defective one we ordered a replacement but it seems to have the same issues very disappointed	12
0	i was looking for something portable and to keep the baby close by i tried it out with a baby doll first and i ended up covering the snuggle nest with my blankets in the middle of the night	12
0	do not purchase this product if you plan to use your play yard with the bassinet the tent snaps on in the same spot and you can not use both	12
1	surprisingly its been hard to find a two compartment dish for baby food this one works great and comes with a nice spoon that fits on top of the dish for storage it is a great size and lightweight for taking in the diaper bag for eating out too	12
1	my daughter was the most happy when she was in her halo i love these sleep blankets the cotton ones for use in florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece i wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits i recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers	12
0	i just received this product after much research and i am really disappointed with it 's quality the mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby and the sheets provided are like an emory board scratchy and stiff my baby is too long for this so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres i just thought it would be much better than this looks like i will be returning it my daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce	12
0	i bought this item on my own because i read the wonderful reviews it received i really do n't know how this item can be used even if you do n't use the air vented cups \( which collect the leaking milk \) you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing i was wearing a sweater you could see the shape of the shells right through it if you do use the cups they supply you look absolutely abnormal i guess this does n't work for large breasted women	12
0	this machine is not loud enough i have 2 machines this one that is in the babies room and a different machine \( made by lifewise \) in my boys room my boys sleep through anything the dog the door bell whatever it is but this machine just does n't cut it unless you live in a sound proof house	12
1	my son loves these blocks we 've also purchased the number blocks to go along with this set he loves saying the colors numbers and stacking them	12
0	i have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it did not work the bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed my friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better	12
1	we 've used this since my daughter was about 7 1 2 months old she 's now 2 1 2 and we 've never had any problems with it this is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall park etc the sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too we 've never used the rain cover so i ca n't comment on that it does n't have a storage basket but i do n't know many umbrella strollers that do for longer trips we just take our full size combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option i would definitely recommend this stroller for a light quick outing stroller to keep in the car	12
1	the original nursers enabled me to return to work after a long maternity leave my baby would n't take the bottle until i introduced the brown rubber nipple thanks mom	12
1	i had one of these with my second son and loved it we just kept it in his car seat and it made it so easy to cover him up when necessary when it was hot out we could uncover him and when we went into somewhere with air conditioning we would just cover him up it is soft and cozy we found it so convenient we will be purchasing another one for number three who 's due in may	12
0	i have had nothing but problems with this company i was missing bolts for an item i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty took care of that but still waiting on bolts order the piece in december it is now april and still not able to assemble	12
1	after using a smaller plastic tub and a blow up tub this one is the best ! i only wish i would 've just bought this one to begin with my little guy is 6 months old 24 pounds but ca n't sit up yet he still uses the side that lays him down in the water and he loves it ! do n't waste your money on other tubs this one is the best this one will grow with your child while saving water too	12

0	i bought this pump the day i was discharged from the hospital \( 12 11 05 \) i have used it on a part time basis since i am staying home and nurse directly however the motor broke and could n't pump anymore my baby is only 5 months and this pump already broke i have only used it during nights to keep a storage for my baby i was lucky to call medela on time since this pump is still under its 6 month warranty period so i could get my money back	12
1	i purchased the sesame beginnings walker and my daughter loves it there is a mirror in the middle of the toy bar and she loves to look at herself it also has big bird and cookie monster figures on each end and she loves to play with them this walker makes noise and lights up there is n't any paint on her walker and i do n't know what the other writer was referring to but this walker is very safe and enjoyable for my daughter	12
0	do not buy this or any item from baby age their customer service is horrible amazon should remove all of their listings	12
0	it made my breasts look funny it made my nipples more irritable it left painful marks on my breasts hardly ever used it	12
1	i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help \( after she was diagnosed we were given zantac but still used this as well ! \) it 's a true godsend we 'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto she was content ! ! ! this works far better than mylicon it is expensive but it is completely worth the price we called it 'liquid gold' in our house	12
1	i love this bumper it is n't thick like the padded bumpers and fits the crib nicely without bunching and the price is much more reasonable than the bumpers that go with bedding sets mostly i can feel secure that my little one is safe even if he rolls up to the edge of the railings i know his arms and legs wo n't get tangled in the railings but he also can breathe great product it is cute too and looks very nice on a white crib	12
0	this did not work for us at all i found that i could n't get it wrapped around our newborn without her kicking it off if you know how to swaddle then use the hospital blanket or another thin blanket made of cotton	12
0	besides the fact that the straps where n't long enough to hold on to my son crib it ended up on the floor every other day ! ! ! save your money and do n't buy it ! ! !	12
1	if you 're going to get the baby bjorn potty chair you 've got to get a matching stool ! i love how the stool has a rubbery grip top to prevent slipping my son also uses the stool to read his books on while sitting in his matching potty chair you 've gotta get one now	12
1	i got this hat because it matched the jj cole bundle me blanket for my son 's car seat he looks absolutely adorable in it but he hates wearing it unfortunately the elastic is a little bit tight and it smooshes his whole forehead down overall if your baby is a hat wearer and this fits him her then it 's wonderful it 's warm soft and is made very well	12
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet it seems that first years has discontinued the product at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website we searched for model 4290 the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer apparently they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued furthermore the site is full of broken image links the thermometer works well but without probe covers it 's not a good investment you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there find another product with covers available	12
0	my baby slid both down and off the side of this i thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base rather it acted as a swivel and i found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner i am involved in a sids research study and this product alarms me ! she could have suffocated ! i am trying to contact the company to report this item please do not buy	12
0	i ca n't begin to convey the frustration i felt when trying to use the refill i struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too tight bag over the cartridge the diaper dekor works wonderfully as a single use item but at about 30 40 a pop it is the most expensive garbage can outside of ted kozolowski 's apartment the printed instructions were clear it 's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do	12
1	we got this when our baby was about 6 months old he is now 9 months at first he was n't sure what to do but once he figured out how to jump in it it was all he wanted to do the adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it it 's a little awkward to move around but the enjoyment well out weighs that	12
0	a great idea but very time consuming to put on my advice is to use a regular maya type sling for the first few months and then get the patapum it 's the least pricey of the structured carriers which are the only ones that put the weight on your hips rather than your shoulders and therefore spare your spine	12
0	in order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy you need it to be digital and use digital spread spectrum \( dss \) technology 900 mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor though here 's why it is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2 4 ghz devices this includes baby monitors and cordless telephones the correct arrangement should be baby monitor 900 mhz digital spread spectrum \( dss \) wifi netowrk 2 4 ghzcordless telephone 5 8 ghz digital spread spectrum \( dss	12
1	my son loves this jumper it gives him a sense of independence he likes to rock from one leg to the other and then he spins completely around	12
1	this is such a great idea i just leave mine in my diaper bag so if we end up somewhere without a clean bib we can make our own	12
1	i have always had graco infant seats for my children i got this one for baby number 4 and love it it is so cute ! and the cover is just wonderful for the fall and winter months also i love the color of it	12
1	i purchased the extention kit for the superyard xt play gate to go with the play gate that i purchased it works great for my new pomeranian puppies the play yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe it will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves the fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so i can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be i love this item and i am very happy i purchased it i feel the gate is great for animals i have not used it with children as of this time	12
0	only the top 1 4 of the wipes are warm if you do n't refill the container continously wipes get cold plus you might consider the ease of use with a pop up warmer	12
1	that 's just it i love this product and i am so happy that we purchased it it saves time and space and is very safe for my children we bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful	12
0	this sling was very difficult to use i could never get it adjusted correctly and never figured out how to breastfeed in it without being obvious i used this sling for about 6 weeks and it just about killed my shoulder and back it was uncomfortable and not nearly enough padding in the shoulders plus you still had to carry a diaper bag and or purse so that just added extra weight do n't waste the money i would much rather have another front back carrier they work so much better and are easier to use and feel a lot safer the only things i did like were the pockets on the strap to keep small things in like paci 's keys money and cell	12
1	lightweight high quality construction we are very pleased with it and our 1 5yr girl just loves it the carrying strap is a very convenient addition do n't waste your money on a 20 umbrella stroller spend a little more and enjoy the high quality of this excellent stroller	12
1	this is a great price for a 4 pc set \( i got ours at walmart for 35 \) the comforter is not thick and plushy its very thin and stiff but then again for the price its ok the sheets are adorable we bought a very soft fuzzy dora blanket to go with it but the comforter that comes with it is definately cute maybe after a few washes it will soften up some i would still buy it again for the price but if you are looking for a thick soft warm comfoter then this is not the one you want	12
0	this sheet is cheap ugly and scratchy instead buy a portable crib sheet they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors they are softer and more durable	12
0	my experience has been similar to that of other reviewers the one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro my two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when i checked her in the middle of the night honestly the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they did n't move their arms so perhaps the designers had no children of their own	12
0	the item is sloppy looking and feeling unlike the photo of the black ellaroo i did n't feel that the baby was secure and she rode so low on my side that one could hardly call it a hip maybe i just never got it adjusted correctly but i read the instructions and gave it many tries however on a positive note i was refunded my money with no problem there was a small restock fee which was disclosed up front so i have no problem with the seller	12
1	i love this car seat stroller it goes from car to airplane in no time flat great if you travel with small children with just one adult also great if running errands and your child falls asleep no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car however the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it i still love this product	12
1	like any parent i was concerned about sids so the sleepsack seemed like the perfect alternative to blankets little did i know i would come to love the sleepsack for it 's warming capabilities after a few months under their belt babies get very squirmy in the middle of the night so blankets are useless \( and dangerous \) so i relied heavily on the sleepsacks to keep my little guy warm even after the risk of sids passed they come in fleece for winter months and cotton for warmer months and they 're generous in size so they are not outgrown easily i only wish i 'd purchased them in yellow or white in case my next baby is the opposite sex	12
1	this is an excellent game people who love this type of game will be impressed great graphics really a step up from the years past i would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in playingt this style of game	13
1	this game is simply awesome i received it for a gift last christmas and i still love it the graphics action are amazing it 's not available on xbox if you do n't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece you 'll love it the main character kratos reminds me of quan chi in mortal kombat looking forward to god of war 2	13
1	this is an unorthodox football game this is not an nfl game but a football game w made up teams in a made up league there are 3 divisions and you start at the bottom beat the division 3 level move up to 2 beat 2 to go to 1 beat 1 to beat the game as you move up you also unlock rewards if you 're tired of madden 's franchise mode give this game a try it wo n't get outdated just because of nfl free agency	13
1	i got this game for my kids one is 11 and one is 9 they love it they can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it like baseball soccer boxing etc hey this even come with the camera i rated 4 stars because of the graffics they are not the best but still acceptible hope this review helps	13
1	basically if you like 04 05 and 06 you will like this game as nothing but the rankings really has changed its the same commentary gameplay and a few new graphics i like it as its a lot of fun im glad they didnt change it remember the old saying if it aint broke dont fix it this is a great game to play and as close to being there as you can ge	13
0	i bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a usb flash drive i have not been able to get either to work correctly after following their instructions on the datel website on how to update the codes using a usb drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card it also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 i have had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow and does n't live up to the promises their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves ! !	13
1	hi tried ordering g2 gold edition online but it wo n't let me and the retailers here do n't have it in their data even so my only options are to get somweone i know in the states to get it for me or to go there myself and try to get it gothic 2 gold edition night of the raven thats the one email me anyone who knows how to get this to me here in victoria bc alan johnson chumtv com or alj2663 hotmail comthanks a bunc	13
0	both this game and danger by design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games \( shadow ranch the last train to blue moon canyon secret of the old clock etc \) the game was short and i thought the tasks were a bit dull i also found it somewhat confusing switching between nancy drew and the hardy boys hopefully her interactive will produce something better next time because these games really are addictive even for adults	13
1	in the april 2005 pc gamer magazine it showed the top 50 computer games of all time half life was 1 this is basically a sequel to that game very fun except when you 're in a server with hackers in it just make sure to never give your cd key out and to go to steampowered com and download steam to play it \( for version 1 6 \) then go to browse games and register your cd key once you do that you wo n't be getting as much sleep as you had the past few years	13
1	needs more shoulder buttons other than that is good	13
1	i'm going to keep this short because the game does n't deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and short my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it	13
1	this product is excellent has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time good perfromanc	13
1	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
0	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
0	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
1	this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta \( grand theft auto \) seriesgraphics 9 10sound 8 10gameplay 7 5 10overall 8 3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever	13
1	i just recently bought this game for about 10 dollars i had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox \( i 've been a ps2 fan for a while \) after i played the first couple of levels i was not dissapointed this game is simply amazing even today i ca n't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out the gameplay is terrific and so are the graphics the sound and music to the game is awsome i highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning	13
1	i would recommend this to those who just wants more than just shooting at fat ass people or aliens just slobbering on cra	13
1	this games story takes place before gta 3 so it 's sort of like a prequal set in liberty city compared to the original it looks a lot better plus they added bikes and motor cycles and attempted to improve the targeting by using the targeting system from san andreas i hate the targeting but being able target manually is a good thing if you do n't own a psp i 'd suggest getting this game but if you do and played it on that system there really is n't any point to buying this game unless you really really love gta	13
1	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
0	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13
0	do n't buy it unless you want the starforce malware on your computer i understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers i need \( ed \) for my dvd burner check the search engines and see for yourself would have otherwise been a great game too bad it is n't playable because of this malware	13
0	do n't buy this here it is selling for 49 99 at best buy \( bestbuy com \) wait until they lower the price on amazon	13
0	i have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on this action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in avoid like the plague	13
1	this game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious you will need a lot of patience to play it	13
1	this is a fun game to play i am on the 2nd mystery to solve i do love these types of games this one is sort of like trace memory alot of reading to do in it i am an adult woman my 11yr old son says it doesnt think he would want to play it though	13
1	this is a very interesting game lots of places to explore game play is pretty smooth sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot the game is very bookish with no cut scenes from the movie it can be fairly complicated at times with some strange moves to master like flying shoes and umbrellas it 's a fun game with good graphics	13
1	will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both	13
1	this is the kit not just a card a previous review indicated that bestbuy com was selling this for 49 99 that is not correct they are selling the card for 49 99 this kit comes with the card plus several other components thus making it 20 more you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere but not significantly it does what it intends to do	13
1	for anyone who loves football and everything about it knows their is also a dark side of the game where players take illegal drugs to help out their game where owners will do anything for their team to win this game is alot like any given sunday remember win at any cos	13

1	i bought 2 of these controllers for my kids because i did n't want cables in the middle of our family room nor did i want them sitting too close to the tv when they played this controllers are excellent they work perfectly they are easy to store because of the lack of cables the weight is fine for small children the range of the signal is more than enough and they are n't battery eaters i use them as well and they are wonderful they are much better than the ones that comes with the playstations	13
0	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
1	i love this game i have n't played other ddr games before so i'm not sure how it compares to others but this one is great some of the songs i like a lot and some i do n't but they 're all a challenge and fun in some way i like to use the dance master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well i have n't made it all that far because i play the same levels over and over again because they 're so fun this game is great for people of all ages and includes music for the young and old	13
1	i 've only had this controller for a few days and i have found that the layout is the same as the black controller i do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game	13
1	i 've never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game a number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in railroads as compared to rrt3 which is absolutely correct if you are seeking a complex simulation railroads is not the game for you if however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads it is one of my favorite games of all time	13
1	this was a top notch game i really enjoyed playing it it was a well designed thoroughly enjoyable shooter the good looking girl calling you cowboy all the time was a bit silly \( especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time i was \) if you 've already played halo and you 're looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one	13
1	they 're nice cards i never had a problem since i had 3 ps2s in my house at the time we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine then my boyfriend bought me these and i always had my own memory cards no one else could say they were theirs or anything else the only problem i can think of is that they are a little expensive	13
0	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	13
1	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13
0	i dont have much to say other than i did not like this game i was hoping that it was going to be like fusion frenzy for the xbox but it was not nearly as fun the controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good some people may like it but i did n't	13
1	beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the valkyrie epic the storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists valkyrie profile 2 is one of the last best games that will ever hit the ps2 making it a must buy on a personal note this game made me want to play the original again before starting it so i highly recommend playing vp1 through before starting vp2	13
1	you can read that the eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but i just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your pc by just plugging it into your computer 's usb port	13
0	such great visuals and i love most of the star wars rpg shooters but i cant believe this is a point and click game i was hoping kotor2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill the days of boulder 's gate point n click should be over but i guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay still a good game but dissapointed	13
1	star wars kotor 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good rpg 's it starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game i felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	13
1	for newcomers to the saga jumping on board at this point in time may not be worth it however if you 've already been sucked in by the first two you should find this to be quite enjoyable a few changes and simplifications to the battle system will make battle less of a chore the story line of course is stillthe main focus ofthe game so if you 've been dying to see what happens next to our beloved crew this game will give it to you i however do not recommend this game for those who enjoy gameplay over story line	13
1	my son loves this controller it fits well in his hands and has a similar feel to the regular corded ps2 sony controller it does n't have the same rumble feature but has a button to turn the rumble feature on and off overall it 's the best cordless that he 's used yet	13
1	a lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good but it is my favorite game to play on the wii doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun and you get bonus points for ramming your opponents if it were only like that on real roads	13
0	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	13
0	small memory which means that u can only put 1 save on it so u have to run back to your comp everytime u wanna save ! ! ! and software is veery confusing ! ! ! horrible buy ! ! ! i returned the piece of junk ! !	13
1	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
1	i love this thing it 's awesome the older version of ds was a little clunky and childish looking this thing rocks my socks off ! it 's sleek sexy and portable it 's like an ipod of video games you do n't have to buy batteries it comes with an extra stylus its screen is brighter the sound is stereo ! this thing is super dope ! it 's the freshest thing out there ! you gotta get one sell your old ds on here on amazon and put the money toward the new one you 'll love it	13
0	this is the worst item you can get for your 360 i got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360 it was crashing and freezing and ultimately i had to get my console repaired do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby \( 360 \)	13
1	the game has a lot of plot development and cutscenes if you are into it then that 's great i find i scan for the gist and then move on to the next dialogue that being said all of the backgrounds are simply the best ever put on screen i find myself actually commenting aloud to myself how beautiful the game is the action is good and the plot does suck you in nothing novel in the battle system while the plot managed to surprise me after playing both of it 's predecessors completely worth your while	13
1	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
1	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
0	i purchased this game when it was new and my computer while meeting the requirements just could n't run it i put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again the computer i have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work i contacted tech support and got what i am now sure are just something for me to try until i quit trying and leave them alone it worked they win they got my money and i got jack	13
0	as far as i am concerned this game is total garbage and i would not recomend it to any one i do not know why it was ever released ! ! deer hunter 2003 is the same way i tossed both of them in the garbage trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story the game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers	13
1	the introduction isn't boring it isn't long and it is one of the best introductions to a game made by enix se if you do n't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 ! ! ! 1 then do n't buy another rpg for as long as you live rpgs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different if you do n't like it take it back and get a refund do n't play rpg 's like this if you ca n't stand words go play some gta or something oh wait theres words in that too	13
0	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
1	i 've been playing mario games since the original debut on the nes and am extremely happy with my purchase of this game the rpg style is a great offshoot for the mario franchise the dialogue animations and surprises are hilarious and the 30 hours i spent playing the game were well worth it there 's a large amount of replayability as there are tons of badges and shine sprites to find i will agree with a previous review about the frustration of not being able to skip cut scenes most of it is the pain of having to tab through tons of dialogue which can grow tiresome if you get stuck at a certain point and have to consistently watch the same section over and over	13
1	i bought a nintendo ds so i can play super mario brothers for ever like i was when i was a kid its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger my 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and i had to buy him a ds along with mario so he could play it after i left to go back home	13
1	i am using brainage game with this very challenging and i have improved my performance	13
0	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	13
0	this one turned out badly and i hate to say i bought it buggy worse than normal it is a rough game the fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible the support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions too bad i trusted pc gamer 's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game	13
0	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13
0	this game is really bad i mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money i gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam	13
0	this game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people	13
0	tediously long and weary nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from rtcw hl2 etc i am sick of this	13
1	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
1	i bought this game for an adult birthday party it was a hit the game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game you have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc you can also change the mode to the traditional karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen it 's definitely for all ages even my two year old ca n't get enough of it the selection of music is good be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes	13
0	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	13
1	if you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game it is as if you are the star of the film but that also means that there are many cut scenes these cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic but there are those of you out there that do n't liek cut scenes at all if this is the case for you reader do n't buy this game if you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you ca n't go wrong with this game i have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price it is that good if you like cut scenes	13
0	i purchased this remote control to make watching dvd 's on the ps2 easier i had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box i had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work i hoped it would get better but it only got worse i am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away i would never recommend this product	13
0	i waited months for this game to come out i ca n't add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever	13
1	this is a nice package of my two favorite final fantasy games final fantasy vi and final fantasy v final fantasy v has never seen release here and i feel that the translation was both well done and sensitive to the original japanese version final fantasy vi has been restored to its original glory in this version and it 's a nice change to see uncensored graphics and the original final fantasy vi title with tina \( terra \) in magitek armor i highly recommend this collection	13
1	this game is so creative it 's really atypical and really exciting	13
0	i love the idea behind this game and it 's pretty impressively exectuted i had three gripes though 1 \) it 's so fast paced that i found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 \) i could n't get the magnify and reduce \( with quick little circles \) to work this caused me great frustration 3 \) there 's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times i quit playing it pretty quickly	13
1	the memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great no read errors very noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it	13
1	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	13
0	i was really excited when i saw this item was out ! i had the commodore 64 when i was a kid and my brother and i used to spend hours and hours playing games on it i was so glad to see that winter games and summer games was included until the item arrived and i plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick does n't work at all when you move it to the right so you can only use it to go up down or left big dissapointment do n't waste your	13
0	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
1	your back in liberty city \( just like gta 3 \) you cant fly swim clime \( just like gta 3 \) no graphics upgrade no airplanes glitches like crazy same as psp but if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the intresting funny good story line than get this 20 bucks cant go wrong	13
1	i 've done most of the nancy drew games now and a couple csi and law and order games nancy drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than csi i also had so many problems with bugs with the csi and law and order games not so with nancy drew and a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	13
0	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
0	this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy does n't respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just do n't play the pc version borrow someone 's xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	13
0	at first when i got it it seemed fun then as the minutes go by it got boring quick the missions suck the bosses are too hard i just sold my game if you buy this game you 'll be doing the sam	13
1	this is a wonderful gift for any girl gamer i love mine	13
1	when i started playing this game it was hard for me to stop i play it every chance i get and the best thing about it i got it for far less money from amazon com	13
1	just so everyone knows i mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who would n't be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind and do n't even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this	13
0	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	13
0	ok most people have more then one system i have a ps2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the ps2 \? some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don	13
1	i love this game once i started playing i could n't stop my ds battery is dead after like 3 days i play so much once you get into the game it is really hard to stop playing you get new moves and new weapons thus making the game new all the time the controls are easy to learn and the story is easy to get into so lets all tip our hats to nintendo and all there mario greatness	13
1	nothing bad to mention it this control is the original works very well good price	13
1	the memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great no read errors very noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it	13
1	i 've played them all and enjoyed them all sorry this was the last one	13
0	this is supposed to be an x box cleaner but the system does not read the disc a shoddy product	13
1	this game is really good but i do n't think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long so if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game	13
1	at first playing a star wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks ! ! ! ! ! this game is incredible ! ! ! it is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it buy this game and put your blasters on full	13
1	wow that 's all i can say all the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game' just got it a few days ago and am so impressed with all that 's packed into it ! ! ! it also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises this is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen people of all fitness levels can enjoy this this technology \( interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts \) has got to be the wave of the future ! !	13
1	you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e reader to download e reader information into your cub	13
1	this game is very good they only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool the game folows the movies well you can even blow up buildings the only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave lastly you can get in high speed cases with the cops	13
0	i bought this for my xbox 360 and it does n't work at all which is a good thing considering the other reviews i 've read here at least by not working it is n't damaging my xbox 360	13
1	this games is just great i found funny to play everything in it almost like in the game the controls are very easy the graphics are quite nice and the music too great choice	13
0	the review by bovey is spot on ! these games have gotten more boring as they go the majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough \? there was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom ! and the game was so short suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed in what these games have become i loved the final scene i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough this game was just lame i do n't recommend paying full price for it	13
1	it works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original a v cables	13
1	i am 23 years old and this game has n't left my ds since i bought it a month ago it 's incredibly fun i would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames you get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking i love these weird japanese games ! i only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes i heard they are making a wii version of cooking mama so i'm hoping that one will have more recipes	13
0	i brought this after having played caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and i thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension wrong this is a bad rip off of caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that i was playing the same game but with less involvement or control this is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they 'll stay caesar iv that 's what you 're wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it is n't feel like i 've wasted my money	13
1	it works great great quality great sound and especially great color detail only thing that sucks is actually getting the cables into the tv plugs it 's horrible on most tv 's i 've seen with component plugs the plugs are are built very close together and each of the component ends \( blue green red \) where the cap kind of goes over actual thing you put in \( the usually gold plated thing \) are almost too big so you ca n't fully plug in all 5 of them \( 3 video 2 audio \) but just kinda have to push em in just enough so that it actually works other than that the quality and everything is fantasti	13
1	this was a present for my brother so i do n't know what it was like but he said it is the best 3rd person game on the x box	13
1	i love this game for what it is you cannot expect this to be anything like madden but it is still a fun game injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced fast paced something i cannot say about the loading this game is the slowest loading game i have ever played it actually took three minutes for it to load one time get this game provided that you can wait a little bit	13
1	i used a linksys media center extender to play and view my music and picture collection through my home theater this product completley replaced the need for the extender was extremely easy to setup \( wep enabled \) and works flawlessly i do not find it overpriced at all given the capabilities for games and interacting with a media center pc the music streaming is every bit as good setup was as simple as plugging in the adapter and entering the security code well done microsoft ! tom las vega	13
1	the best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars ! ! if you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the internet then this is where the fun really begins ! these secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank \( this is only listing a few \) ! as always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old	13
1	my just turned 6 year old can figure out 70 of the logic needed in this game he ca n't do a very few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy i had to finally defeat for him but he really likes this game he gets the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters it has a tad more killing of stuff than i care for but what does n't these days he likes being able to be different characters his favorite is puss n boots ! as a grown up i enjoyed it as well especially the humor	13
1	i 've read in some other websites that this are gonna be compatible with the ps3 since the ps3 originally only comes with the traditional wires \( av cables \) im wondering if this cables can deliver an hd signal \( hd pic quality \) or im just gonna have to spend some extra bucks in the hdmi cable since i alredy have this component ones	13
1	i'm so glad i listened to the fine reviewers on amazon and bought this game it was worth every penny and then some ! ! it has a lot of really great game play and i love how the babies are used in conjunction with the adults to accomplish various tasks i feel like the game play is also very natural for the characters you would n't feel right about mario and luigi casting spells like the characters from final fantasy but it 's perfect to have them jumping and smashing with hammers and flinging turtle shells and as weird as that sounds it makes for a great rpg lots of good side missions too like collecting the beans wonderful game !	13
1	this is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game you get over 20 different vehicles and guns the tv like gameplay makes for a good story line there 's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first ps2 games gran theft auto 50 driv3r 30 starsky and hutch priceless	13
1	many games my kids have are n't actually geared towards kids this game is perfect for children it 's fun without being too hard or easy my children are 6 and 8 years old and can be challenged and entertained i highly recommend this as a great family game many games we can take turns playing	13
1	we got a group of 5 friends together to do guitar hero 1 and 2 ddr and now karaoke revolution party it 's freaking cool the songs list is very good and there 's something for everyone easy to figure out too	13
1	as you can imagine having 2 separate cards for saving games and info is perfect ! by the way the seller was beyond awesome hope you can get yours from the same !	13
1	my husband brought this game home and i thought oh no i guess we 're not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks but to my surprise not only did he absolutely love this game but i would sit next to him and watch totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game i caught myself saying baby are n't you going to play your game \? this game is incredible and while i am not at all a gamer i'm tempted to try it out ! everyone not shocked by gore \( and i mean lots of gore \) should play this game every game should be this well made	13
1	i 've never played real time strategy games before because i primarily play rpg 's this game combines the best elements of both and i 've enjoyed playing it immensly i look forward to playing part 2 after completing it a couple more times with different characters	13
1	in terms of overall quality this game is light years better than tekken 4 the graphics are terrific the gameplay has improved dramatically and they got rid of that annoying position change feature i especially love the customization feature my only problem is playing against jinpachi who usually takes me about 15 tries before getting a lucky shot to beat him other than that this game is terrific	13
0	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	13
0	when i bought the xbox on 6 11 06 it came at a very good rate of time my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke i do n't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months i ca n't say the person that sold me the xbox has even tried to email me since i 've emailed him hmmmm	13
1	if you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a ps2 i would recommend this video game	13
1	hi i am 11 yrs old and my next door neighboor 's little sister got a pink nintendo lite she is 6 yrs old and she recieved it for her birthday with the nintendo ds lite she recieved cooking mama i started to play it and it was really fun ! it is fun to get new recipies and prepare the food my favorite is making the pizza and beef stew	13
1	this game was a lot of fun the microphone headset works great the only downside is i wish it had more songs but i guess that is what sequals are for overall a good product fun to play with friends or family or even by yourself	13
1	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	13
0	i honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms 4 came out it actually now has a use let me explain unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing \( the company that translated wild arms 4 \) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you 'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this if it was n't for this reason i would n't even be interested in this product	13
0	i thougt there would be a better story line and what i found was very disappointing the boss \( mcgruder \) was easier to beat than the boss in the matrix path to neo i mean i paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously i was wrong	13
1	i'm enjoying the game it was in perfect condition when i received it i have n't had the chance to play as much as i 'd like but i will	13
1	i liked this game i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok	13
0	i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here 's an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children 's word game book i easily got all of them except 1 meaning i could n't progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i did n't want to ! i'm not saying it 's a bad game it 's just probably not a good game for grownups	13
0	then this will not work on your console but if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console if you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark	13
1	my son has had many happy hours with this game it came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy	13
0	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
0	the games faults have been well covered already so i 'll just say if a roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for ceasar iv afer playing the demo i can say that this will be a far superior game than civcity on every level it seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably	13
1	so if it 's such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating \? well it 's a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating and it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me they physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so but everything else is great about it graphics are great not excellent but great sound is great too gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed kinda on the easy side in normal level though but i guess nothing is perfect go ahead and get this one it 's worth what it costs	13
1	this is the best jak game in the series the handling of the wasteland vehicles is spectaculur the game is not easy which is good graphics are good as well if you are a fan of ratchet and clank get this game overall i give this game a perfect 10	13
1	pros exciting and absorbing story line great gaming experience cons some minor bugs single player game cannot replay more than a few times	13
1	this game is alot like call of duty 2 the graphics are better than 2 the play is almost the same the online play is where the game thrives the online play is better than 2 you get to refine your choice of game if you love shooters you will love this game	13
0	at first when i got it it seemed fun then as the minutes go by it got boring quick the missions suck the bosses are too hard i just sold my game if you buy this game you 'll be doing the sam	13
1	i will keep this review short the game is a very addictive entertaining rpg great story great gameplay best game i played all year only thing that it was lacking was a lock on feature for enemies took me about 45 hours to complete the main story and almost all of the side missions if you buy this game you will play it to the end	13
1	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
1	dude supy gave this game a bad review supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games it is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the lemony snicket movie the game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you 're not a very skilled gamer \( like my 6 year old \) it 's okay because if you die you just restart the task i have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating	13
0	i thougt there would be a better story line and what i found was very disappointing the boss \( mcgruder \) was easier to beat than the boss in the matrix path to neo i mean i paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously i was wrong	13
1	i have all the grand theft games and this is one of my favs i highly recommend it and all the others i recently purchased liberty city awesome	13
0	returned item for refund found it cheaper at toys r u	13
1	i bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing i didn't have any idea that it would be so fun that the whole family would join in and play for hours ! it was so fun that we immediately had to buy the kareoke cmt country game also	13
1	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
0	i bought this mic in december and after only two nights of singing it completely died ! what a complete disappointment save your money !	13
1	i 'll admit i was a little skeptical about this game as it turns out this game rocks ! arena football fans do not pass this one up ! hopefully when they make the sequel \( yeah i said sequel \) they will include the new afl2 teams tennessee valley vipers rule	13
1	when i heard that square was going to remake final fantasy iv \( originally final fantasy ii in the u s \) i was very excited this game is considered to be one of the greatest final fantasy games of all time all in all i would recomend this game to anyone who is a final fantasy fan	13
0	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
1	this game is a lot of fun the level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music is n't as good in this newest version but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days	13
0	this pack offered very little of anything the decor \( very little of it \) is uninspired i was hoping to get some good artwork at least i know a lot of people do n't like to download from fan sites but do n't waste your money on this junk believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did this is the first and last stuff pack that i will ever buy	13
0	dvd 's which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or do n't play when i try to play them on the xbox do n't waste your money on this buy a stand alone dvd player instead so you wo n't have the frustration that i 've had	13
1	i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin	13
1	my son loves this game ! we rented it first from blockbuster and now he wo n't let us take it back so i ordered it from amazon com so i can take the game back soon to blockbuster ! i have to help him through some of the areas like when the penguin is fishing but i do n't mind because it 's fun	13
1	i do not own the headset yet but i have already ordered it from amazon and it is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so i will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes my impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous the price \? great price i got mine for somthing like 25 \( buy from abuy4u \) but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset yes 6 hours can last me a weekend	13
1	the gta series is the best games ever created the freedom to do what ever you want take out gangs with a rocket launcher toss a nade into heavy populated areas kill the police and take their cars put out fires and earn money beat up civilians and take their money help mob bosses pick up hookers with a taxi and drop them off hack people to death with a chainsaw own mansions and other properties fly on a jetpack kill army soldiers and take their tanks and jets listen to radio stations and humorous radio talk shows and ads like pogo the monkey just the best games ever created	13
1	my son is enthralled with this game ! he is learning while being entertained the graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the mac ! what more could we ask for	13
1	this is a great game for puzzel lovers and is n't easy this is a great game to play on stormy dark night sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save just when you think you have it figured out something new happens even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time trust me you will never be bored	13
0	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13
1	it is not a false advertisement it is just meant for the newer models of the playstation 2 that have a built in ir receiver which is why it does n't include it	13
1	it 's worth playing and spending hours of playing warning this game is rated mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc no need to buy the walkthrough because the game it 's not really that difficult ca n't wait for god of war 2 that will come out 2007 \( which luckily for ps2 instead of ps3 \)	13
0	this extension cable did not work with my standard microsoft s controller unless you still use the old monster sized xbox controller these cables are worthless	13
1	graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any rpg fan	13
0	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
1	the price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping \( express \) or about 7 \( office depot \) who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not amazon this much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke	13
1	for the price is a good deal i only use one card i have the other one for backup nice product good pric	13
1	i love this game ! it 's not too hard for kids to play \( my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets \) and it 's not trashy so parents can let their kids play it they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy it 's also cool so us adults can play as well ! i love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like jesse james and the jester etc the graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also	13
1	cicken little is a fantastic game this game is full of diffrent things like little bit of fighting sports unioform hunt and more the best part i like is the carpool craze	13
1	if you liked the first kh you will like this one	13
1	i know how you feel about the incredibales movie it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys violet is just running around invisible elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile was n't the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no i in team well you are all by you 're self in this playing one charcter per level please note all movies made into games are ba	13
1	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
1	i bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys they play this game non stop basically until they 're completely worn out the game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months ! if your kids have a ps2 then this game is a must have ! !	13
1	as far as wireless bridges go this item is expensive some can be had for 40 50 at other sites but those items are a seperate item with another plug and would require more space this adapter is designed to work perfectly with the the 360 and does just that it connects to the back of the console \( and hd dvd drive if you purchase that \) and use the power of the 360 it does n't take up any extra space and has a strong connection i would recommend it to anyone that has a wireless network in their home	13
0	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
1	i was very eager to get this title on import knowing that it was somewhat 'unique' in terms of it 's genre label yes it has rpg elements but it 's something quite separate i only wish there were more such games on the ps2 or any format for that matter this is storytelling videogame style at it 's best capcom clover have produced a real gem it 's an experience like zelda a highly enjoyable slice of fantasy that is sure to hold you in it 's thrall for some 50 hours or more a visual treat and beautiful soundtrack also if you consider yourself a gamer then get this it 's destined for cult status in a word superb	13

0	the review by bovey is spot on ! these games have gotten more boring as they go the majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough \? there was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom ! and the game was so short suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed in what these games have become i loved the final scene i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough this game was just lame i do n't recommend paying full price for it	13
0	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	13
1	blinx can be very time consuming for us older xbox players \( whom did n't grow up with a controller in our hands \) i found blinx to be fun entertaining and challenging even though it is rated for younger children i think the strategy involved is for older children teenagers and some of us adults for anyone wishing to have some fun have to think a bit blinx is for you	13
1	i played this game with some friends out of town and seriously had to acquire a ps2 just to satisfy my craving not a shooter game not an rpg you just roll seriously it 's surprisingly awesome actually but my big disappointment came when after about 2 days of mildly committed playing it was done i 'd beat it and i'm really not a big gamer and i do n't know how much mileage i'm really gonna get out of the sort of limited 2 player mode maybe the sequel is better i hope	13
1	this is one of the best racing games i have ever played you can do so many modifications to your car	13
1	if you 're going to play karaoke revolution this is the mic for you i now have 2 so that my wife and i can play in duet mode it 's much better than the headset for just 17 bucks you can have a 'real' mic that feels so much more natural if you play kr a lot invest in this microphone	13
0	my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i	13
0	the gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun ! the kids did n't even like it run do n't walk away from this dentist office of a game jaws cr p \( jaws just another w smith	13
1	it is a fun first person shooter game the graphics are decent and the story line 's ok the game 's play time is about 15 20 hours	13
1	there is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than dungeons and dragons and that is star wars this game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things it is a flawless game	13
1	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
1	its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time same differance with highspeed and dialup if you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally i like my 360 remote	13
0	bought two of these one as a gift and one for myself luckily i tried mine out before i gave the other away this thing just vibrates no massage at all ! ! after 30 seconds you get nausea its not worth 23 99 its a piece of junk trust me you are not getting a bargain i guess you pay for what you get but in this case i ca n't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub	14
1	i 've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best strong motor easy adjust strong vacuum other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me one would n't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard the idea is to glide the unit over your beard you 're not raking you 're trimming ! also the unit is easy to clean out after use the waste receptacle snaps out easily as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris	14
0	the plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner i was not in the same state when the package arrived so i was not able to open it for over a month my loss i do n't know if it was not structurally sound or if the box was just not handled properly either way i 've got a dud	14
1	my wife and i have used this a few times now and really like it from a novice 's point of view this is a great meditation aid i like being able to get the visual feedback as i calm and center myself i guess the hardest part is not letting myself get too anxious as i try to accomplish the task in front of me it 's also a very pretty game with very lush and detailed visuals as well as a nice soundtrack	14
0	even though a set looked exactly like on a picture bare in mind that the box is about the size of a paperback and it weighs about the same all the bottles are realy tiny they look like a one time use products the once you receive for free with your purchase and the brush quality is not what i expected from this company if you are looking for a present you will feel rather embarassed to give it	14
0	these wipes are very rough we bought these when our daughter was first born and i ended up not using them on her because she would scream everytime i used them if your baby has sensitive skin i would recommend the huggies newborn or the huggies supreme wipes wipe your face with one and you will see how scratchy they are imagine how your baby 's bottom feels afterward	14
1	i just bought this iron and i could n't be happier it 's the perfect size and weight the plates are n't unmanageably large or pitifully small it heats up incredibly fast we 're talking in less than 60 seconds i have short ish wavy and coarse hair it 's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes hai is a brand used in many salons and it 's all for a reason they make fantastic flat irons if you bought this same iron at a salon you could easily pay upwards of 150 in canada so i consider this price an awesome deal	14
0	i just purchased a new heating pad to replace the one i had for years i read the reviews and could not decide between all the choices price being the primary concern the saying you get what you paid for is true ! ! the heating pad works ok but the outer edges of this pad scratch you and the covering cloth is very cheap pay more and be happier	14
0	i have bought this product and i have gained 5lbs it didnt worked on me i guess you just have to try the product i just ordered hoodoba on amazon and hoping that will work hoodoba has good ratings	14
1	i got mine for free on sale at least 6 months ago and it 's great i know i should probably replace the head by now but it still seems to work fine so i do n't i 've only changed the battery once if you want a cheap brush that gets the job done easier than the old fashioned type this is it then again if you 're not lazy or weak you can probably do just as good a job with a regular toothbrush and not waste batteries	14
1	adds a great fragrance to the room we bought several different scents and placed them throughout the house it 's a different smell in every room what a pleasant change from smelling the pets	14
0	with in the first 4 days and only 3 uses my bottom plate was already flaking it catches your hair and the only to get it out is to pull which does hurt it works ok the first couple of times but i find i am scared to put it on a high temp cuz i dont want it to flake so if you have 30 and you want this product keep saving and get a better one this product is not worth your time	14

1	i have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist it works for me but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing brushing and generally good tooth care	14
0	i bought this for a far sighted relative but it did n't magnify enough and was distractinly blurry so the gift was n't well received i give this two thumbs down	14
1	i 've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed	14
1	i have used opti free enzymatic cleaner for years still with the same great results i have a feeling this type of product wo n't be around much longer because my using extended wear contacts seems to be a rarity at my optometrist 's office where everyone else is wearing the disposal lenses that are always in stock	14
1	no problems like the small format bottle easy to store works as well as anything else	14
1	nicely designed effecitve close shave very reasonable cost but could they tell you simply how to turn it on \? embarassed to admit took me almost 15 minutes to figure out the on off feature	14
1	this give an excellent finish to a shave i strongly suggest using the shaving oil as well apply hot water to dilate your pores then apply the oil then shaving cream shave and finally the after shave balm the oil and balm make for an amazing shaving experience your face feels incredibly smooth afterward i do n't use it every day because it is a little more time consuming that just applying the shaving cream alone but i do use the products above most of the time because of the great feel after	14
1	great smell worth the cost cleans great i have used this laundry soap for quite some time now and happy	14

0	though not advertised to humidify a large room i found it incapable of making any significant difference in even a small room i tested it in a roughly 1000 cubic foot room by placing a relative humidity sensor in the middle of the room and after 2 hours not even a 1 increase in humidity ! fortunately i was able to receive a full refund	14
0	the charlatans who makes this deserve to be shot and so does anybody stupid enough to buy it eat a balanced diet and get some exercise do n't be a moron all your life	14
0	the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them and i could not get the hooks to work i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it and it failed far short of the maximum weight on the package in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures which i had to hang with other hardware	14
1	this is a great sized foot bath i pour hot water in it sit back and relax it does n't keep the water warm but if i start off with really hot water it stays warm until i'm ready to get out using the pedicure attachements is hard work though i just assume use a hand held brush the bubble feature is too loud to use while watching tv still for the price i like this foot bath i 've even given it as a gift	14
0	i bought these professional clippers only to discover they are very unprofessional ! i am very disatissfied with this product and would not reccomend it to anyone the blades guards slip off easily and the clippers get stuck in my hair which hurts a lot try looking for a better quality hair clipper	14
1	i 've tried many types of nutrition bars and many are too sweet or they are not tasty clif bars get it right	14
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in so i married an axe murderer the idea concept is great but i 'll probably return them unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them people with really big heads caveat emptor	14

0	after a very positive review by a popular consumer magazine i purchased this scale on the unit i received the upper weight range appears to be overstated by some 20 lbs the scale i was previously using and the one in my doctors office clearly have my weight below the 300 lb limit i have been lifting weights and somewhat discouraged by the scale alone i wanted to see if i was having an impact on body fat so i purchased this scale when i attempt to use this scale it errors out with the ol code perhaps the magazine should retract another article	14
0	save your money you will go over an area several times i went back to my basic razor	14
1	these never leak and are good enough to wear over night this is the only diaper i buy	14
1	i bought this item because i was going to europe for a month i did n't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time unless you buy more than one converter kit you do need a plug adaptor \( these are relatively inexpensive \) then you just switch the voltage plug it in and it works great i used it in switzerland france and italy when i came home to the states i just switched the voltage back and i now use it at home it is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase i would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad	14
0	while the pedal exerciser mechanically works fine the plastic or something on it smells so bad it is not pleasant to keep inside i have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better i called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but do n't have any solutions i asked if they had a website i could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2 3 months right	14
0	i ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price but it doesnot keep the warm water warm for 10 mintues the pedicure set is hard to use the bubbles are not effective i guess cheap is expensive ! ! !	14
0	i have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest however i was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow advil i used sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help but nothing seemed to work the taste is n't bad and i used the bleach with my own trays that i had made by my dentist so it did n't leak out or touch my gums my teeth were n't sensitive while i was using it or even right afterwards but later in the day if you have sensitive teeth i do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain	14
1	i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued \( like i could hardly move \) i had been taking a general multi vitamin from a local warehouse store i started taking the nature 's plus source of life and i felt so much better my energy level has increased dramatically and i just feel good great quality product	14

1	i had reasently bought this vibrator because i like trying out did kinds of vibrators to get more pleasure from and well i would have to say this one and my magic wand vibrator well i like this one better because it is cordless so i can use it anywhere in my home even away from an outlet like in my car and no cord gets in the way it also has a very flexable soft head that feels really very good when i use it it has really strong motor that can make me have some exteme orgasms that fell very good and last it looks to be made very well so it probly will last pretty long i hope so	14
1	i suffer from upper back and shoulder tension i 've been using neck warmers for years but recently lost the only one i had after looking at many warmers i chose the happy wrap the wrap stays warm for more than an hour and has the moist heat which is perfect for tense muscles my yorkshire terrier ca n't wait until i'm done using it and fights with the cat to get it when i'm finished	14
0	i purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep well folks this is not what happened at all i turned on my conair su1w and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day about 5 minutes into my relaxation i almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck the volume which seemed to have been controlled by satan reached top volume although i never had touched it myself i tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring i unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times and still it would not work	14

0	i'm not sure how reliable these types of thermometers are so i do n't know whether to say this one or these types are not very reliable either way it is really hard to get a correct temperature or to know if you have gotten a correct temperature with this thermometer i follow the instructions and have to repeat them over and over before i get a consistent reading i threw mine away	14
1	first this is a big and cumbersome but second this is the best foot spa got it for the wife and had to try it myself i am a wuss when it comes to super hot temps and i had to ease into the heat it stayed hot the entire time the jets were nice and the wireless remote is priceless \( just make sure its in your hand when you sit down so you do n't have to move an inch \) \) the rollers on the bottom are nice too it gets loud when on high jets mode but nothing to grand fast shipper would recommend	14

0	design seems flawed a bit for the container when you pull the cord out it bumps the tank off sometimes the tank also seems a little loose when mounted i tried the newest ultra dental water pik type but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water	14
0	i thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great i would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product also i loved the pink when i opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off i tried to snap them into place but they would not stay for the amount of money i payed i expected a much better product needless to say i returned it the next day	14
0	skip this entire product i made the mistake of purchasing it and stocked up on the scrubbing and non scrubbing \( mopping \? \) pads now i ca n't find the non scrubbing ones anywhere in my entire county i think they do n't want to compete with their own product swiffer which they also manufacture i emailed them and they suggested i buy online i checked walgreens com and drugstore com and no luck i imagine they will phase this out and you will be stuck with a wasteful who gives a hoot rod	14
0	this little machine is not worth the cost of the plastic to make it i assumed since wahl has a long time history of manufacturing grooming products that this would be a quality item was i ever wrong this trimmer is constructed poorly and does n't cut hair it will be heading to the trash	14
0	it warms ok not great but the worst thing is the massage is loud ! i work at home in my basement where it gets cold and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm and was excited to get massage too however i ca n't use the massage feature while i am on the phone it is way too loud and there is no control on the heating element just on and off a disappointment i still use the heat feature but also wear thick socks	14
0	cheezy as cheezy can be the only feature i liked was that this item could be returned ! the sound was terrible not easy to tune flimsy design and the gimmick to have it look like a bug was only cute if you are 10 years old this thing is junk and not worth the price of the batteries it requires mine was promptly returned	14

0	i am amazed that all these so called health foods will add artery clogging palm kernel oil as an ingredient do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil cocoa butter and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many organic things are added to it for many years now it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases	14
0	i think the shaver works well but the plastic is thin and cheap the biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor cleaning brush and charger i think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case	14

1	i'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads \( about 10 20 of them \) that was before now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless	14
1	the shaver was very good it gives a very close shave not only do i shave my face but i also shave my head it feels like i use a normal shaver after i am done my nly advice is to empty the hair out between every shave it seems to give a better shave this wa	14
1	the product is very good do not misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt when we bought it ten years ago the curls tend to stay put less time compared with the former hair curler tubes but still we strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes it 's a good buy	14

1	i was skeptical of this product especially at the price however i am so pleased with its effectiveness i rely on other reviewers remarks and so i am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price i ca n't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple when i think of all the money i 've spent on products over the years and i'm in my 40s ! i was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red angry looking spot this product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne i only wish the zeno was around when i was a teenager	14

0	first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf 203c cascadia showerhead it is all plastic ! i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal sedondly even with the head made of plastic the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall we installed it repeatedly following each step of the instructions every time thinking we were missing something i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon	14
0	i bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working ans i do agree the smaller the hair straightener the better \( i originally had a smaller one that my salon uses but it also stopped working \) the light is on and the heat comes off and on randomly very upsetting	14

0	amazon and this company are nightmares i ordered this scale a month ago and the expected ship date keeps changing i finally called amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever he was no help at all after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade all he was able to give me was the ship date range which has already changed several times amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time	14
0	i thought they might 've improved the hgm 15 model forget about it both models are lousy buy foreign it might work better	14
1	i have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it it gets very hot warm very fast and is very comforting i use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches i would recommend this product to anyone i'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift	14

1	they had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and i stayed at and i fell in love with it ! i had to have one of my own and thanks to amazon i was able to find one this is an excellent product my husband installed it easily and i would never be without one again one side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good lol and eyelining is a breeze though he would never admit it my husband uses also \( trimming mustash nose hairs \( eewww \) shaving etc \) great product order one you will not be dissapointed !	14
0	the foil is a bit misleading because if you are shaving parts of your body with many curves \( under the zipper \) the timmer will catch you and it hurts a lot the foil can only be used on straight surfaces the two trimmer blases rest at about a 200degree angle if you have to many curves to mow with the foil without hitting the trimmer well be prepared to spend a night or two on the sofa	14
1	i absolutely love this little book light it is so slim and easy to store plus i can use it for my magazines and paperbacks i highly recommend this item a	14
0	i 've had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well i 've worn out 3 norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase i thought this razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it i have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face i'm going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift	14
1	i love this straightener ! i have had two other straighteners including one from a salon that cost over 80 and this one works much better then either of the other two all my friends also love it and are always asking to barrow it	14
1	the shampoo does n't lather but it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day and it seems to be doing it 's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch free since i started using it so i would recommend it	14
0	i'm sorry that i ordered these online i should have tried them first they do not fit round heads no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit the bow needs to have an adjustment too the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off would not buy another pair	14
0	i gave this item as a gift so i was disappointed when after only a few months of use it was broken i'm not sure what happened but my haircutter has lasted for years	14
1	i bought another one of these because i dropped my orginal at the grocery store and broke the bulb i tried contacting the company with this new one u cannot get an answer the company seems to have a non working number other than that the product ok and i havent been sick since i have used it	14
1	i was very suprised at how small the units were \( i ordered 2 \) but they work great and run very quietly the filter is very easy to change i have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that i switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space i would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money	14
1	i am diabetic and i have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein they satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling	14
0	hello i recently bought this blood pressure monitor it functions all well but it gives incorrect readings i mean the readings vary significantly not once twice but many many times i was and am never sure about the validity of the readings purchase this at your own risk my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors atleast u will know that the readings r genuine and u can always find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings take care and stay healthy	14
1	i recently started weight watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale i figured i would buy a ww product but after reading the reviews i decided to go with the omron scale i am very pleased with this product it has been extremely accurate it keeps a history for both my husband and i i would highly recommend this scale to anyone ! it is also an attractive scale which is a bonus go with the omron scale	14
0	i finally got this toothbrush after i have seen alot of people use them i am very disappointed the design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky it 's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste it 's very hard to clean it 's loud and small brush not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive no thank you	14
0	if i had saved the box i would have returned this product the head has no pressure what so ever and the head does not screw onto the pipe spout straight so it is always crooked and it wasnt just one shower i tried it one both of my showers and it was crooked on both pipes	14
0	i recieved these dead they do n't fit right in most devices and i have n't been able to get them to work since they 've been recharged it 's not my charger waste of mone	14
0	the individual packaging is nice but the floss breaks frequently nexcessitating more than one to floss your teath the glide products are much nicer	14
1	great features ! probably the best pedometer out there for the money the only reason i give 4 vice 5 stars is that i think the one i bought for my mom \( same brand and model \) is slightly more accurate a great way to track your fitness overall	14
0	i had to return my recent purchase due to a defect i have used waterpik dental water jets for many many years and typically have to replace every two or three years i was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet i purchased the waterpik ultra and i am pleased with the design size and operation thus far i just hope waterpik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service	14
0	ordered this item on sept 28 they were supposed to ship it within 1 week after 1 week i received an email they said they needed 2 more weeks another email today \( nov 7 \) they think they can deliver it by november 27 that 's 2 months after i placed my order at this point i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year fortunately with amazon they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order which is what i am going to do right now	14
0	sorry to say but this product did not work as promised the black canister does not hold any type or brand of lather can only gel type cans i did call the customer service number and asked why this is and the rep told me that it is a type o on the package in order to use with a lather can you just put the device on the top of the can and use as is the older model product did fit the lather type cans but this one does not sorry but if you are going to use this with a lather can you might want to get the older white model the product looks starange when you cant use the black canister as pictured	14
1	it is the best product of it type on the market and i wish it were more available in stores i do n't know what you mean by give your review a titl	14
0	i bought this after i read the first review below \( the one who gave this 5 stars \) it just does n't work very well i do a better job pumicing on my own \( it just takes more effort \) the motor does get extremely hot and the batteries die very quickly the box says it can run for 45 minutes on two aa 's but after about 5 minutes you can feel it slow down definitely not worth it i'm calling today to return it	14
1	nizoral anti dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product i noticed a difference the first time i used it there was no residue on my scalp and my flakiness was greatly reduced it produced a very rich lather also the only thing i did n't like about it was the possibility that i 'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients but the instructions did n't tell which ingredients might make this happen i myself am sensitive to many products and did n't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo i would recommend this product to others	14
1	saw this product or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns australia it was selling for about 70 australia dollars which is still quite expensive converted to us i came back to u s and found it on amazon for 15 99 with free ship if i purchased 30 so i bought two one for myself one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks less the neckchains which always used to get tangled it 's an ingenius invention	14
1	dr bonners pepperming soap is our favorite our sensitive skin does not react it lasts a long time and best of all the peppermint aroma wakes up our senses in the mornings	14
1	i 've used hot air brushes for a couple years this works better than my last the low setting and the larger brush works better for me the high setting blows the hair off the bristles it 's nice having the small brush option for different styles though i believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron	14
0	the mattress pad topper has a strong chemical smell after receiving it i left it in an open room for 2 weeks before i can sleep on it the free pillow smells even worse it can be not exchanged since it is free i guess i am supposed to toss it since it 's free i think it will be fair to mention that the topper is comfortable after all	14
1	great price good product escellent service i will buy from this supplier again	14
0	do not buy this prouct because it is made of cheap quality and the attachable plastic combs are hard to attach and break very easily the small parts that attach the combs also snapped off without applying much force this product looks like a good value because of the number of accessories but they will be useless when you throwing it out within only two months as i was forced to after all of the parts broke off save your money and avoid	14
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor the toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious does n't taste like a candy bar and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market	14
1	i had never used an auto cuff before so i had my doubts but after using this over a period of weeks it seems to be right on the money every time i would buy it agai	14
0	i purchased the product used it for 2 days and it has not worked since the compnay has yet to respond to my request for return and amazon excepts no liabilty needless to say i wasted money	14
0	the description says slipcover zips off for easy cleaning but the product did not come with a slipcover the pillow itself is in the blue gingham pattern now i have to find a slipcover that wo n't blend in with the blue gingham pattern underneath	14
0	i bought it new after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower it stopped working i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior including the electronics they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower i have not opened the shaver i have not cleaned it in water thus based on my experience this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned	14
1	the refills were easy to order fit my brush perfectly it 's a lot easier ordering on line received in home rather than trying to find the merchandise in a store	14
1	i have purchased a total of 12 of these batteries \( 6 two packs \) and i must say that they work exactly how i projected them to they hold a charge well enough for my uses in various electronics and my infant 's papasan swing regular duracell alkalines will keep the swing running for a few days these batteries on a full charge almost match the alkalines' life and i have recharged and reused many times already with no sign of charge loss i am very pleased so far with my purchase get these until hybrid nimh batteries in size d become easily available and cheaper	14
1	my wife and i both love this in our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable head trip than the trippers one might find in the mall the vibrations make it better than the non vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations it 's a pretty simple device sold at a reasonable cost and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones	14
0	over time \( 9 months \) my aquasana filter developed cracks in both the shower head and filter housing customer service told me to buy a new one i guess it really is 'all about the money' pass this loser buy a metal body filter	14
1	my physician introduced me to this item he said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods is affordable and easy to use oh did i forget to mention accurate compaired to a scale model i own amazon is great to order from the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days !	14
1	my mother is 87 and the shower chair makes it easier she likes it in the tub better and i just use warm water poured over her	14
0	title says it all it simply does not work yes it turns and trims a hair here and there but i would not purchase this again i am happy with my other wahl product	14
1	i 've been wearing glasses for almost 25 years now its been difficult to find a decent way to clean glasses that does n't either streak or damage the lenses especially with ar and other coatings they put on glasses these days the sharper image eyeglass cleaner does the trick it also by design cleans your frames which is a plus i would have given 4 5 stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply its sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses i have two pair \( regular and sunglasses \) so no real fault there i recommend getting a 3m microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what is supplied	14
1	i recently a box of two 12 ounce bottles of this neutrogna produst at costco for approximately 9 00 22 00 for the same quantity is too expensive for me to want to shop for these products at amazon	14
1	great product easy to use and simple to follow instruction keeps me in the zone to burn calories while on my walks i recommend it to anyone it doesnt interface with gym exercise equipment but i dont use them anyway and it doesnt cost 3 to 4 times what one of those do buy it wear it be happy	14
0	sorry sleepmd we are not impressed not only did sleepmd not work for me but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too today we feel worse for the wear and a bit ripped off no i did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed more like we were run over during the night i wanted to inquire to the company in person but ca n't find a website to do so so i plan to write i would n't recommend this product to anyone it 's a waste of money	14
0	this is easily the worst beard trimmer i 've used it slips and cuts hair much shorter than anticipated and the teeth on the guard are far too fine	14
0	this shampoo made my dandruff even worse after using it it did make my scalp feel cool and cleansed but an hour later i combed my hair and there were huge flakes in it if you have to pay a little more for a dandruff shampoo buy paul mitchell 's tea tree shampoo or something	14
1	i called nature made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury their fish oil is usp tested for purity and potency there is n't any mercury free fish oil however nm contains only 01 mcg g of mercury very low level and certainly not toxic i'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently fyi they have a great website that contains all this information	14
1	this stuff is awesome for hangovers it was like my high school staple ! i mean i went through like a box a week at least give it a try	14
1	i gave this to a bearded man for christmas to my knowledge he has used it only once with no complaints was nice for the main reason he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it purchasing was a breeze thank yo	14
1	these seem to be an excellent product there is little or not leakage the wipes were a nice treat	14
1	i really like these things they 're certainly chewy so they can be a bit of a jaw workout but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar and they keep you going for a couple of hours if only they were a little cheaper say a dollar or less per bar i 'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than i do right now	14
0	i bought this from qvc after i had to send back a braun silk epil the epilator really irritated by skin caused major bumps and redness waxing just hurts too much and is really messy this sounded ideal i just wanted to have a smoother look on my cheeks and upper lip it trims down your facial hair however the next day you will notice stubble you have to really look close to see it but you can really feel it you might as well shave i have not used the brow attachment i saw the demo on qvc but am afraid i will shave my brows off would love to know what others think of this item	14
1	they taste good and stop those hunger pangs for quite some time	14
1	very light electric razor cuts shaving time from 10 minutes down to 3 minutes so a charge for 30 minutes of shaving time easily lasts a week when running it is as quiet as an old fashioned blade does a great job very quickly and smoothly you do n't need anything more	14
0	i could not get the right code numbers to work with my new tv dvd set too bad i liked the large numbers and light	14
0	it should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator ! i'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind i'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head neck the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator just be forewarned customers this item is not for the easily offended	14
1	it takes some getting used to but once you do you will love it it leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush electric or other that i have ever used you feel at first like it is totally strange \( it is ! \) does n't take more than a few times using it to realize that it 's a great concept and so much faster than anything else i have no buyers remorse i just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person you really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle	14
0	this product was not as i expected it is much weaker than ones used in the past it certainly was not worth the price i paid i returned this item	14
0	it does n't really smell like anything and the heat creates dampness on what ever you put it on but it is a good size and shape	14
1	we only use seventh generation laundry products now it is amazing how much better our clothes feel with these products the baby detergent gets the babies very dirty clothes very clean in our front loader	14
1	lightweight easy to transport easy to put together just remember the person in the chair cannot maneuver on their own someone must be able to push but what a great product	14
1	bumble bumble products are a special me treat for pampering the shampoo is mild and keeps my long permed hair in great shape	14
1	i get compliments all the time on this scent it is one of my favorites it smells exactly like cotton candy its fun flirty and nostalgic of childhood romps at the fair ! if you like sweet edible scents then this one is for you	14
0	i had heard that chocoleans were effective but i was very disappointed they taste good but did n't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth about the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate i wound up gaining weight while using these	14
0	this item does not work it does absolutely nothing i bought one and then was sent a second one neither one works it was a gift and i felt so bad that i gave someone a gift that did n't work	14
1	best hair dryer ever i have long thick curly frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x my hair is shiny and soft the diffuser is also amazing i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz by far the best dryer out there in this price range granted it 's heavy but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus ! it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones \?	14
1	i have n't actually used the bottles sent to me as of yet but used this product all last summer i love the fact that the blue lizard suncream stays on so well my kids can swim and stay at the beach for hours and blue lizard does the trick ! ! ! i do n't think they got burnt one time last year while i was using this great product ! !	14
1	i had a horrible cold felt like complete but i had to work this little two ounce vitamin b shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and i was able to get some work done there really is no crash and the taste is n't that bad it tastes like a melted freeze pop note it may give you the jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach	14
1	excellent price and quick shipping this was the best available for 3 4 oz size	14
0	since our bathroom cabinet is short on space i loved the idea of this hair dryer ! unfortunately the idea was more a fantasy than a reality i only had this hair dryer for about a month before the cord keeper button fell out \( spring and all ! \) and the retractible cord stopped retracting since that was the only reason i bought this one over other models i was sorely disappointed ! also this dryer is so l o u d that i had to wear earplugs \( no kidding ! \) while drying my hair so that i would n't damage my hearing ! hands down the worst hair dryer on the market	14
0	would have been better if i actually got this i ordered this and got 6 dr bronner 's lavender soap with a hemp tree soap bar code on the back i'm too lazy to send back and i already opened one and the lavender is nice but i would rather have the hemp tree afraid to order again	14
1	i have tried a gazillion of these diet protein bars this is the only one i 've actually found so far that tastes good	14
0	i first bought the standard and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well i used them riding a bike in the winter months neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit for the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering \( and prevent tearing \) causes great pressure above the ear the rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists	14
1	you could n't have picked a better person to test drive this product i have severely dried and callused heals from the moment i put the creme on my feet they felt smoother the creme stays on for hours like the product says i ca n't believe the difference it 's made in such a short time i 'll definitely buy this product and i 'll be recommending it to my mom whose feet are drier than mine are	14
0	my biggest issue with this shaker is that it does n't seal properly around the threaded part of the cap even if i really tighten it up i still get a small leak when i shake it also the cap for the mouthpiece pops off pretty easy but overall it gets the job done and having fluid graduations on the side are nice	14
1	i have two penguin humidifiers which i purchased a couple of months ago for the money i think these are great and simple to use i did not have any problems with leakage the key is to make sure that the top is on securely also some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base just carry a washcloth with you no problem super quiet i think it is just the right size for a bedroom easy to clean and fill i had tried others \( honeywell and vicks \) and this is by far my favorite	14
1	very classy scent very strong spray sparingly a little goes a long way lasts all day will receive many compliments	14
0	i know everyone else has had good luck with this but not me the unit started running really slow after about a minute it also seems to scrape my face another nit pick is that the adjustable spacer does not have any marks or numbers on it so you do n't know what setting you 're on	14
0	stay away from this seller salter i ordered this product 20 days ago and finally got an email saying that there 's an unexpected delay ! i cancelled right away after waiting for almost a month	14
1	i received this parfum as a birthday gift and i fell in love with it as soon as i smelled it the scent lasts all day without being too overbearing i swear every single time i wear this someone stops me and asks what am i wearing the fragrance is crisp and sensual it kind of reminds me of bath body works' moonlight path buy it you wo n't regret it especially for the price that amazon is offering it for	14
0	in two minutes it flucuated over 5 pounds do n't waste your money the 11 sunbeam dial scale is more accurate	14
1	i got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and i thought they 'd improve upon the mach3 well they did ! this turbo brand of mach 3 is actually much better his shave lasts longer the blades last longer and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave i choose this one over that mach3 power vibrating blade because i do n't know a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion haha he 's very happy with it and likes the shave and speaking about money if the shave and blades last longer than before it 's a great value ! highly suggested ! !	14
1	great enginering design and craftmanship works great every day but i had to throw away a travel size waterpick after 18 months because it is impossible to obtain a replacement hose assembly from the manufacturer or anywhere else it does n't make any sense to supply an irreplaceable disposable part on an equipment designed to outlast it three times	14
0	i have used three of these the first two each lasted a year before shorting out i kept buying them because i liked the cordkeeper function this last one though shorted out and started a fire i have notified the company and will see what happens but i doubt that i will purchase another it 's obvious that this product has an engineering or manufacturing flaw and should be pulled off the market	14
1	i have had so much fun learning bio feedback and learnig to breath the exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation i highly recommned this product i will be purchasing the add on in the near future	14
0	the wieght is accurate but the body fat is way off i had my body fat done 6 months ago by a doctor and i was 12 six months later i wiegh 5 lbs less and the scales says i'm 25 something is off and i trust the doctor if all you want is to see your wieght its fine but the rest well find another scale	14
1	well this is marketed as a quick and healthy snack for kids but i find it perfect for me it 's a great charge of chocolate and not too many calories and bit of fiber what more can you ask for	14
1	these batteries are used non stop one set in and one on the charger no problems would buy again !	14
1	this is by far my favorite out of all the odwalla bars i used to purchase it at trader joe 's but they no longer carry this flavor so i was especially delighted when i saw it on amazon	14
1	just love the homedic foot bath easy to use and very ssothingon the feet the pedicure attachments are a plus the price was just great !	14
0	it was a nice looking razor but it did n't work and i had to send it back for credit i bought another one locally and had trouble with it also i wonder if the 5200 just does n't have to many bells whistles i finally bought a 5100 it 's a plain jane but is working great	14
1	a good product to be sure i 've used seventh generation 's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased this review is however a cautionary while it states on amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads it is only rated for 18 loads just a heads up ! note i tried to notify amazon about this but their system for corrections is inoperable at the moment thus this review	14
0	i used it one time placed it on the charger and it never worked again now i face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair not happy with my internet purchase from your company	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
0	unfortunately the stool arrived in its box without the seat as we needed one quickly we purchased a similar stool locally we returned the stool and amazon was quick to give us a refund the manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control	14
0	we received it with broken cover it did n't work properly and stopped running every hour we tried different ways to make it run but nothing worked we 've returned it it 's just waste of money on the other hand the cow humidifier which we bought at the same time is fine and running well no complaints	14
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor the toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious does n't taste like a candy bar and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market	14
1	item was received in perfect shape it is a wonderful item and a great buy	14
0	this one is too small for a bedroom just like a toy i returned this one and reordered sunbeam 701 000 ultrasonic humidifier which is much bigger generally speaking the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones	14
1	i have tried the gerber nursing pads and one other brand these nursing pads are the best i have a large supply of milk but i have not leaked through these pads they are also very soft and they are not visible through your clothing	14
1	although i am a writer who composes on the computer i often do my editing on hard copy in a comfortable chair until i started using the posture rite lap desk i could not do this comfortably now i have it it fits my lap perfectly i use it and love it i recommend it highly	14
0	i bought this item for the warmth the heat level is so low that i never can tell when the heat is on as for the massage it 's about what i expected no good at all overall i would say this item is worthless	14
1	wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially but also in your neck and feet your body feels so relaxed after using the theracane	14
0	light didnt turn off mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall and mirror became foggy !	14
0	i do n't know what those other people were talking about but this energy drink tastes like melted popsicles it 's basically just gatorade with more sugar in it if you want an energy drink instead of a sweetened sports drink you should look elsewhere	14
1	have n't had to clean it yet and it keeps the humidity level in out daughter 's room between 41 and 53 we have had it for 3 months now and no problems at all works as advertised and worth every penny	14
0	i do n't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose i do n't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all as i said i do n't have a huge melon like mike myers 's brother in so i married an axe murderer the idea concept is great but i 'll probably return them unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them people with really big heads caveat emptor	14

0	i purchased this dryer because of the shape and attachments and wanted to try an ionic dryer first of all if this is an ionic dryer i was better off with my super cheap dryer second the back seam of the dryer melted ! ! several people have mentioned that it overheats and they are not lying it shuts off and refuses to come back on which is good because then it might melt completely do n't waste your money on this	14
1	i have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it it is easy to use and clean i have only had to charge it once so far even though this is my first electric shaver it is a good deal for the money it does n't shave as close as a razor but it 's close i would recommend it or give it as a gift	14
1	i get this stuff for my husband he 's got really thick hair and it has the tendency to get oily but this stuff makes his hair perfectly soft and shiny it 's worth the money	14
0	i agree with the other reviews it was a huge disappointment that it did n't heat the water it is only supposed to maintain the temperature but after using it for about 20 minutes it did n't even do that the manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth back to the store indeed	14
1	excellent product good quality at a good price i bought this whal 's trimmer to replace a whal 's trimmer that i have used for over 15 years that alone speaks for itself	14

0	i have heard fabulous things about gripe water from fellow mothers but this particular brand is horrible the scent is strong and the taste is strong and medicinal there are other gripe water brands out there that do not have such scent taste upon ingesting only 1 ml of this gripe water my 7 week old daughter gagged repeatedly and vomited up until then she never vomited before if you want to try gripe water find another brand	14
0	i originally planned to purchase locin floss to replace the dentek but i'm not too pleased with it so far pluses each individually wrapped floss does n't contain floride minuses flimpsy handle almost not usable wrap is not 100 sealed flossing head is shallower and narrower than the dentek	14
0	after doing extensive research on the web i purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor while the easy fit cuff was easy to place the b p readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous b p cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor 's office since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings i returned the b p cuff to amazon for a refund	14

0	i once had a cheap shaver i got at sears that i learned was made for sears by remington i liked that shaver so when i found the r 950 at sears on sale for 40 i decided to replace my old top selling brand rotary shaver big mistake after 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck \( especially with drier winter skin \) not to mention the occasional cut lip i get with the r 950 while trying to shave around the mouth i am going back to my old shaver how can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave but it does	14
0	i purchased this unit and was dissatisfied with comparisons i made at the doctor 's office i next purchased an omron arm unit and found the results to be more valid and reliable the wrist unit is very cool but did not live up to consumer reports suggestion that it had acceptable validity i'm technically savvy an excellent instructions follower and really wanted to like this unit but i cannot recommend it skip the cool wrist unit and get an arm unit if at all possible	14
1	after going back and forth between oil of olay and neutrogena i settled on this product mostly because of the price \( plus no one complained about the granules getting into their eyes \) i'm happy with the results my skin is softer and appears to have taken on more clarity the orange smell is lovely and it only takes two minutes \( i do it in the shower \) of course it 's not microdermabrasian but it is a great exfolliater for your skin	14
0	i went through 3 of these in less than 2 months after about 2 3 weeks of use the first two dryers would n't shut off when the switch was placed in the off position the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off the 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks i definitely do not recommend buying this product	14

0	tried this product for 2 weeks it did improve the clarity and softness but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well seemed to have a sticky feel since then i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare this product performs like magic it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush i can do the treatment 2 3x 's a week \( like your supposed to \) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before it is a magical product bette hampton chicago i	14
0	this product is great at exfoliating not so great at hair removal your skin will be silky smooth but still have hair the hair that is removed does n't stay gone long and it 's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body it will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product	14
1	really strong when just sprayed but after a little while it gets soft but at the same time not too soft the perfume lasts for few hours by the time i go to bed the scent would still be there faintly and i fall asleep to it it is fresh and strong at first then soft and sweet love it	14
0	i recently bought 3 items from this brand lumiscope actually this is the only item that works among them though i am kind of suspicious about it 's inconsistent readings from time to time i think braun irt452 is a much better product which i bought one for my parents in china during sars epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings	14
0	i bought this product with great expectations that it would save my not so inexpensive victoria secret bras from excessive wear in the washing machine it does do this though the product is not very user friendly when your bra is fairly large cupped i suppose if you have smaller cupped bras this device works wonderfully as for the larger dd or bigger cups you have to tuck and there is a large overlap on the smaller interior ball also another problem i have found is that the larger cups with underwire are really hard to use with this ball again due to the size of the larger cups otherwise i would think that this is a great product for use with smaller cupped bras	14
1	pik stik reacher grabber did exactly what it said i used the 32 in size to pick up items from the floor and in the yard i'm 5'4 and did not have to bend over to pick up things it picks up coins small pieces of paper as well as jars and leaves gumballs from outdoors i am completely satisfied	14
1	i bought this for my aged mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel i 'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle she adores the microfiber towels i got her ! they are light for her weak arms they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that 's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly not to mention that i a hearty creature in my prime love these towels too ! i shall be buying more of various styles and colors	14
0	this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair and that brings around another problem emjoi customer service and repair service you 'll want to avoid both better yet avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache not only are emjoi products cheap they are painful to use	14
0	enough single use garbage diapers are used in the u s each year to reach to the moon and back think about where they come from and where they go what kind of world do you want your kids to live in \? cloth diapers are not difficult and regardless of the propoganda of the garbage diaper companies they have no where near the negative environmental impact	14
1	this is a great barber style setup it comes with a lot of guides and has a little case they even give you a garbage bag good dea	14

1	it doesnt quit dark circles but helps against wrinkles while it is on your face	14
0	it puts out a cloud of water vapor and it 's not all that noisy but i had no idea i 'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart wiping it down trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down refilling the tank twice a day and wondering why this humidifier does n't have an automatic shuftoff in case i forget to turn it off at least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find however this is too much like an unwanted hobby so i 'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room	14
1	this is a great heating pad if you like heat it ranges from low to hi with 4 settings in between \( that is 6 settings \) especially nice is the loooooong cord my old heating pad has like a 6 ft cord and i always needed an extension cord for it good purchase !	14
1	the foot massager is great it 's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like the massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit the massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt raise lower and etc the only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it so keeping it upright can be a bit challenging but for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet	14
0	bought this hoping for a good amount of steam for facials and sinus problems hardly any steam comes out and there are too many little pieces and parts not worth the at all i'm back to boiling a large pot of water for steam	14

1	this heating pad wraps around stays put does a perfect job and turns off by itself spend the money and get a better mousetrap	14
0	i bought one and it worked great at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot but once you get used to it it does a stellar job of straightening your hair around 6 months into using the straightner the machine slowly overheated and died thinking i had a faulty model i went out and bought a new one guess what \? a few months into that one it ended the same way so basically not worth it	14
1	bought it works really good such a fun thing to have laying around and was very pleased well worth the 50 it costed me at brookstone	14
1	que maravilla comprar por amazon com todo llego en perfecto estad	14
0	advil liquigels are excellent for headaches i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks \( as advertised \) i ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store \( like i had to eventually do when i ran out \)	14
0	they have to be lubricated several times during a hair cut my hair is very short and this is unusual if you do not go over every area of your head at least 5 times you will have tiny haris sticking out i spent more on these clippers thinking they would be better i would have been better buying a cheap pair at walmart which i normally do	14

1	i love the medi beads products and highly recommend them although not as comfortable as the pliable elasto gel i love the moist heat and the weight of the pads i used them therapeutically both for myself and for massage therapy clients i only wish they made a longer one to cover the entire back but 2 of the king sized pads will do it microwave time will vary according to the power of your microwave	14
0	i recommend using ear plugs or ear muffs protection before using the andis company 22560 rechargeable cord cordless hair clipper kit	14
0	was excited about this after reading the reviews but it is so small and imho did not produce enough moisture in the air to warrant the pricetag after buying it and trying it i went out and bought a larger one barely ever use this	14
1	it 's pretty good do n't see it making anything firmer but it works nicely as a moisturizer i checked the internet and apparently the person posting stuff above has been posting the same thing about it ruining their life all over the net probably an allergic reaction you always have to test a little piece of skin before slopping something in your eyes	14
1	i loved it and guys really love it the smell is so fresh and clean	14
1	i was very happy with the prpduct and the shipping was very quick even in the middle of the holidays i will probably order another 3 inch memory foam from allsleep for my queen size bed	14
0	this item is garbage i purchased it about a month ago and already dumped it in the trash sure it looks and sounds good but take it from me it 's not worth the frustratio	14
0	i thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where i do n't want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth but contrary to what 's promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses which ended up dirtier than they started the wipes work okay on a computer screen though	14

1	these batteries work well they do n't last as long as normal batteries but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs if you have kids with toys these are a must	14

0	i'm a huge fan of the pria line but these are not like the others they are heavier and a little grainy i do n't hate them but will not buy them again the flavor is pretty good though just not what i was expecting i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind thank	14
0	i like this hairdryer when it works ! it has broken twice on me the first time it starting spitting out sparks so i sent it back they sent me a new one \( of course i had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back \) and now it only works on low the high is broken i am going to throw it out and get a different brand not impressed !	14

1	this razor is fantastic the gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad ! ! the only problem i had with it was the gel parts do n't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream gel would but if you are looking for a quick handy and yet still good shave this is exactly what you are looking for	14
0	i bought myself this book light after giving someone a 5 robotic book light from walgreens when she used hers it lit up the room when i got mine today i tried it out and it barely lit up the palm of my hand had to smack it twice when the light flickered off to get it to come back on it is flimsy the light is dim and it 's not worth the wait go to walgreens instead mine is now lighting up the bottom of the trash can	14

1	i just bought a vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high i needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet these goggles are awesome ! they fit perfectly inside my helmet and because the wrap around my head they stay put the magnets in front are very strong so the goggles do n't move the eye cups are just the right size and they 're padded for comfort these goggles have far exceeded my expectations	14
1	i purchased this for my husband he hates to shave everyday and now he can without the razor burn it is even as close a shave as if he used a razor ! i saw it on the consumers number one pick for foil shavers and i am glad i went with their reccomendation	14

0	when i ordered this item i assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use actually each flosser is a plastic prong with pre strung floss in it to be used once and discarded let me see a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365 000 000 plastic doodads added to the world 's landfills every year i already compromise my principles for convenience more than i 'd like to admit this is totally over the top when i 've used up my supply of flossers out this thing goes it goes into the landfill to be sure so do n't anyone else make my mistake	14
1	the best sports bar around great taste organic contains plenty of antioxidants and contains a good amount of protein the only down side is the high amount of carbs especially the sugars but i still give it five stars	14

0	my rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set regardless of me using more or less hair maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio if so it is impossible to find i dunno but i do know i would not recommend these also even when i get these to stay in my hair my hair does n't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers overall buy something else	14
0	i was disappointed getting this product because i 've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron i actually prefer the cheaper conair 's ceremanic irons w o the wet on off feature over this one it does n't clamp down well on my hair \( i 've got thick frizzy hair \) the results for me are n't that great it straightens my hair a little but it 's still frizzy it 's lightweight which is nice i do n't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair i definitely prefer other models over this one	14
0	like the reviewer below my dryer also stopped working within a short period it was never dropped or misused after about a month it simply refused to turn on when plugged in now there is a decent warranty for the product however with the money you spend on shipping and the 4 they request for handling return shipping buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal i do n't know if the other reviewer and i got the only two lemons but since we both found our way to amazon with this review i would n't recommend the product to other buyers	14
0	it worked fine for 2 3 weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my short hair and it would just stop i had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together very frustrating go get a professional dryer it might cost a bit more but it 'll work ! and probably for a long time	14
1	i have pergo and cannot get it too wet or the floor will bubble the swiffer wet cloths are the perfect solution they 're so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you 're done i hate that i'm consuming a product that is so disposable but at the same time it works so well	14
1	i love this razor it gives a nice close shave is easy to clean and can be used wet or dry nothing to complain about here	14
0	this is the most innacurate thermometer i have ever come across each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more moreover the battery only lasts for 1 2 uses granted one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature but you would think the battery could last a few more times when you have a sick child accuracy and time are of the essence	14
0	the first time i tried to use this tool the spring came off and would not reattach the screw holding the spring on was defective what a dissappointment ! !	14
1	i have used the unit for about two weeks with nimh rechargable batteries installed and it performs as advertised there is in my opinion a design flaw the start stop button acts as the power on off function and is easily depressed at unwanted times e g putting into or removing from the case they could should have included an ac adapter	14
0	this product is worthless save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank i'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in	14

1	i have had omord hr 100c for a few months now i use it wile on my treadmill it seems to take a wile before it starts to register the hart rate i think it is because the sending unit needs some moisture to make good contact with your skin i did have some trouble with the unit when i first started using it i replaced the battery in the sending unit which solved the problem the fact that the battery is user replaceable is one of the main reasons i picked the omord brand the hr 100c is a bare bones unit and does a good job if you are looking for an inexpensive basic hart rate monitor	14
1	i have gotten numerous compliments on this eau de toilette it has a light almost woodsy smell reminds me of a laid back saturday at the country club or something classy yet sporting	14
1	i 've been using nicads for long long time and while in some applications the alkaline might last somewhat longer the money saved after just a couple of recharges is worth the extra expense of buying twice as many as one needs and just keep on recycling the batteries from flash units gps walkie talkie 's flashlights etc however these newer nimh are just great no memory shelf and longer current life nicads and alkaline 4 stars these do get a	14
1	i use these almost every morning they 're hot and ready to go in seconds i like the nonslip surface of the curlers makes it so easy to set my hair remove and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style i like having 12 large rollers to handle my thick long hair these rollers rock	14
1	i bought this to go with my ms2 200bpt shaver i saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well i 've been using it for about 1 month and i could n't agree more a quick spray on the cutters after shaving and the next time i use it it runs like new i can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since i 've started using it as a bonus it seems to last quite a while another strong product from remington	14
0	very simple review the hair dryer worked fine for a little over a month then it did n't save your box if you buy this you may need to return it	14
0	it 's ok that helps to moisturize the skin but it 's just stays oily and cannot be absorbed appropriately in the skin	14
1	i agree with the previous reviewer i have used this brush for years ! it was recommended to me by a hairdresser and i will never use a different brush unless you have fine thin hair you will love this brush ! ! !	14
0	its super cheap does not work at all will struggle with the thinnest of hairs stay away ! !	14
1	i got what i expected it 's functional and not too poorly made the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great the rolling wheels still have no function for me but they do n't get in the way	14
0	this is not my first facial sauna but it is the worst i 've used the cold function does not work well \( not significantly enough at least \) but the hot function works fine it tends to leak the water you put in even if you keep it below the max fill line	14
0	i was just given this set new and was impressed by the reviews i'm not sure if it 's just my hair but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer i figured i needed to work out the kinks and give it another try again same look and that 's all the curl i have after 20 minutes concept is good just does n't work on my fine full head of hair if you want curl stick to the hot rollers	14
0	this item did n't work very well it was n't a close shave at all i used it twice before my dog chewed it up it left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it	14
0	these bars arrive smashed melting and stale taste like cardboard with dried blueberrie jam spread around on them awfu	14
1	this is a great drink i wanted to try something that was different and this definately fit in it isnt carbonated and tastes really good what i really wanted to know though was how it worked there is no caffeine or taurine and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary it worked well though and i was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it	14
0	ewww ewww get it off get it off ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! omigod i loved hugo so much i 've been anticipating this in the mail and bought the shower gel from a different source as well this is just terrible i'm taking a shower look for my posting of this cheap i 've already taken a loss i have reviewed many colognes take a look at them i like most of them	14
0	i would like to give 0 stars i 've got one battery for more than 8 with s h they say 12 batteries do not make the same mistake i made they will send you only one battery not 12	14
1	these are the best diapers i have used they are soft flexible and easily adjustable for a good secure fit they hold leaks extremely well of course leaks do occur \( why would n't they if your baby has say for example 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes it 's happened \) however this is to be expected they do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection i highly recommend these	14
0	i would give it negative stars but that was n't an option this thing is horrible does n't cut very close certainly does n't hold a charge engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes and oh yeah the horrible razor burn ! ! ! seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams	14
0	i really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that i'm not too happy about the filter does n't lock down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out the filter plops out of the top causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher it 's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it 's worth the other brita pitcher i have the filter locks into place and does n't do this	14
0	i had ordered this item expecting good things from it however the article has never worked properly the electrical system seems to be working fine but the uv light has never come on somehow it seems pointless to have a toothbrush sanitizer that does not sanitize right now the product is only a toothbrush holder nothing more i generally do not pay such a high price for a toothbrush holder i have been in contact with the producer of the product and hope to have something done about it in short i wo n't buy anything like this again	14
0	i got this as a gift for my husband he used it for about 3 weeks but still had red marks and had to follow up afterwards with a regular disposable razor the whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and was n't as good luckily braun had a 30 day money back guarantee so we were able to return it \( minus shipping x 2 \)	14
0	please take this horrible misrepsentation off of your web site or at the very least practice honesty in advertising this unit is so small that all it good for is ties shorts and socks i feel violated by amazon and conair	14
0	this is the best diet product ever ! i tried them all and skinny water \? is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever the product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much i drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away i lost 15 lbs in 20 days great taste it works great and it 's so inexpensive great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight the owners should hire me to do commercials for them	14
0	i have always thought that a man 's shaver would work on woman 's beard this one does not	14
0	do not buy this iron it 's fabulous while it works for which it does merit the one star but it broke in less than a week it overheated or something and then would n't turn on again but here 's the kicker if you buy it from amazon the company wo n't honor the warranty i do n't have particularly heavy duty hair this is just totally unacceptable	14
0	paid a fortune for this thing and it stopped working after 2 uses	14
0	i had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews i used the razor as directed in the instruction manual the manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use i used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse i had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal do not buy this product	14
1	i got this product when the price dropped down to 12 so for that price i liked this product a lot it heats the lotion well initially i thought it was small but now i think it is the correct size i did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this i switch it on when i go for a bath and by the time i am back the lotion is ready and warm it is a great buy and for all you bargain shoppers wait till the price drops it is especially a great buy during winter	14
0	the only thing that i have really used out of it has been the nail clippers otherwise i wasted the money on it and could have put it towards something more useful well i guess you and learn it was my first baby everything looks great and needed	14
1	easy to use and a wicked incentive to lose weight have lost 20 kilos in just a few months from walking	14
1	i lost six pounds in eleven days i started out taking one half pill in the morning and one half in the afternoon i was wary of any reaction i now take one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon that 's enough for me i have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise no side effects whatsoever my problem was the munchies at night watching tv and that craving is gone i highly recommend this product	14
1	safari by ralph lauren for women is the only eau de parfum my niece uses after she discovered safari she gave away her collection of purfumes i usually try to find safari for her birthday every year	14
0	if you get it wet it stops working which is quite ironic given its a toothbrush if you want something to work for a month or two its fine otherwise avoid it entirely i intitally thought the water was effecting the battery compartment but after cleaing the contacts and replacing the batteries it seems clear to me that the motor fails due to moisture pretty quickly after ordinary use	14
1	10 bucks and does the job you do need to adjust it every once in awhile but that 's easy to do	14
0	i am a male i did a search and this item showed up for men however it is way too long for a man unless he is yao ming it looked like i was wearing a skirt and came down several inches below my knees i am 5'10 tall also the light wieght microfiber terry was a drawback it clings to you and builds up a lot of static electricity i will not ever buy another product made of this material	14
1	this is a great shaver if you are in the market for one considered the remington r 960 i am of afro american descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver i had always gotten excellent results using remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug with its ergonomic design it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas i had considered purchasing that of another brand until i discovered that remington makes one and now i'm loving it	14
0	the ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time i put it in the freezer ! evidently the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed ! in addition to that my soup was luke warm at lunchtime	14
0	like the fading in of light would like the sound effects if they worked ! out of box the sound effects did not work now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace such a hassle	14
0	it does let you shake and mix up the protein well but no matter how tightly you screw the cap on liquid gets all around the edge and in the threads then as soon as you put it down it all runs down the sides and leaks everywhere it 's a horribly cheap and leaky design i would look elsewhere or just be prepared with a lot of paper towels every time you use it \( and if you find a good one that does n't leak please post the info here and let me know \) thanks	14
0	my wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray with all of the snow we have had it arrived shortly after christmas but just in time to warm her heart for the new year	14
1	pink sugar is a wonderful scent i have received many compliments on this fragrance its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey it is however a sweet scent everyone i know that has this fragrance loves it at this price 32 14 for 3 4 oz spray you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that i say buy it you cannot go wrong	14
0	this one 's going back to the store it has been turned on for almost half an hour and i barely feel the heat if you ask me my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat as for the massage it 's worthless to me but i am not one for vibrating massage anyway i prefer shiatsu i get cold feet when i am home and not moving around a lot so i think i will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet	14
1	this is the 2nd year that i have used the neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunblock spf 45 i have normal to oily sensitive acne prone skin i am fair and can burn easily i think this product is well worth the money it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel it does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out i apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours the time will vary depending on your sun tolerance though it is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile	14
0	meditation will do the same thing buy a tape or take a class	14
0	this product would be excellent but runs fully 4 too narrow and 3 too short this creates an aprox 2 lip around the entire matress very odd this short coming disturbs the experience substantially the laminated back works well be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine	14
1	this scale was easy to understand and measures the same as my doctors office easy to monitor weight and fat	14
0	i am now going through what everyone else is talking about finding replacement bulbs for 20 this is unfortunatelyfor some a throw away mirror at least ours lasted morethan 4 weeks	14
1	there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments i am glad i did the light from the mirror is bright the slide bar for the different light settings works very well if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out	14
0	i was quite pleased with this alarm clock until recently when i found that it was consistently waking me up one hour early i tried fiddling with the dst setting and then changing the alarm and clock times just a little but without fail it would wake me an hour earlier than i wanted the brightness may be a problem for some people but i found it reasonable overall a good docking station but a poor alarm clock	14
0	the shampoo works fine but it has a very different smell that i was not expecting it smells kind of woodsy spicy	14
0	i really dun know if i was expecting too much out of this machine but its not really that great there are just one or two sounds that u may like like the running stream heartbeat tropical forest etc the rest of them like the ocean waves rainfall thunderstorm white noice etc pretty much dont let u sleep also someone complained here about the alarm what alarm \? \? \? \? \? thats a different model which is about 20 this one is just the sounds which sound artificial if u are expecting a more natural sound move on this one is more like a radio with too much static !	14
1	i have been very satisfied with the monitor it is easy to use and seems to be quite accurate i was disappointed to find when i opened the box that there were no instructions included a quick phone call had them on the way i was able to use it without the instructions but could not set the time etc all in all it is a quite satisfactory device	14
0	had to return this b p cuff could not get it to work properly medical devices need to be made a great deal better than this one	14
0	i bought this press to do crafts the dimensions i were given were completely wrong i was told the product in inches \( l x w x h \) 9 0 x 20 0 x 15 0 it really is barely 6 1 2 inches wide and a little over 12 inches long 17 inces long at the angle it was so small that i could maybe iron one sock at a time also the green light never came on after 1 hour of warming up and real waste of money and very misleading picture on the amazon website	14
1	i am very pleased with the light output i purchased them to light the inside of my childs playhouse they really iluminate the inside as bright as a standard light bulb i purchased a couple of years ago an earlier type lanturn by rayovac and was really pleased with it also	14
0	so yeah it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups and once it 's mounted it stays put pretty well unfortunately it has so far never actually been fogless get a good shower going and the mirror fogs up in record time splash some water on it and you can see yourself for half a minute but overall this is a disappointment	14
1	i took my unit to a monthly meeting for seniors their machine broke i took mine as a replacement they liked it so well they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings they like all the different aspects of the machine a suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet write down the date the numbers from the machine \?	14
1	i 've only had this scale for a short time but so far so good i 've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money as someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often i specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason with an inexpensive digital scale which is what i had last you ca n't reset it like you can an analog this scale is a great buy for only 10 how can you go wrong !	14
1	i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves it she is able to do her nail easily the nail attachments work really well and strong the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone compact size easy to store and quick charge time	14
1	i am very satisfied with nizoral anti dandruff shampoo many anti dandruff shampoos tend to make my hair feel dry or rough i have thick waist length hair and nizoral got rid of the dandruff and left it feeling soft and easy to manage unlike some anti dandruff shampoos that have a medicinal smell nizoral has a pleasant fragrance i 'll definitely use this product any time i need a dandruff shampoo	14
1	the roller balls are excellent ! the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow it is abrasive to the skin i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly other than that it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many	14
1	this creatine works very good on me building muscle it has no flavor i recommend it with a good diet ! ! see results in weeks !	14
1	i bought this bag for my husband as a surprise \( as i had bought another brand and he did not like the asian floral print \) it 's very roomy looks great fits ergonomically i really love the pocket design and the space that they have as well as the interior design fits things better than my own bag ! my husband loves it and ca n't wait to use it ! plus that this is the best price i 've seen online and of course amazon ships quickly and accurately	14
1	heats up fast rolls up easily \( does n't slip like old school hot rollers used to \) and stays on with the right hot roller clips depending on the look i'm looking for i use 4 or up to 8 rollers for my chin length fine hair keep them on for 10 minutes while i put on my makeup and voila ! soft strokeable voluminous hair	14
1	i got this unit as a gift from my boyfriend high blood pressure runs in my family so i wanted to get a monitor to keep track i was figuring on getting an arm unit but when i got this wrist unit i wanted to see how it would work the whole system is very easy to use and fast you need to be sitting and resting to take the reading but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you i did n't think i would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy i can say this was a great gift something i use a lot and something that will help me stay healthy	14
1	received my pack of 4 in 2 days with the free ship option shop rite sells individual box for 8 99 so even the regular price of 32 beat that the 10 additional promotion was icing on the cake	14
1	i bought this vaporizer several weeks ago i feel better after i use this it created steam very fast \( about 2 3 minutes after plugging \) you may have to fill some salt to make it create a lot of steam however a lot of steam means the water will decrease rapidly so if you want to use this vick for a long time \( about 12 20 hours \) you may not need to use salt	14
1	i originally ordered a tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks \( amazon of course took it back with no problems \) i was so glad when the omron scale arrived it costs less than the tanita but the quality is much higher the numbers on it are very large and easy to read also it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the tanita i ca n't wait to try all the features by the way i weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied 2 lbs as promised great deal for the money ! ! !	14
1	i love the olay regenerist line ! moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth you will see a big difference after the first use ! i 've been using this product for 2 years now and just recently started the serum and it 's great	14
1	i 've used this cream for years i like the way it feels and makes my skin look i 'd recommend it to anyone	15
0	it does n't smell woody to me at all well maybe a fake pinesol type of smell it smells really artificial and almost chemical y i guess it 's not so bad and some people might like it but i did n't	15
1	i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin bringing newer skin to the surface and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier i was a little wary a first but it works my skin feels softer and looks more even all around	15
1	i did my christmas shopping in my warm fluffy nightgown the package arrived before christmas i did not pay for gas for shopping i did not fight for a parking space and i did not stand in long lines to pay for my prize my mom 's favorite cologne was also at least 10 20 dollars cheaper then the big stores overhead pricing this is the way to go	15
1	wow ! shesheido has done it again ! i love thier products ! i have oily skin so i like to blot my face once a day the papers are awesome very soft they soak up the oil and i can tell after i throw the paper away usually 1 sheet a day is all i need and my face is shine free ! i love them ! i also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most i have seen so far i love this product and will buy again	15
1	this is for sure one of my new favorite sets the scent is nice and clean the lotion and gel left a very nice scent also	15
1	here 's a gem of an idea for a small gift or stocking stuffer for the preteen girls on your list a cute lip gloss ring from hard candy the ring is heart shaped with a flip top filled with a lightly tinted sparkly lip gloss it comes in three shades and glosses heartbreaker which is a peach kiss me which is hot pink and yummy which is baby blue all are fruit scented boxed in a ring box with a faceted lid \( presentation you know \) it 's finger fun	15
1	i love this soap ! it smells so fresh and my skin feels great after i wash with it ! i am definetely ordering more of this soap	15
0	i got very irresistible by givenchy perfume as a gift for christmas as first smell i loved it then i spritzed it and yikes ! that was 2 months ago and i still have the scent on me it 's too flowery it 's not a clean fresh scent more of a i sprayed a little too much potpouri in here scent not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either ! !	15
0	i love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel but this lotion is not getting as much love from me it does n't smell the same to me and on a bad day makes me a little sick it 's sweeter smelling thing is i need lotion and i do n't want competing scents otherwise i might have rated it even lower	15
0	i used to use tend skin it works ok but there are better things out there now tend skin is an outdated product like the sytptic pencil tend skin stings smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill i recently switched to min solution2 like it much better than tend skin min solution2 has a roller application \( no waste \) organic spearmint \( fresh smell \) and does n't burn like tend skin	15
1	this is an excellent product but i have a problem disguising the white look it leaves on my face at first i thought it was because i used too much but even when i use only a tiny amount it is still white it will certainly suit persons with pale complexions wish there was a tint to it	15
1	blackberry bath bomb is really relaxing it turns the water a pretty purple color and smells sleepily sweet it 's fairly moisturizing too	15
0	okay but does not keep cool for long i do like the massage effect from the beads	15
0	it does n't work for what we intended it for blackhead removal my teen son was really hoping this would help him and it did n't not only that but the safety cap for the lance end does n't stay on	15
1	i used many shower caps but this one is the best i recommend everyone to have it	15
1	great towel for the gym or after swimming very absorbant and i also use one to cover the circuit machines when i use them	15
0	this product works well when i use it with a curling iron the low rating is for the cost i just do n't think it is worth over 20	15
1	of all the other caswell massey scents i 've tried some are kind of old fashioned smelling high quality soaps in luxurious packaging not as long lasting as some other triple milled soaps i 've tried	15
1	obviously some people do n't care about reviewing an item just about bashing a pop artist that does n't deserve it anyway i think it smells great obviously it does or it would n't be the bestselling perfume right now but do n't take my word for it go to your nearest store and give it a sniff also be sure to check out fantasy i think it smells even better	15
0	if you have some respect for your nose please do n't buy these wipes ! ! ! i bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house ! ! ! and i would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby	15
1	i bought this as a gift for my head shaving husband he is very happy with his close shave and i have used it as well for my legs a tiny bit goes a long way and it provides a very close smooth shave the downside is the cost it 's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel	15
1	i havent gotten the treatment myself yet but my husband loves it dont rub it on too long or you 'll have too much it melts quickly when it touches skin i love the peppermint cinnamon mixture scent and he likes the heat it provides it leaves a coating of the buttery stuff on your skin so wear a shirt to bed so it can soak in and moisturize	15
0	i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours when i went back to get a lighter color it did the same i think there 's just too much yellow in this foundation and considering it 's oil free it did n't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you or if you 're looking for a similar oil free foundation i would highly recommend laura mercier oil free or chanel dpf	15
1	this is a wonderful addition to taking a bath ! the size is very nice quite large and makes for an awesome spa like exprerience in your own home ! the sponge is clean and has no smell rinses out easily ! highly recommend	15
1	i find these soaps to be very good there are actually 4 different kinds i believe one also for sensitive skin if someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type this soap is similiar to dhc soaps from japan if they are to drying try using the correct soap for help i would suggest going to the clinque counter or ask me	15
1	this is a really fun gift for children \( although you might have guessed that i like them too \) it has a sweet fruity scent without being a sugar buzz and the colors are very bright and cheerful i would suggest one of those wire or slotted soap dishes to help these dry easier and faster though a regular soap dish without any type of draining makes it melt faster	15
1	great salt scrub and it really does get warm on contact and leaves skin baby sooofft	15
0	i used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend my face esp my forehead became very greasy and every pore on my forehead became inflamed i thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina my face cleared up instantly when the aquamarina ran out i went back to herbalism but surprise the skin problems reemerged now i'm using aquamarina instead and love it though you ca n't get it through amazon for some reason check the lush website i'm sure this wo n't happen to everyone but give that pink glop a try instead	15
1	i bought this perfume for my husband and both of us love it very sexy and yet a clean scent at the same time it 's light enough to be perfect for the man who normally does n't wear perfumes yet elegant enough for the man who does	15
0	i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel fresh in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey nothing fresh about it	15
1	this is a really great scent but it could of been better i think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals i mean seriously animals want to smell nice too	15
1	i really enjoyed this bomb it was very refreshing and relaxing it is a big bomb and i could have broken it in half but i did n't want to risk missing a thing ! so far i have been happy with my lush purchases and my favorite bomb is sex bomb but i would buy this one again or give it as a gift	15
1	we really like this dish it allows soap and water to drain through you wo n't have the soap scum problem it looks great and has rubber on the bottom and it wo n't slide around on you	15
0	i ordered this march 17th and didnt recieve until april 5th ! ! it smelled horrible like a weird chalk chemical smell i called lush who said it was probably just a bad batch and to send it back at my own expense \( 5 \) this is after i waited forever to recieve and the product smells horrible im very mad at lush com and will not ever order anything from them again except for the angel delight soap pissedoff	15
1	i received the soku lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled ! the box itself is decorative and i re used it as a pencil holder on my desk the scent is very aromatic and long lasting i had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house i was very pleased	15
0	i have been on a search for the perfect mascara for many years now just as many of the reviewers had been i purchased this mascara based on the reviews and i am more than disappointed in the mascara i would not give you 2 cents for the product and would love to return it the mascara is clumpy and will not stick to the eyelash i do not mind paying 25 00 for a tube of mascara if it doe 's the job this one doe 's not i had better luck with max factor clinque etc	15
1	this product actually works as described it helped significantly improve the appearance of a scar created by a chemical burn within 2 weeks the scar is still visible but has lightened a number of shades and feels smoother i highly recommend this produc	15
1	i love this conditioner ! it smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk ! my hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour regardless i recommend this product highly especially for dry damged hair i recommend this product in conjunction with new ! \( hair \) solid shampoo bar also made by lush cosmetics	15
1	i thought this stuff smelled fantastic and very similar to a lavender poundcake i guess smell is very subjective though so if you 're not sure about this one you might want to have a sniff at your local sephora or department store before purchasing	15
0	this product might be better on oily skin with no make up the point of it was lost on me it may create a barrier between treatment products moisturizer and make up but it did nothing to perfect my skin in fact when i touched my face i could feel make up pilling and rolling off it has a dry heavy feeling to it do n't use too much and be careful about dry patches i thought it would make a better canvas of my skin i now use laura mercier 's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow i did n't like the formulation of philosophy 's product at all	15
0	might be a great product i ca n't be sure because uh hello \? mine did n't come with any instructions whatsover i opened it up and i was like ah hello \? where are the instructions \? but the tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze did not answer my questions if anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions i would greatly appreciate it until then my tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze is just gonna sit there not being used like my box of floss a bag of onions and my heart	15
0	i like jonathan anton some of his products but this one was a very bad one it smelled like swamp water his other products smell great i do n't know what happened to this one	15
0	listen up ! ! ! l'occitane shea 24 hour ultra rich face cream 1 7 ounce has the same moisturizing results for a fraction of the cost ! ! ! \)	15
1	this mascara is great i 've tried many and this is the only one that does n't smudge all over the place the only drawback is the price it 's triple what drugstore brands cost	15
1	like most others i fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years i had to buy the latest greatest design in razors with each new design the blades got more and more expensive until i realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money about a year ago i bought a merkur razor and have not regretted it if you are a newbie to this type of razor you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique then enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket	15
1	i have tried so many products b c i have tiny laugh lines and i am so not ready for them yet this product has helped beyond belief ! i love it ! ! ! i wanted to write a review because beauty products are very expensive and i wanted to say save your money and do n't buy anything but kinerase if you want results ! it is awesome ! !	15
0	i have been using this product for about a month and all it 's done is given me puffy eyes there is no proof that this product works at all and the fda has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles i 've used botox before and believe me botox works this product does n't so obviously it 's not better than botox i bet the people who gave it 5 stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the basic research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is	15
1	i have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side the problem with most conditioners i 've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it they are very heavy and weigh my hair down i found out about kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at amazon it 's wonderful doing everything i need including making my hair nice and shiny without the heaviness i recommend it highly	15
1	if there is a better shaving cream out there i could n't find it i 've not had any problems and a year later i'm still on my first purchase with about 40 left fantastic stuff	15
1	i'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color i would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil this is a perfect neutral color i subtracted one star because iprefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush i think it looks more natural brenda christian makes a brow powder which i prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powderi can find sometimes i mix the two i start with the pencil and add a bit of powder all all it 's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils	15
0	this item smells like lemon pine sol it is not what you think you are paying for its not worth the money	15
1	i used to use mac 's glass lipgloss before juicy tubes were around any time the wind blew i had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which as you know is extremely unpleasant and annoying juicy tubes stays on but does n't have the overly sticky feeling which is wonderful i do n't wear much makeup and find juicy tubes to add that something special to a dewy face i recommend daiquiri or berry bold for the most natural looks daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while berry bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally you will adore this gloss i ca n't live without it	15
1	i got the gift box i love it it smells very modern and you can layer it with a sugar or a vanilla to make your own blend it smells money because it is so sophisticated i love how it wears it gets nicer as the evening goes on i like that in a scent	15
1	i absolutely fell in love with this fragrance it smells like a day at the county fair absolutely lovely you have to layer it though to make it last wash with the shower gel put on the body lotion first thing when you get out of the shower or bath \( perfumes stick better that way while you 're moist \) and then spray if you wash your hair spray while your blow drying it out carry the spray in your purse you will need to touch up during the day	15
0	this shampoo made my hair flat and dry when i used it every day so i tried using another shampoo and used jonathan 's once a week the one day i used jonathan shampoo my hair was noticably flat and dull i ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo what a disappointment	15
1	if you want an spf that is strong light non greasy and does n't smell this is definitely it i am addicted and will never use anything else	15
0	i do not like this shampoo at all in fairness i did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair it seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet the one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which i do love did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well	15
1	this is the only blemish treatment that i have ever tried that will get rid of anything ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down you can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up it isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though it is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face it 's a little pricey but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year	15
0	well i dint like the smell at all i see nothing lovely about this perfum if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season check out fantasy by britney spears it smells so nice or curious by britney thats a classic its a must give or have j lo 's live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present or for urself its not really worth ur money !	15
0	i just received my conditioner today and it 's going back to sephora i do n't know how this can be called a conditioner because it 's nothing more than water it also smells nothing like vanilla the only scent i could smell was coconut and i do n't want my hair smelling like that	15
1	i 've tried all types of eyeliner and they all end up smudging or flaking off very messy by the end of a long day \( or night \) i bought this one to wear at my wedding \( in the fantastic chocolate shade \) and it was absolutely perfect ! well worth the price great wear easy to apply \( with a very skinny tipped brush i ended up using a tiny paintbrush \) and stays exactly where you put it	15
1	i use this constantly i 've bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at sephora i do n't blend it in though i dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry not too much but it 's still so vibrant that a little goes a long way i 've reccomended this to everyone	15
1	i am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss i own over 300 different brands of gloss and this is by far one of my favorites it 's a pretty good deal at only 28 for so many colors i like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket it 's fun to layer the different colors as well and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors they also taste amazing each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar it goes especially well with the aquolina pink sugar fragrance for a sugar themed cosmetic experience	15
1	not your typical thick floral smelling perfume this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises like lemon juice mixed with sugar it 's a seasonal perfume \( i ca n't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter \) it smells very crisp fresh and clean which i enjoy a lot but i imagine others would not the same things i like about this perfume could smell like a cleaning product to others go to your fridge get a lemmon squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar if you enjoy the smell you get buy this perfume i highly recommend it if not stick to something more traditional and vanilla floral like ana sui 's dolly girl	15
1	this product is the best of this type i 've ever used i would recommend it	15
1	do n't be afraid to smile and do n't cover up those smile lines you can eliminate them with this amazing product from clinique	15
1	this is absolutely the best concealer ever i have skin that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts with face makeup this stuff has n't been a problem ! it stays put all day long and does not shine	15
1	love love love this scent i have received many compliments about it long lasting and definitely addictive i think its more of a late fall and winter scent if i do say so myself	15
1	i purchased this item for my boyfriend and he loves it it is a great lower end badger hair brush it also conveniently transforms as a metal cylinder for easy travel	15
1	the powder foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large pored it is one of the best around for no caking no oil smooth surface skin if you ca n't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations chanel does it best ! ! also my seller was terrific	15
1	i have hard facial hairs \( thanks dad ! ! \) and after being gilette user \( last used mac 3 \) i finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with double edge \( de \) razor and blades merkur are the first ones i have used after the multi edge blades and after 4 5 shaves i am getting closer shaves \( w no irritation \) than by using mutli edge ones also to get better results i would recommend a badger brush which really softens the skin before these de blades with a good heavy razor \( merkur is a good one \) can smoothly get your facial stubs good luck !	15
1	i 've been using touche eclat ever since it came out i still love it cannot believe how rested i look after i put this on my dark circles are minimized i look radiant till now no other concealer can beat ysl 's touche eclat ca n't live without this product !	15
1	i have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck that dream cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks i 've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after i get out of the shower on my legs it has completely gotten rid of the red bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter i 've tried dozens of body lotions creams and this is my absolute favorite	15
1	someone turned me on to this eye cream and it 's been like getting an extra hour of sleep a night ever since the best trick \? keep it in the fridge apply after you shower you can feel it tightening away	15
1	i have dry unmanagable curly hair and rehab has done wonders for it ! because all the lush shampoos do n't contain any silicones it takes about one or two weeks for your hair to get used to it the squeeky feeling described in the other review is because of the lack of silicones this feeling disappears however when your hair dries up since i use rehab my hair is bouncy soft and shiny especially great in combination with american cream conditoner \( just love that scent !	15
1	after hearing so many good things about philosophy 's cinnamon buns i just had to try it out for myself i found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns but more like water mixed with sugar if you use it on your head it will leave a lingering smell but it wo n't last long on your body after taking a shower i think this product is a nice way of treating yourself but i definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns which left me slightly disappointed overall a great product	15
0	i have worked with two women who have worn this perfume and frankly i ca n't stand the smell of it it does n't even smell like perfume it is like some bizarre animal musk there are no floral notes and no woodsy notes either nothing clean or fresh or pleasant i wish this perfume did n't exist i hate it	15
1	almost immediately after using this face mask the redness in my face was gone it helps with a number or skin problems and i have sensitive skin so it 's hard to find a product that wo n't hurt me most facial masks cause a minor chemical burn this left my face beautifully soft if you 're unsure of this product or wavering at all let me tell you that you should buy it it 's amazing	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
0	i really do not feel tend skin works as advertised the irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed one good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning tend skin helps for that ! just take a strong whiff and you 'll be alert and ready for your day !	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
0	i used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months while i thought it moisturized fine i did not notice any change in my lines tone texture for the money i 'd go get several tubes of the neutrogena anti aging products they work better have a nicer texture and smell much better	15
1	covers great \( i have read splotches \) and is good for my skin cannot recommend it highly enough	15
1	the pores of the face become clogged with makeup cremes sunscreens bronzing gels powders etc exfoliation washing facials steaming do not remove blackheads whiteheads and clogged pores this simple product gets them out ! buying one will last a life time no need to buy another ever the ultimate cleaning device	15
1	this shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure badger bristle shaving brush i 've now been using it for a year and a half and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market the brush head remains densely packed and quite soft hopefully it will remain that way for some time to come in the meantime i do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush because of it i have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel they just ca n't compare to your average 1 50 cake of shaving soap and this brush this was a very worthwhile purchase for me	15
1	i could n't say if this diminished wrinkles or puffyness but it 's fab for great feeling eyes the whole area is velvety smooth and skin feels as soft as silk	15
0	love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product ! well this one used to have about 3 five star ratings i added my two cents this product did nothing for me whatsoever so some people love it i do n't get it and it 's pretty much the opposite of an anti oxidant so that does n't make sense i pointed this out in my review wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough \? also it 's listed at 45 on amazon as well from the same supplier huh	15
0	if you 're really looking forward to brightening your blonde go to the salon and ask for a non ammonia hair lightening or use an otc temporary product chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color the expense of this product is not justified by the results and while lush likes to toot its horn about being natural that designation could apply to arsenic it 's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives the parabens	15
1	got perfume for my wife she loves it me too of course	15
1	this is not a strong floral fragrance and not sweet but it smells wonderful it just gets better and better on your skin very complex very different	15
1	you can feel the huge difference when you put it on it 's really good for normal to oily skin everytime i have a big pimple i put a tiny drop on it before i sleep next day the big pimple almost disappears it 's a magic cosmaetic i will recommand to everyone	15
1	i discovered the murad acne complex kit about six years ago and have been using it since it cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away some products i tried dried my skin out but murad acne complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells i recommend anyone with acne try murad acne complex to see if it will work as well for you	15
0	i bought this stuff because i heard it helped with razor burn my husband likes me to shave a bit more often than i liked well too bad for him ! ! the pain from putting this stuff on was way worse than any sort of razor burn ! no thanks !	15
1	even swimming for two hours in the pool i still have mascara when i emerge from the water would not be without this !	15
1	this is a life changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing you just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow and it provides a perfect base twelve hours later the shadow is still perfectly in place i bought this at a neiman marcus store but the product is so good i wanted to make sure i rated it online so others would know how great it is !	15
0	why did shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub par spf \? they got the broad spectrum part correct by using avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred spf 15 uva uvb spf 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists the skin cancer foundation the american academy of dermatology and others plus as a moisturizer this one is just ok there are far better formulations on the market even some made by shiseido containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients	15
1	i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it in beige i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage fast shippin	15
1	beauty is hard work and savvy and so is this product you 'll find your fresh alluring face that 's been hiding since you were a young child	15
0	when i first spray inis energy of the sea cologne spray i could not smell any thing ! then i spray more and more 'till i found out how it smells ! it has nice scent okay i 'll tell you how i found it it is not bad ! but despite that it does n't last for more than half an hour and then it hardly can be smelled you may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour this is what disappointed me the most ! i am telling you my taste here that is n't necessarily yours	15
1	i absolutely love clinique for eye shadow all of their eye shadows go on so smooth never crease and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone the almost peach color is great because i can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base either way i use it just about every day !	15
1	my wife bought this lipstick in spain and was happy to find that she could purchase it in the u s also it 's the perfect color for her and does n't smudge	15
1	i experianced a small problem that was completly resolved to my satisfaction what a great company to do buisness with	15
1	i use the dusty pink and i have never ever used a blush that looks so natural and makes my skin glow so healthy with or without the mineral foundation from youngblood just lovely highly recommended	15
0	i ordered this product for my wife 3 weeks before christmas with several other philosophy items they shipped this was backordered i 've sent three messages to them and have not heard a sinlge response terrible aparently customer services is not a philosophy this company subscribes to i have gone ahead and filed a formal complaint through amazon you are probably better off buying their products at a brick and mortar store their online presence is unreliable at best	15
1	it is a very good conditioner it is light and yet conditioning but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish it smells distinctively barnyard but i see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me	15
1	this one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences it 's not too spicy not sickeningly sweet it 's not trying to do too much just effortless one thing i like about this you 're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses i hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air this one has restraint staying power is debatable but it 's such a wonderful confident woman scent i gave it 5 stars	15
1	this candle is the ultimate pleasure ! it 's smell is not over powering but is pleasurable at the same time you will be sure to love it as much as i do !	15
0	after using this product i felt less than fresh then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	15
1	this is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp very light and smells great	15
1	i got this perfume in a set of 4 ohter perfumes from estee lauder this one is really special so good light i loved this perfume more than all the others that i got in the set pleasures was one of them	15
1	very good product and great kind of fruity smell leave hair soft and full of bounce easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long the price here is still more expensive than in europe around 22 euros	15
1	great product from a company that only offers innovative wonderful products this product should n't cost this much though it costs less at authorized bb retail outlets and buying bb products online does n't guarantee the consumer that they 're getting authentic bb so beware check out www bumbleandbumble com for authorized retailers	15
0	i paid 100 00 for a tube of hylexin because i have serious dark circles unfortunately i fell for the hype because i would have tried anything that says significantly reduces dark circles ! i followed the directions and waited nothing ! i teach business ehtics at a university part of the course involves ethics in advertising i use the hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording the packaging etc please take my word for it and save yourself some money	15
1	well for startes this is one of the best cologes out there the smell is chrisp and will last a long time it is a great cologne for any acasion i have many colognes and this one is on the top of my list very masculine but girls love it ! ! ! !	15
1	this product is wonderful for individuals with very dry skin i usually apply this cream right before i put my foundation on and it works very well together it leaves my skin feeling very moist without it being sticky in addition to that it 's got a luscious cucumber smell to it i would highly reccomend this product to those who are seeking to get rid their moisture thirsting skin although it may be alittle costly it will last you about 4 months	15
1	i bought this conditioner for my daughter 's hair the smell is wonderful ! ! ! plus the product works great ! ! ! it now comes with a pump at least mine did which makes it easy to use it leaves my aa daughter 's hair soft and managable	15
1	made my skin smooth and very clean i loved the minty smell will definitely buy it agai	15
0	i'm a huge fan of the majority of the philosophy line along with adoring the amazing grace scent ! i thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent boy was i wrong ! ! if you love amazing grace this smells nothing like it it smells like plastic flowers not appealing at all even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic if you want a fantastic exfoliator try gingerbread man or the margarita scrub those are devine ! i think i 'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on	15
1	i use renergie microlift active redefining treatment as a preconditioner prior to the placement of foundation on my face i cannot imagine using anything else i find it challenging to find a product that allows my foundation to go on silky smooth yet without feeling greasy or causing blemishes i am in my fourties and this is the best product i have found	15
1	i suffered from a severe case of shingles that affected the right side of my face the infection left scars on half of my face i started using the exfoliate kit regularly after four months my face now looks normal and i'm able to go without makeup again thanks philosophy	15
1	no wonder this is a bestseller ! the results are highly visible and real fast i noticed a change in my skin 's pigmentation just a few days after using it highly effective i recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality product and tired of just fancy labels and marketing	15
1	i 've used paris hilton perfume for about a year now ordering it online at amazon was terrific i did n't have to drive and the price is half the amount you would spend in the department store ! ! ! if you have n't tried this fragrance please do so you will be wonderfully surprised at how special it makes you feel ! donna	15
1	i am a true believer in the phrase if it is not broke dont fix it its hard to improve on perfection keep up the good work until next time ! mike michalsk	15
0	try bill 's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding bill 's sliver gripper tweezers they are simply the best easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned and amazon has them	15
1	i bought this mostly because of how obsessed i am with pink sugar this product smells sweet it smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house i personally think of this as a good thing i love candy food scents my perfume collection is such that i am suprised i'm not followed everywhere i go by a swarm of bees if you 're looking for a sophisticated scent please do n't buy this or pink sugar if you are looking to have people ask hey do you smell a delicious cake \? everytime you walk past buy away and who does n't want to smell like a delicious cake \?	15
1	i am seeing results after three weeks i love this stuff	15
1	i have shoulder length natural dredlocs and while this did n't lock my hair it did smooth out the flyaways around the crown of my head it also has a great light scent that does n't compete with the other hair care products i use like the vanila leave in conditioner and the hair butter	15
1	i love love this product i ca n't believe how much i actually used it i ran out of my box within two months ! all those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder this kept my straps in place all day and night ! a few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom i use the strips to close the flap in place so it 's smooth all the way down tip in some cases i cut the strips in half even half a strip holds my bra straps in place this product holds things in place or down it does not lift and hold its not ducked tape	15
1	i have been using strivectin sd eye cream for one month i am 30 and have no wrinkles but some uneven skin tone so i cannot comment on wrinkle restoration my goal is prevention however i have a small unsightly broken blood vessel underneath one eye that i have had for 10 years applying strivectin 2x per day has diminished the appearance significantly in just 4 weeks i am of course hopeful that it will disappear completely with continued use i never expected that the broken blood vessel could be treated topically and i was thinking of having a laser treatment \( a bit scary though near the eye ! \) i am thrilled with the cream and will stick with it	15
0	i ca n't say enough about philosohpy but i read another review recomending not to get the mimosa scent because it smells like the tang drink so i purchased the margarita instead i hate to say it but it is probabloy about the same for this product it smells so much like kool aid that i ca n't use it the smell is way to sweet i am a big margarita fan but this smells nothing like it ! just a caution	15
0	a complete waste of money i still have all my stretch mark	15
1	i absolutely adore this scent ! it certainly is not just for men ! anyone who loves the smell of limes will love this ! the sea salt is amazing ! i literally have n't been able to use any other soap since discovering it two years ago and i used to be a body wash person ! never again ! give it a try ! it 'll wake you right up in the morning and keep your energy high	15
1	inis has a very fresh crisp clean scent that i love it 's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering which is what i like about it it 's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it whenever i wear it people always sniff and make comments like what are you wearing \? and mmm ! you smell so good	15
1	i absolutely love this fragrance i like and use a lot of philosophy products the only problem i have is that it does n't last long when i do put it on i get a lot of compliments when it 's fresh	15
1	i just got this item \( from ebay it 's cheaper \) and feel it 's worthy of praise i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair i have n't figured out how it curls but to wave it 's incredibly easy ! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w o burning your hair like a curling iron would also w a curling iron it 's difficult to wave the top close to the roots it heats fast ! and comes w a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools	15
0	this mascara works great it lengthens separates and defines your lashes and it does n't smudge but it 's so hard to take off ! i used lancome 's bi facil makeup remover which is designed to remove waterproof mascara but it was still hard to remove i lost quite a few lashes in the process i would recommend buying the regular definicils not the waterproof	15
0	after the debacle that was dirt i tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty is this a joke i am sure that jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here i am trying to wash this out of my hair with his very shampoo and all i have is tears clearly this is not product without tears	15
0	i have dyed red hair a lot of dyed red hair this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair will not purchase again	15
1	this is a perfect winter cream for me and would probably work for anyone else who has very dry skin \( e g you rub eucerin on at night \) it is very similar to the regular cream in appearance \( pink \) and smell \( not offensive \) but it is much heavier i started using this during the winter when i discovered the regular cream was n't heavy enough and it works just as well it spreads on pretty easily for such a thick cream and when i wake up my skin is dewy and moisturized	15
1	i am in love with this product it smells wonderful once you put it on and it really seems to relax sore muscles the only problem i have with it is i go through it too fast \( i probably use more than i need to \)	15
0	i had high hopes for this stuff i have watched blow out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair but i cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves i have tried it on wet hair damp hair dry hair no discernable difference i will stick to my frederic fekkai products they actually work	15
0	i received my order and was very dissapointed the skin tones online are deceiving i ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy does n't blend well with skin suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone	15
0	i have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer i used just a little bit and it was really greasy i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum it works much better	15
0	this product totally frizzed out my hair i had been having good luck for once with paul mitchell 's foaming mousse this jonathan product sadly rather than taming my hair induced the frizz a lot perhaps a stronger formula is needed or maybe i just do n't have fine limp enough hair i was very sad	15
0	my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned i thought it was too drippy i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand i would not recommend this conditioner	15
0	ick i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that i used to love by loreal smell fake grade school grape aid smell grossed me out feel i like lip gloss that feels glossy this stuff did not shine enough or last long enough color the color was to mild for me i was very disappointed i felt like i had wasted money and time i still recommend loreal lip juice though i believe it 's the same company and lip juice is glossy shiny long lasting and way more cost effective	15
1	this is my favorite scent from philosophy it is clean and crisp never over done	15
0	i normally like warm sensual type perfumes but i wanted to try something different for a change i liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey well i have to disagree i think it is very perfumey and not subtle at all to me it has a very sharp high toned scent which is almost acrid i thought at first that maybe i had sprayed too much on so i tried just a little spritz still very strong and sharp and i agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets i will definitely not be ordering this again	15
1	i love this fragrance ! it reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of hawaii if you 've ever visited the islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes and thought to yourself what is that heavenly smell \? this is it ! there is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as kai my only concern about this fragrance line is the cost but how i feel and think when i am wearing it makes it all worth it	15
1	is there anyone that does n't know sarah jessica parker \? great perfume very nice smell	15
0	try bill 's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding bill 's sliver gripper tweezers they are simply the best easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned and amazon has them	15
0	i used this product for a couple of months with no visible result in addition it 's quite greasy and since it 's not made to be used on the face we can understand that but that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses	15
0	the beads in this ice pack do not get cold at all it gets a little cold but warms up in about 45 seconds i also noticed very little over all effects from using it	15
1	this product really does feel like silk out of all the eye products i really like this one i would recommend it !	15
0	i should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like lemon pledge it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all i'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room	15
1	this stuff smells awesome i have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy i have n't used it yet because i love the smell so much and i do n't want it to go away i just ordered a bunch though so i will try it out they are really pretty too if i was a kid and did n't know any better i would probably try to eat it	15
0	i had trouble rinsing this stuff out it weighed my hair down and my hair is dry also my son came up to me and said why does your hair smell so funny \? i think it 's too conditioning for my hair and too smelly	15
0	if you buy this shampoo buy something else with it to get this glue out of your hair i guarantee you will be disappointed it is the equivalent of herbal essence \( also leaves your hair like glue	15
0	i really wanted to like this one but just could n't get past the smell it was really over powering lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this is n't one of them i did n't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely it was just too strongly scented for my liking	15
1	i was very pleased with this purchase the perfume arrived packaged nicely and was actually bigger than i expected 1 oz to be i love the scent and will definately buy more when this one is gone ! great experience with amazon	15
1	i normally do not like anything with a sandalwood scent but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull ! they are not lying when they refer to it as an addictive scent in the description i got a small sample bottle and fell in love it is perfect for the winter fall seasons not so much for the summer it 's fun when people ask what i'm wearing and i get to casually say prada considering i live in tennessee most people have no idea what that means but i still feel special	15
1	i 've gotten a few compliments on it by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent moreso than the big bottles i bought the 50 one and i do like it but i think it 's gonna take me awhile to finish it so from now on i 'll buy the 1 7 oz first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent but overall very fresh and sweet smelling	15
0	i ordered the fedora i am so dissapointed it came off within a few hours ! just peeled right off do not order this brand of fingernail polish it is the worst i have ever used	15
1	for some reason chicks dig this aroma i 've tried many clognes over many years but this gets the best reaction i'm getting more now at the request of several ladies so i decided to write this review with my luck they 'll stop making the stuff now so i'm buying 5 bottles just in case	15
1	i have coarse afrcian american hair that is relaxed straight this conditioner is the best i have ever used i wish i could buy it in a larger bottle the only thing however i think it is expensive because of the price i use it only when wanting to deeply condition my hair otherwise i would use it after every shampoo wonderful stuff	15
1	i really like this product i would not however agree with the person who said that it is entirely too strong a scent i would actually like it to be stronger and have less peel and more juice smell but it is a nice scent and cleans very thoroughly not the best i 've used but very nice	15
1	i have used hundreds of kinds of smoothers and conditioners on my thick color treated hair \( it is poofy and rough without any help ! \) and this stuff did the trick to make is smooth lay down and be soft in one treatment ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! buy this stuff if your hair is coarse and poofy and spilt damaged ! you need this stuff it smells good is easy to use \( and just use a tiny bit ! \) and works	15
1	this is such a nice lightweight conditioner and makes my hair smell super clean and fresh	15
1	i purchased this product based on the reviews and i ca n't begin to tell you how glad i am to have the hair honey it is wonderful ! ! it leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy the smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater i will be using this for a long time to come	15
0	it is true that this product smells absolutely awful after it is applied to the face worse it does absolutely nothing i have been applying a significant amount morning and night for 6 weeks allowing it to soak in and dry it does nothing	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
0	i'm black and for my hair type 4b i try to use natural products on my hair and it did n't have those no no chemicals and oils that are known to be damaging to black hair well this product did not as it advertised which was to stay put i tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb coils or finger coil in place i did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good sad thing is that i ca n't get my money back i use it as a hair grease for my scalp i hope i 've been helpful	15
1	my hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and i 've used it ever since it makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good just a little of biosilk goes a long way gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair i definitely reccomend it	15
1	sephora roll up blotting paper is so handy whenever you have to freshen up this is great to use before you powder your face all you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face they feel weightless and matte skin just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff gosh disgusting ! best of all you get so much paper the roll is never ending ! it 's so tiny and compact you would even want to share them with your friends	15
0	i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k y jelly frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	its effect very much depends on the climate you live in if you live in a colder and dry climate especially during winter it does exactly as it promises great moisturizer lines are diminished as is puffiness i really love using it i am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate but in hot and sometims humid climates or during summer it just does n't work as well i do n't know why i like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle although i am using it as a seasonal eye care	15
1	unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions you should n't use this i have oily normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me it is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients but beware this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing it is not in my opinion as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin and does not contain the retinyl palmitate both are good but kinerase cream is better	15
1	bubbles nicely but does not smell like hot milk i 've never tried milky bar so i have no idea if the two compare hot milk \? is comforting though its like being wrapped in warm fluffy towels straight from the dryer	15
0	i received this as a gift i was thrilled with the results the first few times i used it then the little red light went out while i was straightening my hair and it has never worked since i only got to use it three times	15
1	wonderfully light and clean scent ! both men and women have asked me what i was wearing hours after i thought the scent was gone it does not overpower when layering lotion and spray it 's a beautiful fragrance i love it	15
0	i hate to say this since philosophy is one of my favorite brands but this is probably the worst mascara i have ever used it clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove it does not simply wash off it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink about half of them remain attached to your lashes and i 've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara everything else i 've ever tried from philosophy was fantastic but the best mascara out there hands down is from lancome	15
0	i loved the smell in the magazines so i decided to get it well it was good at first and then i got tired it smells a little cheap and sort of like pine i sometiems use it but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits \( that 's what i use it for \) i think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long	15
1	i have been looking for this eyeliner for years ! ever since they stopped carrying it at rite aid i have been on a quest to find the perfect waterproof eyeliner to replace the 2 99 lord and berry one i even tried expensive brands like mac and clinique with no such luck this eyeliner is great for women who like to line their inner eye it goes on smooth and dark and stays put until you wash it off	15
1	this stuff smell delicious who can resist \? i love it ! ! smells like chocolate mint to me love i	15
0	i would n't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself after using this so called instant detangler my hair was more tangled then ever in my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job	15
0	i love these products however this particular candle does not have the same intense scent as previous candles i 've purchase	15
1	whenever i saw glass or porcelain nail files in stores i always thought they were overpriced you can get all kinds of nail files for a couple of bucks and i did n't see a reason to pay more but i was given one of these and now i think it 's worth it it is a really strong file so strong that my mother was startled by how much it took off the first time she used it you really only need very gentle pressure and speed with this type of file it is very easy too clean and shows no signs of wear by this time i usually would have killed a normal file	15
1	expensive but a small amount makes a big difference excellent conditioner for dry thick hair also very pleasing fragrance the best hair treatment i 've found for my straight coarse dry hair highly recommended	15
1	this is a very rich creme i find it works best for me if i use it all over my face once or twice a week my face breaks out if i use it more often i am 63 years old so blemishes are not a common occurrence for me another alternative would be to use it only on the brow and under the eyes but in that case i would recommend the strivectin sd eye creme which does not have the mint fragrance	15
0	after the debacle that was dirt i tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty is this a joke i am sure that jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here i am trying to wash this out of my hair with his very shampoo and all i have is tears clearly this is not product without tears	15
1	i 've been using city lips for the past 6 months and i absolutely love it ! i especially love the moisturizing effect i used to have to use chapstick constantly but now i never use it my lips now are always soft and moisturized and fuller !	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	really enjoy using this as body wash the smell is divine but the bubbles do n't last long if used as a bubble bath or shampoo moisturizing to my dry skin	15
1	i absolutely love this kit i love that i can use the great mystery every morning and it is n't harsh on my skin and i love using the greatest love at night and when i wash it off it just melts into my skin i do n't even have to put on a moisturizer for something really nice try using the great mystery and then put the greatest love on top of that it 's really amazing the only caution i would have is when using the greatest love do n't rub it in you have to massage it very lightly otherwise it will irritate your skin and can cause breakouts or make you feel like you have a sun burn	15
1	this cologne smells great a guy i know wears it and whenever he hugs me i smell this and well he smells fantastic in fact the way he smelled was one of the first things that interested me in him i'm a big fan of the original curve cologne which smells really nice as well boys men ca n't go wrong wearing either of them	15
0	maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products however this shampoo did not work for me like the previous reviewer said it was watery and did not lather at all it also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard i followed up with a hair smoothie but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair i do not recommend this at all	15
1	yum ! fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever i use this it smells wonderful deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge this shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin i do n't like it as a shampoo as much when i do use it to wash my hair i'm sure to follow up with a conditioner it 's a delightful product and i'm pleased with my purchase	15
0	on a scale of 1 to 5 the packaging gets a negative 1 you ca n't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle ended up removing top for value of product jonathan gets a 1 for quality of product 3 the conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter need to use more than average the conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair but no better than other quality brands i do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time but bed head has a similar product that 's been out for a while for that option i would rather choose bed head for quality and price	15
1	if you are like me and get the occasional zit when you least expect it then this works out well it will not remove the zit but it will cover the nasty monster pretty well ! ! i put it under my lancome powder and it really made a difference because it is clear it will blend in with whatever foundation or powder you use oh yes and it covers all the redness that comes with those nasty zits a girls new best friend	15
0	i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store first of all do not expect to see any plumping what so ever it makes no difference in how your lips look secondly it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball the only reason this gloss is 18 is because of the too faced name brand dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good better for a few bucks at the drugstor	15
0	this item did not even work and for the price you pay i feel it was a rip off	15
1	this is awesome for thick curly hair apply when wet and it absorbs and keeps you moisturized for days also good with shea butter to 'slick smooth' edges for a ponytail	15
0	i'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product i opened this bottle expecting a totally yummy scent but what i got was nothing like what i expected ! when i read that it smelled the nesquick i thought i 'd like it anyway because i love strawberry nesquick but this stuff smells like well i ca n't describe it all i know is i wish i had n't paid 16 for it live and learn i guessperhaps the strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel smells better off topic why do they have a strawberry milk shake 3 in 1 gel and a strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel \? would n't they smell just the same	15
1	what i like most about these vitamins is that they are very small and easy to swallow unlike a lot of other hair and nail vitamins which are huge i am not sure if i notice a difference in the condition of my hair but i will continue to purchase and use the vitamins nevertheless	15
1	this fragrance smells great if you have used the awesome fresh lemon sugar shower gel it smells exactly the same it smells much better than the other sugar fragrance that has been around a long time this one is clean and fresh and uplifting	15
1	this stuff goes on easy stays well \( but will rub off with water wo n't withstand a good cry \) nice not quite as nice as the victoria 's secret liner \( i swear by that stuff discontinued 3 4 years ago \) but way better than anything cheaper i have tried other things plus wo n't irritate my very sensitive eyes	15
1	i order the ash color for blondes and found that it is just the right color i also purchased the anastasia brow stensils with this item and finally seem to have found a solution for my thin mismatched brow problem i have ordered many bare escentuals products and love all of them	15
1	i purchased this one month ago and i will never use anything else blends wonderfully great colors i bought it for my daughter from amazon sephora as well great product	15
1	i absolutely love this fragrance when i put this on i get a warm musky scent that lasts for hours i put the spray cologne version of falling in love on top to brighten it up a bit when i feel like it it is subtle but i think it is a very sexy and warm scent and not at all overpowering definitely something my husband wants to be near	15
1	cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance that certainly is chanel no 22 it 's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of chanel no 5 coco chanel and ernest beaux developed yet another fragrance naming it no 22 for the year it was presented it may have been created in 1922 but it 's as up to the minute as tomorrow especially in the new spray	15
0	i have this gloss in carney while i like the color the gloss is very gooey and gloppy and it does n't stay on long at all i would not buy it again	15
1	i absolutely love this chanel foundation it is lightweight and yet provides fair to good coverage i like this foundation because it does not feel heavy and it is water based it can be worn in the daytime or evening use with chanel loose powder and chanel concealer for a perfectly flawless finish	15
1	i am very impressed with the whole bobbi brown line this lip gloss is no exception these lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end the colors are fantastic these glosses are all very neutral and natural looking colors none of these glosses are going to make you look too made up just make you look finished the texture is not too tacky or sticky and it has a light scent not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss i highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them	15
0	what 's the point of this mascara when half the container does n't do what it 's supposed to do \? the black mascara is not good quality it comes off very quickly part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara and the silver stuff the only reason someone would seek out this product is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand	15
1	i try a lot of products and this is simply my favorite not only do they feel luxurious they look amazing in my bathroom i sent my mom a set and she loves it too	15
0	i am asian and i have very thick and coarse hair i bought this product due to all the rave but it did nothing for me and it does n't even smell nice after trying numerous products and flat irons i had thermal reconditioning done my hair has never been smoother silkier and so easily manageable no product or styling necessary just wash and go	15
1	i bought this but the perfume side was a clear color not purple colored and there is no color in the lip gloss it 's ust glittery but i love i	15
0	this shampoo made my hair flat and dry when i used it every day so i tried using another shampoo and used jonathan 's once a week the one day i used jonathan shampoo my hair was noticably flat and dull i ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo what a disappointment	15
0	i enjoyed using this product because i liked the tingling from the mint not necessarily a good thing actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face the kaolin and bentonite are drying agents peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin if you separate out the so called natural ingredients you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses and if it does n't come straight out of the ground it ai n't natural anymore ! i give it a 2 because i was a sucker for the tingling not because i saw any improvement in my skin 's texture look or feel	15
1	i love zoya polish it is pure and the colors are fabulous they stay and stay and stay i'm ready to order again	15
1	i just started using carols daughters products but i really like the hair honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front i just use a little water and hair honey tie a scarf for about ten minutes and my all natural new growth is smooth soft and exactly where i want it to be without using harsh gels sprays or spritzes i am using this and the cd healthy hair butter as a leave in i love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair	15
1	wear make up every day and i usually wear foundation eyeliner mascara eyeshadow and lip gloss that 's my every day make up by the end of the day i have to get it off in order to sleep well lancome make up remover helps me a lot its very easy to use it takes off make up quickly and without scrubbing it 's gentle and not irritating it also smells nice though it 's kind of expensive it 's a good product	15
0	after i ordered this product one of my co workers told me about the reviews on amazon i checked it out and i was really surprised ! the reviews are poor the worst part though is that the product is listed three times ! ! what 's the deal \? \? a product gets a bad review so they re list it more bad reviews and they re list it again ! see for yourself do a general search for hylexin and you will see several listings of the same product trying to out run bad reviews \? \? \? \? i now think less of the product and amazon shame on you both	15
0	it stings burns and irritated my skin didnt prevent any breakouts i bought the whole complex set and this is the one that hurts the most 0 stars if i could need i say more	15
1	my husband and i sat next to a woman on our flight to prague who smelled absolutely delicious a asked her what fragrance she was wearing and she replied marc jacobs i remember it was fresh and clean and subtly floral without being overly sweet now 6 months later i came across it in lord taylor sprayed a tester on my wrist and instantly remembered why the fragrance was so captivating without more than 30 seconds of contemplation i purchased the gift set ca n't wait to experience this fresh winning scent over and over again	15
1	when you buy this perfume for your girlfriend do n't tell her it was under 40 dollars ! i do n't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume yeah like it really smells better just because it 's more expensive anyway sarah jessica parker perfume has a really nice scent that you 'll want to smell over and over it 's nice that you do n't have to spend a lot of money on it either add just a touch for proper use	15
0	i ordered this product because it was recommended to me on another skincare website however i have n't wanted to use this product much due to it 's odor very medicinal chemical smelling makes me wonder what sort of harsh chemicals are going on my face ! i used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and did n't notice any difference in my skin i would n't recommend this product unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
1	i got a sample of this conditioner when i bought a similar product by another company i did n't care for the one i purchased but the sample was awesome and i am going to buy the jonathan conditioner i have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products i used this for a week and this is the only thing i have ever seen any kind of difference with i love it !	15
1	the best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent apply and leave on the skin for about 20 30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly then you start shaving it 's great because you do n't feel the razor on the skin as much which makes shaving quite pleasant i 've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is anthony logistics which i do n't think as nice as philosophy common man a little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long i would buy this again	15
1	i received a sample of this mascara \( in black \) and just love it it 's perfect for everyday wear as it 's not too dramatic and is very long lasting in fact it 's so long lasting that i even took a nap while wearing it and it did n't smudge at all i was pleased to find however that it came off very easily with my clinque rinse off foaming cleanser so there was no need for a separate eye make up remover i have more expensive mascaras than this and they are not as good definitely a great product	15
1	i recently discovered benefit products this is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin i use it to highlight my cheek bones you can use it any where you want a glance to linger the best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin i suggest you try this product it works wonders	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
1	i used veganese for quite awhile quite happily as there is no artificial fragrance or strong natural fragrance oils in the product it has a ho hum scent this actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market i felt veganese adequately conditioned my hair did not irritate my scalp i liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product	15
1	this fragrance starts off fine but the longer you wear the better it gets and that very nice smell lasts a wonderfully long time ! !	15
1	bought this for my boyfriend and i ca n't stop smelling him because it 's unlike any other cologne i 've ever come upon it 's so intriguing that i find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it i can best describe it as a soft suede with hints of amber vanilla and wood it smells better after it 's been on the skin for a while it does have a slight feminine scent however this makes me like it more and makes me want him to wear it more it 's definetely for a confident man	15
1	this is a great idea for a product ! for those of you who do n't wash your hair every day this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you do n't wash it i used this after 5 days without washing and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful ! well done	15
1	i love this product ! i look forward to the end of the day knowing that i can soothe my tired feet with fair trade foot lotion ! i 've seen this product work wonders prior to this purchase when my husband was in the army his feet were extremley worn and torn when he came home from iraq after using this product for several days his feet looked and felt brand new	15
1	i use this everyother day before shampooing my hair is much less greasy after using it ! ! i 've also noticed that my hair seems to have more body at the roots it also has a very pleasant orange citrus scent this product is worth every cent i definitely recommend it for those with oily scalps and thinning hair	15
1	i have tried i think every product on the market nothing was helping my acne it just kept getting worse i still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this i loved it it did dry my skin out a little but whatever works ! my skin is clearer and smoother it just is n't perfect but who is	15
0	this foam product by jonathan is okay the reviews on his products are highly overrated the price does n't bother me at all there are better foams for thin and limp hair	15
0	i have an ancient lancome facial brush that i was attempting to replace i bought this brush tried it and went back to my old one in my opinion this brush is far too soft and does n't feel like it is cleaning at all a wash cloth would be better	15
0	sorry to say i found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying something i have n't experienced with other removers in addition it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish on the plus side it 's fragrance free and reasonable in price	15
1	tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers i 've ever purchased they stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise quick and virtually painless and when they do go dull all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so they arrive back good as new you ca n't beat that !	15
1	i love auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume pink sugar to death but it is such an overpowering scent that i am often smelled before i am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate aquolinas new perfume chocolovers is similarly sweet but much subtler if you love the sweet scent of pink sugar but do n't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away try chocolovers	15
1	this is a great mascara it does n't get clumpy but it leaves your lashes fuller longer and it lasts without flaking or smudging well worth the price which is surprisingly lower than most other department store brands	15
0	if philosophy makes it for my skin i think i own it i love the microdelivery peel kit which came with 30 of these pads when i bought the set the micro peel is awesome but these pads were disappointing they dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit i have seen no difference since i discontinued using this product seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths	15
1	i have been using this product for over a year only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes a little goes a long long way one jar lasted me about 4 months using every day this product blends into the skin quickly and i use it under make up it calms my skin i am happy about this product	15
1	this is my absolute favorite product by lush i received a huge box of bath ballistics for my birthday and out of the whole thing this was the best ! it made the water a nice purple color \( without a ring around the tub \) and made my skin smell great even the next day ! i would recommend this one to any first timers so you can see what the buzz around lush is all about ! i am stocking up on this one	15
0	i have eczema so my scalp is very dry and sensitive this relaxer burned my hair so severely i though it would fall out i developed huge scores with thick scabs after having this relaxer professionally applied to my hair	15
1	i first tried amazing grace a couple of years ago at that time i had a dresser full of department store colognes the scent of amazing grace is somehow undescribable suffice it to say it is the perfect fragrance and those other scents are history it is pleasing to the person who wears it and is pleasing to someone just walking by you some perfumes walk into a room before the person does or is so strong it makes other people 's eyes water we 've all been around someone like that not so with amazing grace it is just in harmony with you and those around you	15
1	fahrenheit by dior has a fragrance like no other i 've been fascinated by this fragrance ever since i can remember it is bold and fragrant generally people seem to either like it a lot or hate it it seems a little overpowering at first but as i said you either like it or hate it the fragrance is masculine no doubt and it 's not something that i 'd use in summer essentially a night fragrance	15
0	happy has a really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins it is like cheap colognes	15
1	i really enjoyed that this powder let your face looking clean and matte finished instead for shine with glitter like some other bronzers do	15
0	i have tried the lush products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the melt product line any benefits i thought i was getting from lush out the window their products seemed all the sudden unimpressive and i really like that melt is denver based ! try them out and see what you think for yourself \( if you are n't here in colorado i know they have online products too \) and make your own choice i recomend them though and i have told everyone i know to switch !	15
1	love the bare escentuals line of products not one for makeups to begin with this allows me to even out my skin tone give vibrance and is good for the skin have never had any skin problems with this line and believe me my skin is sensitive	15
1	i am a hair fanatic test and try everything this comb is the best comb i 've come across for my hair i have a lot of thick hair so this comb really does the job i have been using avon combs for over 5 years now and love them very strong and do n't break easily because my hair is thick i still need to use conditioner to help detangle it other wise my hair would be ruined worth every penny and for 4 99 you ca n't lose	15
0	until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave ins it made my dry curly hair soft shiny and smelling great ! but lately something has changed the once thick silky liquid has turned thin and watery with a distinctly alcohol like smell it 's so disappointing this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book do n't bother with it anymore unless the original formula comes back	15
0	i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses there must be a quality control problem my bottle had no noticible pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair i was only trying to go 1 day without washing what a disappointing product and a waste of my money	15
0	unless you have a new softball glove to break in this product is not for you way way too much oil just nappy i might as well have put mayo in my hair	15
1	these are good and do the trick but it 's hard to get my fingers in the holes	15
1	i have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked initially i was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised it certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes it may seem expensive but a little goes a very very long way has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating and i have sensitive skin try it i do n't think you 'll be disappointed i was n't	15
0	i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about i was not impressed it smells just like ordinary soap so what \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well you can get soap that smells better at wal mart !	15
1	this nail polish is by far the best nail product i have ever purchased ! i stumbled accross it in france two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since the brush is great depositing the polish smoothly and thinly the product dries quickly and lasts a long time it is amazing	15
1	mac lipglass is the absolute best there are plenty of colors to choose from super shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and does n't run the best colors are nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes it 's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer just pure shine	15
0	this stuff is very expensive and i 've diligently used it as the directions state i havent seen growth i am actually losing more eyelashes ! ! i was going to buy the mascara if i grew the eyelashes but it does n't seem to be working sigh	15
1	i like this lotion it is moisturizing retexturing but sort of waxy hence the 4 stars but it is still good stuf	15
1	i typically do n't wear much cologne or perfume but this one is a winner ! my husband bought this one for me for christmas i 'd never even seen it before but he liked how it smelled what a great guy ! i could n't have been happier with this gift i love this scent clean and fresh you can wear this scent day or night not heavy or overwhelming the unique beauty of the bottle is wonderful too highly recommend beyond paradise	15
0	i really wanted this to work i have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else but i 've been using this twice a day for two months and i have n't noticed any improvement at all not even a little in fact my eyes might actually look worse it has not faded the dark circles nor has it improved the bags	15
0	disappointingly this tape did not perform as well as hoped it was unable to hold medium or heavier weight fabrics in place using a one inch piece under bra straps did not keep them from slipping the tape and straps eventually started rolling and it definitely was unable to help prevent a strapless bra from succumbing to newton 's law of gravity ! so not only did fashion faux pas continue to occur the tape caused a rash skin irritation with each use	15
1	i received a free sample during clinique days at my local department store i wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how clean and light it smelled two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves it is perfect for a light clean scent during the day to wear to work or a day out with friends or that special someone it smells wonderful but not as though you are trying too hard perfect	15
1	although i find this soap a bit sweet \( almost bubble gum sweet \) my daughter \( teen \) loves it all little girls would love this especially with the glitter stars and random colors we get it often the bathroom smells nice after a shower too	15
0	i first bought inis cologne in ireland in 2001 and have not used anything else since that time i will go to great lengths to find the cologne i am very glad it is now being offered by amazon	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
0	i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips it just wont glide you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em clinique liners are the worst one in the market	15
1	what a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow paula dorf says where are the brights \? not here and calls the shadows softly muted that is true but do n't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow it 's also named glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it the selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone i bought the gold which is subtle but is still gold i love the way it goes on and it 's suitable for day or night paula dorf will never have you looking like a clown but i do n't find these shades boring either	15
0	i knew i was taking a chance buying a cheap eye cream and sure enough i was right it did nothing ! well yo get what you pay for ! i was going to try the ocuderm or ddf products and i guess i will do that now costs more but the results i hear are great i should of known better	15
1	i love the scent of the grapefruit bergamot bubble bath this combination is suitable for men or women deep steep products are really first rate the foot scrub and lotions are well worth the money	15
1	i love the smell of philosophy pure grace the shampoo shower gel smells just as clean and fresh as the perfume it 's not too drying either	15
1	proraso shave cream is the best bang for the buck in hi end non drugstore shave creams i 've tried them all and keep coming back to proraso the texture consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate and you do n't need a badger hair brush ! i initially missed using a brush at first but do n't miss all the product i wasted that were left behind in the bristles couple proraso with a good safety razor \( may i suggest merkur \) and you 'll get a shave that trounces anything a mach iii can throw at you trust me	15
1	i was hooked on sebastian 's shine serum forever then i switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews it makes it just as shiny as the sebastian but for my thick wavy hair it is easier to apply i only need about a quarter size amount way less than any other product it has a nice soft finish so if you like sebastian and redkin 's shine serums you 'll like this i'm not going to go as far as to say it 's a miracle worker it makes your hair shinier it helps a little with my frizz but does n't depouf	15
1	i am satisfied wih both the product and the delivery time i would order it again	15
1	it 's the best product i 've used to create volume and hold i did n't notice it after blow drying but while using the curling iron and styling my hair had a lot more volume and great hold i have straight fine limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style i truely noticed a big difference i plan to purchase the other volumizing products once they are in stock	15
1	forget all those other so called good colognes out there happy for men is the best smelling one of them all ! it may be expensive but it is well worth it example i sprayed down a shirt with it and send it home with my girlfriend at her request ! she requested this because she wanted have something of mine that she could sleep with it while we are apart that is how good it is ! enjoy	15
1	i bought this last month in purple looks awesome and it does n't hurt when you put it on best of all it stays on and if you set it it will stay all day	15
0	the alpha version of postal inspector is of very poor video quality otherwise it may have been an interesting mishmash in what was bela 's last film under his original universal contract the stock footage of the flood is spectacular	16
1	if your a fan of progressive rock you probably already know how good this cd is in my mind it is the single greatest cd of all time \( followed closely by operation mindcrime any of the great pink floyd and rush records \) my only complaint on this dvd is the sound i was at this show and the sound at the theater was great somewhere it did n't transfer to the recording it is not the worst thing i have ever heard but it does n't show the bands power live every other aspect of this dvd is well worth the price i would not want to be with out it	16
1	i thought the video was well done it was good to feature the clinchinggames of the division and league championship series plus all four gamesof the world sries i think they should have included at least the high lights on a extra disk of games 1 and 2 of the division series againstboston and games 1 2 3 and 4 of the league championship series againstlos angeles still i highly recommend this collection for all gung howhite sox fans who cherish the memory of the most exciting season in 88years a great viewing companion for those cold winter nights	16
1	i love the simpsons ! although the early seasons are classic they seem to get better and more funny as they go on this season includes the episode where milhouse 's parents get divorced which is hilarious and the one where homer eats those hot chili peppers and freaks out ! definitely worth the purchase there are a lot of extras too	16
1	while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times the genius of david bowie shines through as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust it was an amazing look at the time period the sound quality is suprisingly good although some camera angles are distracting at times it was also neat to hear bowie 's pronouncement of this is our last tour ever little did he know this dvd is worth every penny rock on	16
1	if you have read the conversations with god books then you will enjoy this movie about the incredible journey that brought neale donald walsh to where he is today very inspiring	16
1	this little girl lives by herself its wild how she lives and what out for that white powder ! mario is her only friend and trap door is a goner	16
1	for being such a perky story with some steamy scenes this film rescues the genre of erotic comedy films	16
1	dave is a lot of fun as a look alike gets to pretend to be president gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power and makes high stakes enemies i am a big fan of sigourney weaver and she is very good here kevin kline does well as well the forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love definitely worth a rental if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag	16
0	i gave one star beacuse it is not color this very old movies i want some in color about depression i have the prombleof the derpression of you have any movies about this please let me kno	16
1	my husband received this dvd for his birthday my husband grew up with the pittsburg steelers and still today is a true fan as a family we all sat and watched this wonderful dvd on the steelers and all of us enjoyed it very much it goes back to the begining of time for the steelers it shows the superbowls and how the steel curtin got it 's name if you love the steelers then this 2 dvd set is a must have you will not be disappointed	16
1	this exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space this is great for people who do not have alot of room after exercising to the video i felt really good energized i would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising it is low impact and easy to follow	16
1	this video is awsome if you dont like this video then you can't be t true pantera fan it doesnt get any better than this except for live watch it go ! ! !	16
0	nothing original here nothing overly humourous overall pretty bland in my opinion the only part i thought was really worth watching was when the casket exploded at the end	16
1	this jet li movie is thus far the best movie since shaolin temple as younger jet li its awesome surreal fighting creates this epic feel to the whole genre of martial arts fighting jet li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie it has laughter suspense compassion and innocense the most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the witches pawn this film is highly recommended to those who love jet li and crouching tiger hidden dragon an excellent movie to add to the jet li collection	16
1	i have laughed and shared this with everyone i know and they are still laughing with me soooo many hidden meanings though if you ca n't laugh with this you ca n't laugh r kinard houston t	16
0	this animated perversion of star wars is an insult to one of the best sci fi epics of all times the characters are utterly rediculus \( seriously if the jedi were that actually powerful why did they need the clones \? \) there is no plotline to speak of and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting if you want a good build up to episode iii i suggest playing star wars republic commando and reading labyrinth of evil and the other clone wars novels do n't wast your money on this it 's not worth it	16
0	ooo ! see halle act act halle act emote emote see halle act drunk see halle act crying see halle act nympho act halle act can someone explain to me how the senior prison guard on death row and a woman whos been visiting her husband there for 11 years never managed to see one another before he ordered chocolate ice cream with a plastic spoon \? but what does it matter since we get to see halle act \? act halle act !	16
0	most boring of the barbie movies i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever and i agree with another reviewer princess and the pauper and rapunzel much better ! ! !	16
0	so i finally rented this tripe as i was curious gee making fun of former soviet block nations people and rednecks now there 's some seriously funny stuff not ! what 's next \? a cutting edge comedy on the rap culture \? oops he already did this with the ali g show gross out potty humour now that 's inventive and we 've never seen that before ! i also like the lame o attempt to show how americans are all anti semitic by putting words into the mouths of those trying to sell him something these are your imagined demons foes sacha and overall your film is pretty boring and about as fresh as a yakov smirnoff comedy bit	16
1	i heard so much about masaki kobayashi 's harakiri so i bought it at amazon and watched it wow this movie is awesome ! ! now i do n't know who is my 1 favorite director akira kurosawa or masaki kobayashi this black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by tohru takemitsu in addition to these assets the camera is wonderful i pick this movie as one of my movies of my life tatuyua nakadai was shining in this movie i like him more after seeing harakiri	16
0	the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \)	16
1	this film is one big joke you have all the basics elements of romance \( love at first sight great passion etc \) and gangster flicks \( brutality dagerous machinations the mysterious don etc \) but it is all done with the crudest humor it 's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately get or you do n't that is a matter of taste and expectations i enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s when nicolson and turner were in their primes the acting is very good if a bit obviously tongue in cheek recommended	16
1	the series just keeps on getting better the bob newhart show was one of the best comedies ever on television the other funny show was newhart which i cannot understand why it has not been released on dvd the whole cast just clicks i wish shows like this were still on television if you enjoy a good laugh then buy this and the other sets !	16
0	i purchased dick cavett 's john lennon and yoko ono interview and it was great it was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material i gained new insight about john and yoko so i bought cavett 's interview of jimi hendrix expecting something similar the 15 minutes of glib questions by cavett produced nothing new about hendrix included in the dvd are a few minutes of jimi playing at woodstock the rest of the dvd is mediocre at best	16
0	i'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst \( or that level of indefatigable cuteness \) just go rent dick instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country	16
0	i take this title form the video store thinking in wynton marsalis when i was watching the dvd i can appreciate that the image is very good \( not great and i have a 720p tube tv \) and the sound is very good also \( not great i have a reference equipment \) but the show is so boring look you just desire this man stop to blow the drum 's solo is just awesome but the rest of the show is to forgive about it	16
1	excellent comedy good choice if you need a good laugh rodney dangerfield and bill murray at thier bes	16
1	leather wing would only buy this if he ran out of toilet paper because you know a dvd makes good toilet paper \( maybe it 's why he 's so grumpy \) i would suggest purchasing it and watching it michael moore may be more to the left than some but god has n't anyone ever considered watching everything with a speculative eye \? it 's less biased than the news is he reports you decide and most of it is things that should have been covered by the news in some fashion but were n't michael moore is far more honest than the republican talking heads \( rush coulter hannity \) watch enjoy investigate further	16
1	all things aside the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end stated this way without ruining the ending played a great part as a supporting actor his name is justin goncalves i think this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had i was particularly impressed with the part he played	16
1	i love this film beautifully simple and human the characters are real flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them just like your own family i 've rented at least fifteen times and i never get bored of it it 's great any time of year but fantastic for the holidays	16
1	this movie is an action mystery space love story with a lot of interesting charecters and you really get into it there is little swearing and half a second of nudity which does n't show anything but somebodies backside i would recomend this movie the ending is a surprise and there is cool plot twists	16
1	a b w film classic excellent story and performances from all the stars perhaps the acting style is a little dated a very god qulaity transfer to dvd except for one scene that is a little grainy i will watch this film again and again	16
0	bad bad bad worst villan worst plot worst actors worst song nothing was good about it ! ! !	16
0	i was so excited when this dvd came out hoping to get the four pittsburgh steelers highlight films from the '70s 98 of all this material is already included in the super bowl collection sets put out last year on dvd why wo n't nfl films step up and give us more \? \? \? this should be a steeler specific box set not some rehash of the entire season for all teams come on steve sabol give us what we want ! !	16
0	the unbearable lightness of being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason the point of kundera 's writing is not his plot or even his characters but his style for instances his endless digressions about history politics and philosophy for the movie we are left with nothing but plot and character ok what is one to do \? that in itself would n't be so bad if i did n't watch the film with the constant thought i could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie this is a slow film it takes an hour and a half story and takes three hours to tell it i ca n't recommend the film	16
1	this one of those movies that i can watch over and over again the story is great acting is good and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best the force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity i would love to go on a tornado hunt the special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie i would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars the loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts rent it buy it watch it ! it is well worth your time and money	16
0	i was very disappointed with this second edition my daughter and i loved the first action filled movie and had hoped this would be just as exciting the movie dragged out for the first half and just got worse during the second half i continually kept looking at the clock wondering when it would be over we only watched it once and it will go in the rummage sale later this year	16
0	the recent disappearance of spalding gray has made me realize what i do n't like about this film its narcissism it 's gray 's defining characteristic after a while despite jonathan demme 's fabulous direction \( he makes the best of a limited repertoire \) it just gets boring	16
0	i love the office what i do n't love is amazon listing a 3 disc boxed set of seasons 1 and 2 and the 2 bbc specials for sale and then mailing me 2 separate discs of seasons 1 and 2 so be aware that amazon is not shipping what they advertise here i have contacted them and have had not a reply about this	16
1	my six year old \( who has never been very excited about exercise \) really loves this dvd the routine is active fun and most importantly easy to learn other videos have simply left her frustrated when the routine was complicated or very little instruction was offered she completed the workout the first day and when she woke up the next morning she asked to do it again ! my 2 1 2 year old has a great time dancing with us as well	16
1	filmed at new york 's improv in 1971 we see a young pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous more polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album quot craps after hours quot however witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother 's prostitution then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said this scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come	16
0	this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then	16
0	i should have left this review a long time ago i could kick myself for buying it thinking it was a film not a religous object if you critisize this film amongst religious radicals you risk being burned at the stake an act of love to purify your soul this film as a film disregarding the topic is a dog a cheap b grade blood spurting flesh flying horror flick in aramaic with sub titles i could go on for an hour but wo n't bother	16
1	this is a visually elegant and thematically frightening movie it conjures up some authentically unearthly and mysterious atmosphere once agan the outstanding musical accompaniment of tomandandy helps to elevate the film to a level of dread not seen since don't look now back in '73 this was a strangely malinged and neglected film at the time of its release but i think history will mark it out alongside white noise as the best of the thrillers that came out in the wake of the success of the sixth sense	16
0	quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time clive owen is really cool but not in this movie angelina jolie 's polital agenda totally fueled this film what a waste of time	16
0	she sings and acts like a airhead he acts like the sams sort of idiots who fight in the professional wrestkers league from the moment these two were married in 2002 the press and the talk shows were all over them like vultures flying over a carcass so the silly fools did this stupid reality show for mtv destroying whatever change they might have had in a life together and filmed every aspect of their lives in front of a camera now today big surprise simpson and lachly are getting divorsed the silly fools asked for it and in the end it led to heart break	16
1	i received this in a speedy manner and it was in great condition i would buy from this person again	16
0	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi	16
0	i saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies i have seen during the last two years stupid stupid and stupid ryan reynolds becomes annoying if you have brain never watch this movi	16
1	stoners music girls 80 's high school times in cali it takes you back to when vans were cool and the girls had way to much hairspray everytime i watch this movie im ready to hit the beach good movie	16
0	they suck ! bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established chapelle humor it was like watching mind of mencia two thumbs down leave this one alone tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though	16
0	i was watching cinemax one night bored out of my mind and unable to sleep when this movie came on the acting made me laugh the premise made me laugh everything about it made me laugh hey at least it was fun to make fun of anyway just kinda mad that i wasted a good 80 minutes on this piece of crap	16
0	i watched ten minutes of beanie seagal trying to act and turned my dvd player off to read a book i had to i felt like i was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie it looked so common i did n't even need to see the rest to tell you the end i'm willing to bet some people got shot somebody got away with the crime the police arrested beanie and somebody 's mother was yelling at somebody i do n't even care if i'm right or wrong because regardless i'm not gonna finish watching this movie	16
1	this movie was the first dvd i ever bought ! it is truly a gem i like the infinifilm bonus features \( it may not have been called infinifilm at this time \) brett ratner is truly a comedic genius and really gives the customer great quality dvd 's the movie is funny and interesting enough i enjoyed the scenes in several different locales i enjoyed the physical interactions between jackie and chris tucker i think the stunts were wonderfully orchestrated jackie chan is a genius at physical comedy i highly recommend this dvd two thumbs up ! ! ! mc white said check it out ! ! !	16
0	i bought basically because i love denisee richards and daryl hanna plus i like also valerie tasso besides i am a fan of pierre woodman they all appear on the film among some well know adult stars like dora venter rita faltoyano but really the film is not good at all it is slow the elements do n't match it is sometimes hard to follow it is really not worth buying it	16
1	i showed this movie to my students they had red the book and this was reenforcement fore the lesson they really enjoyed it	16
0	i loved these guys as a kid this collection sucks ! ! ! do n't buy it ! the first 3 dvd 's are silent and the 5th dvd is a reunion show the grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4 take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually if i could get my money back i would run to the nearest post office and return this item asap ! !	16
1	first i thought i bought it for my great old days but it 's not i really love it and i ca n't stand watch it and watch it again ! ! hi studio would you please release the 2nd season ! ! almost 2 years waiting \? o come o	16
1	this is a great show and very entertaining the story is n't the greek classic but it 's a fine riff on it the songs are good and they grow on you as you watch i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character it 's just a cartoon for pete 's sake like some other reviewers i was also annoyed with michael bolton singing go the distance over the end credits but this dvd has a music video of the spanish language version no importa la distancia sung by ricky martin and it is killer ! this one is well worth the money	16
1	this is a fine leveled workout including stretching aerobics abdominal exercises and strength training moves \( without weights \) gilad takes you through it with plenty of advance cues and tips to help you change moves smoothly and position yourself properly for optimum muscle and cardiac work the 30 minute workout is just right for an early morning before work routine the 60 minute version is an extended workout good for weekends much better than most of these videos this is particularly well suited to middle aged fitness buffs	16
1	jewish soles trying to avoid the devil 's brigade \( hitler 's killing machine \) sad but oh so funny and cute in sections that alas maybe only the jewish people would truly understand i found it all of these things but with love warmth to the end	16
1	while the dubbing may be a little annoying i still love this movie the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book do n't expect the deepest movie in the world but do expect a quality martial arts film	16
0	i really did give this a chance but i ca n't say i like the show it focuses more on the police aspect and less on the science which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there i know david caruso has his fans but i just ca n't appreciate him in this vehicle	16
0	my god this was the most idiotic horror film since blair witch all the character were utterly retarded they had plenty of chances to escape and blew them all duh ! ! ! ! ! ! so the viewer just stops giving a crud when the victims are behaving like screeching buffoons and the ending made no sense whatsoever ! ! ! the ben guy is tried for their deaths sure that makes sense it 's not as though they could n't find the mine where the actual murderer was and get a crudload of dna evidence and dead bodies not to mention the alleged hundreds of other tourists that have gone missing from that exact place total piece of junk a wasted opportunity for all involve	16

0	i purchased this dvd and i was shocked to see the terrible violence and gore especially on innocent animals i wouldn't recommend this dvd to the faint of heart especially to persons under 18 this was certainly a bad choice of purchase on my part	16
1	this dvd is awesome the only problem i have with it is its too short only 4 episodes	16
0	a good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70 's and mid 80 's allen got his name on the directorial map w this piece of fluff you gotta start somewhere tiger lily is more of a dry run for his later real comedies than an original film in its own right allen 's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick a must for allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so bad they 're fun movies	16
0	this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame i love a good suspense horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted	16
0	i watched the first half hour of this and could n't get through it i dislike michael moore as much as anybody but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school it 's an amateurish whining documentary made more for spite \( and those 15 minutes we all want \) than anything else getting called down by michael moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside \( people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night \) does n't prove that michael moore followers are all waffling malcontents dude overall i rate this film fail	16
1	it is a tragedy that brandon lee died while making this film had he lived the crow sequels would have been much better the crow is an action packed movie that moves at a quick pace it set the standard for the dark cinema of the 1990 's	16
1	i recently had a baby boy and felt a quot little quot out of shape after having him \( ha ! \) i did a search on amazon and found this video i got it in 3 days and began right away my son works out with me every day and i could n't be happier ! we both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body and i use him for the weights ! i am also learning about my baby 's development from the video it 's educational and rewarding thanks mbbb	16
1	this is an essential collection for every al pacino fan in carlito s way and scarface he does one of his best work ever then there is the performance that gave him his only oscar so far in a scent of a woman if you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the al pacino collection	16
0	might be a good video it just does n't interest our 10 month old yet like baby einstein does	16
0	seriously i am an expert and this movie sucks but imagine for a moment yes stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound strikingly engaging and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals those `experts' whose tastes likes and dislikes decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all \? besides this interesting question which is put forth explicitly without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry and in about 60 seconds the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs	16
0	this is nothing but a huge dissapointment there 's almost nothing on this video about baseball if there was a rating lower than zero stars i would give it that rating	16
1	this movie is great ! very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud love it	16
0	i bought this because i was familar with the space ghost show and liked it and the fact that this was 50 off it is strange in an uncomfortable way and tends to be very long in parts	16
1	the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good i bought this primarily to see jaco the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 's added in i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances also it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut i still give it 5 stars regardless	16
1	i remember putting season 9 as the worst season of friends in my book but it 's not as bad as i remembered some episodes are actually incredibly funny the faux pas was when they started to have aisha tyler guess star as charlie and have her come between joey and ross also the whole story line with rachel 's infatuation for joey could 've been better executed or should n't have been there at all it got bad towards the end but i'm not disappointed the stuff leadings towards it was classic friends	16
0	i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it i was n't shocked disturbed or upset just bored	16
0	ok so most of the reviews i read for this film said how great it was well i for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing angelina 's breasts the acting was poor the script was stupid and the sets were lame i have seen some pretty bad movies in my time \( ie killer kondom \) but this one took the cake i would watch tromavision flicks over this one any day save your money if you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week	16
1	loved this movie when it first came out and loved it just as much the this time around two of my favorite actors depicting a story that love has no boundaries very funny and moving yes i'm a romantic ! it 's awesome !	16
1	loved them all found victoria amp albert and lorna doone a bit lacking wondered about having more of the scarlet pimpernel offered he 's so smooth ! tom jones is very special loved sophie 's father he truly made the film as much as i liked him hated lizzie 's mother in p amp p what a ninny ! this is a great collection would have liked to see vanity fair and persuasion offered also	16
1	excellent movie that shows how families should be and how most african american families really are big mama 's are always the most important component to a family definitely a collector 's item	16
0	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	16
0	this movie was a sleeper not in the sense that it was a pleasnt surprise but rather it in fact put me to sleep i have 3 suggestions1 avoid2 avoid3 pay close attention to suggestions 1	16
1	these are excellent performances for a very reasonable price the look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is dated but the performances easily shine through not quite as well played recorded or filmed as bernstein 's many later unitel films but still well worth the investment i wo n't spend time on details but rest assured it 's all great stuff !	16
1	this is definately worth the price i cried and laughed watching the perfect story of chi and hedeki beautiful animation great story line	16
0	it is so strange for a famous actor like stallone to play as bad as stowe may be it is competition between them to make you exhausted of watching this film this boring story is about a bodyguard which has been repeated in different films many times the worst is the director who could not manage the film after 15 minutes it made me sleep i regret for the money that i paid for the dvd	16
1	i saw this movie on t v for the first time a few days ago and now i'm buying the dvd i'm not a big fan of action movies but i do watch them now and again i 've read quite a few negative reviews about this film and i think they are undeserved when i saw it i thought it was good not diehard good but it held its own i really enjoyed it i really liked the idea that they included a female member of swat one never sees a woman swat member it looks like this is one of those movies you either love like or hate one has to make up one 's own mind	16
1	i had never watched this film before ordering it so i took the chance it turned out to be a smart buy ! as usual peck is just awesome he seems to fit this role well as if it captures a true part of his persona as a family man as the movie continues you realize that you can relate to the character on a personal level i enojoyed the flashback sequences and thought they were placed well throughout the film overall this movie supplies drama and action for the viewer so if you are considering purchasing this dvd i 'd suggest you buy it you 'll enjoy it	16
1	a terrific documentary even if you have seen it on pbs you need the dvd to view the great extra material	16
1	this dvd is the authorotizzle on the technizzle fo schizzle	16
0	this effort shows it 's age in addition there is a uncomfortable tone in the narration that smacks of a reliance on a pseudo scientific method somewhat reminiscent of mengele i suppose it 's possible for it to be taken as tongue in cheek by those at the post graduate level of study at the cheech and chong school of anthropology however i have to admit i was unable to prevent myself from throwing this one in the trash after one viewing	16
0	we have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500 000 on him and it all goes down hill from there there is no rhyme or reason to the story i gave it two stars because the landscape is great	16
0	i bought the dvd for my collection after watching the film on tcm the musical perfomances are terrific upon receiving the dvd i was very disappointed in the quality of the dvd production the dvd states digital sound but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on tcm	16
1	not a fan of graphic novels or cgi i was fully prepared to dislike this movie but found it to be so well written cast and shot that i will no doubt buy it for my collection it 's a dark movie subversive really but carries a strong message that tyranny will not long survive the will of the people that one strong person with a will determination and the cleverness to use the tools of the corrupt against them can turn the tide it 's a powerful message and it 's beautifully displayed with imaginative imagery symbolism and script bravo	16
1	i'm not sure if anyone has pointed this out but the voice 's for paul and company is not their own these were in fact voice actors and they did a very good job too this was also confirmed by paul proir to the movies release	16
1	this is the 2000 or so version of the dvd this is identical with the vhs version except it adds two features the first is an excellent making of video from 1996 which was re done with a different host for 2006 but all the interview segments are the same the second was a making of video done for the dvd which does n't add a whole lot were i to do it again i 'd buy this version and skip the 2006 50th anniversary release this is the classic chuck jones television grinch in one of the best packages for it and the horton hears a who is also a chuck jones classic a person 's a person no matter how small	16
1	i loved this movie it was very touching and projected a wonderful image it was a rare find	16
0	i did n't know that they made music videos this long if i had known that 's all that this was i would never have watched it this is a horrible film ! save your time and money and avoid this monstrosity !	16
1	i love dancehall queen ! i lost my first copy \( vhs \) so i replaced it with a new copy in dvd i never get tired of watching this movie and i consider it a jamaican movie classic right up there with harder they come rockers and smile orange it is a nice twist on the traditional rags to riches story although her character 's morals are somewhat questionable \( she practically sells her daughter to a high paying local don \) you ca n't help but root for the protagonist marcia	16
1	for me it's great to watch superhero television shows on dvd's because it's worth to own and to watch it all over again again i have adventures of superman the flash lois clark the new adventures of superman and the incredible hulk i'm very dtermieend to own all 3 seasons of wonderwoman i decided to get rid of smallville it did not discribe the idea of the adventures of superman and lois clark the new adventures of superman it did not appeel to me at all these are the shows which i do have on dvd a superhero t v show will never be cancelled it's great towatch everyday or during the weekends epecially saturday sunday morrningschrisburke lifegoeson	16

0	okay i gave a pretty bad review of this dvd originally because it did n't play right but after viewing it without the technical problems i would like to say that it is a pretty good program and given the rarity of the subject matter a good addition to any collection ancient muscle conditioning \? not many dvd 's out there on the subject i 've edited my original review and it wo n't allow me to give it more stars but i 'd give it 4 sorry mr keen if i cost you sales on this i commend you for putting this out	16
1	i thought the movie was great ! nothing like the gospel to me ! ! don't compare ! billoah is sexy baby ! he played zulu ! ! \( pretty eyes \) the movie was very funny also and taught a lesson in love ! ! ! 5 star movie ! !	16
0	the long long trailer is a good movie but too many girls is when lucy and desi were very young and thin but the movie too many girls is awful and forever darling is awful	16
0	im not sure why i gave this a second star maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with \? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman \( the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious adaptation \) this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer \( john cusack \) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz	16
1	together with 'odyssey into the minds eye' two of my favorite dvds in my collection they may be watched forever because the constant change of images and inventions cannot be retained by memory enormous visual pleasure with appropriate soothing sound track there is something healing in this flow of beautiful worlds and mind conceptions	16
1	i totally love this dvd ! they really show how to do grooves not just some moves that you can only do to a specific music video these are grooves you can make your own and go and dance any where with that what i think makes this dvd series totally different from the rest the moves are current and fun and the host and dancers are excellent dancers and also fun to watch it goes slow enough and they turn around backwards to show you how to do it love it ! ! ! love it ! ! ! love it ! ! ! i am hooked on the groovaloos	16
1	house 1 is darker than it 's sequels but stll maintains the horror comedy feel throughout do n't expect to be blown away by outlandish hollywood special effects the majority of the special effects are not special but if you can get over that you 'll enjoy the movie dvd is pretty bare bones with no amazing special features i doubt much of that was available due to the age of the film i'm just happy it was released on dvd ! if you are a fan of low budget horror comedy movies this movie may appeal to you it 's no evil dead but it is an entertaining movie	16
1	the aids situation is far greater than we are told the corruption in africa is horrific the situation is beyond any horror film's scare anytime this film of lecarre's novel bears great importance to our future our destiny one of the most important films ever made ! actors like ralph fiennes rachel weitz need more commendation for it and director fernando merelles is a genius agripping thriller for the serious moviegover bravo 50 stars	16
0	sit down under a tree give it a big hug fire up you bong and go to sleep that 's what i was waiting for freeman to do all movie it 's a shame that special effects that were so ground breaking were waisted on this sci fi hippie flick i'm surprised that freeman 's suit was n't tie dyed keep your money say no to drugs !	16

1	well at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet beware the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while the dvd has a different narrator than the original \( neal morrissey \) videos but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s	16
1	brosnan is great kinnear is really funny a gem of a movie	16
1	this film can be interpreted any number of ways as a farce a tragedy or just plain shakespearean comedy brenda blethyn has in the past acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into saving grace with exquisite skill	16
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	16
0	i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie	16
1	do not pass this one up buy this amazing dvd and your ears will be satisfied	16
0	this movie made no sense to me whatsoever it was n't really funny and it was n't scary the only thing that i got was that he killed zombies or returners as he called theme and was upssed with one i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot but that was the only good thing in the film it was also boring but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you	16
0	five stars for the movie one star for this dvd because it is missing the key scene when clara talks to her parents in their bedroom after marty drops her off the dvd cuts from clara putting her key in the door to marty walking to the bus stop why the scene is cut i have n't a clue	16
1	this has 110 minutes of the 1995 concert performed at symphony hall birmingham also has 3 music videos do n't pay the ferryman missing you separate tables ! !	16
0	when we tried to play the item on our dvd player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it we ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer which worked properly i am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded i can see deducting shipping and handling but a restocking charge that is outrageous ! the merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it ! please remind me not to buy from amazon com	16
1	we love underdogs ! here is a plain girl who finds happiness there is alot more to this character than she is given credit for we 've watched it about 20 times in the past 5 yrs if you like ugly betty or any sort of cinderella type stories this one is for you it is an australian movie	16

0	i was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year a third of a way through it it starting to skip and freeze i played it all the way through but took forever at the ending it was workinhg again but i missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage i guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used wo n't be doing this again !	16
0	great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost did n't finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira 's voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie	16
1	this original version is much funnier than u s version the humor is dry and intelligent and the characters are very complex at times you feel sorry for them other times you love them and laugh with them and mostly you think they 're idiots what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience it 's not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over but this is one that i 've enjoyed each time	16
1	wow how nice to watch sam cooke 's story from beginning to end interviews with the family adds a wealth of inside information i never knew sam 's father was a chicago minister and of course sam was the younger one who surprised the family when he first sang ! unfortunate for music that his life was taken so early after watching this dvd i bought sam cooke music and surpised that some songs are songs i had no idea sam wrote	16
0	appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget cgi enhanced anime theatrical releases have gorgeous visuals but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog trust me i was sucked in by the amazing trailer like most of you i wanted this to be a great movie \( as i am a fan of the oav animated series \) appleseed is worth seeing for the visuals alone but that is about all	16
0	is a bad sequel and have a poor quality of special effects	16
1	i really enjoyed this dvd the instructor is very charismatic unlike most instructional videos he really knows his stuff the only reason i would n't give it 5 stars is because i do n't believe that any dvd or video can really train a person to play an instrument it comes from personal experience not formula	16
1	my whole family \( ages 7 68 \) greatly enjoyed all the horatio hornblower movies together they are well made and great entertainment a very acessible way to learn about the napoleonic wars it gives the viewers a real sense of how highly held personal honor and integrity used to be we ca n't wait for a e to continue the series	16
0	very short game took about 2 hours to finish it \( took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it because as always their system is unavailable please try again later took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable and definately it will be the last steaming product i buy \) as to the game you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary gameplay was average for a shooter it seems episodes basically translates to really short game which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something	16
0	do n't buy this from the grave is overdubbed b w film without bruce lee in it the other two are n't great either	16
1	this video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners i started taking a vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so i looked for a video to supplement my practice at home what a great choice baron baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home i highly recommend this dvd	16
0	i got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development my baby watched about two mintues and was gone i think this is pitched as a baby video but it 's really more geared toward older children none of the elements have anything to do with the music making is virtually useless as a learning development product i give it a big thumbs down try any one of the baby faith products like god made me god made music and god made animals they 're awesome !	16
0	the kit was not worth its price the spatial effect is poor i 've been watching some much better 3d movies with much cheaper red blue paper glasses no i do n't have visual problem and i rigged up everything correctly the dvds itself were not interesting my kids were not impressed much it were not made me happier with the pack sorry this review seems against the others but it is my truth i 've stored it back into the box i do n't recommend this for you	16

1	burt lancaster stars in this tough grim noir drenched prison flick in which a sadistic prison guard \( a young hume cronyn \) manipulates tensions and weaknesses to produce an explosive situation the film 's liberal message butts up against its obligatory quot crime never pays quot ending the convicts are sympathetic but doomed from the word quot go quot a little stagey and lurid but overall tense and suspenseful the ending is a real nail biter recommended	16
1	this was a very interesting movie a friend told me to watch this movie after i told him that i really liked the movie the skeleton key i think i liked the skeleton key better but this was still a really good movie there are a few scenes with nudity in it not a movie for the youngsters we had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end a good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing	16

0	this is not the restored print of dracula 1931 that universal previously released on dvd a few years earlier if you have that dvd keep it as the quality on this box set is awful i can only think that whoever was in charge of compiling this did n't bother to look or did n't know that universal had a fully restored copy of this film	16
0	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	16
1	this is one of my all time favorite vampire movies the cast led by tom cruise as the vampire lestat and brad pitt as the vampire louis does an excellent job of bringing to life anne rice 's interview with the vampire the costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through and the cinematography is lush and sensual evoking the decadent lifestyle that lestat leads even kirsten dunst has a role here as a child vampire and her famous line i want some more has been rendered immortal in movie history the chemistry between lestat cruise louis pitt is believable and in fact they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie all in all a cinematic treat	16
0	this film like most of his early work is for hitchcock aficionados only i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films but i still found this movie tough going not least because of the 110 mins running time the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you 'd expect for the price the musical score is also okay but nothing to write home about laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of this dvd has no commentary no documentary and no trailer not even one of those awful tony curtis intros so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a 'special edition'	16
0	this movie isnt worth the time to read this review it sucks and i'm a big trinity fan my advice is keep searchin	16
0	stay away from all the movies from wesley snipes' and steven seagal 's they are brain dead movies with brain dead screenplays bad directors bad everythings this movie like other viewers' said drove me nuts i have to wear straight jacket to refrain myself everytime when i watched these two guys' movies otherwise i might have crashed my tv set or trashed everything around me in order to vant my frustration amazon com should also stay away from selling this crappy movie god help us	16
0	nothing but self important producer yacking about how accomplished he was at an early age as mere snipnets of what i thought was going to be a movie were shown very disappointing as listing did n't indicate that this was not the full movie uninterupped	16
0	this amicus horror anthology film has got to be the weakest in the series the storylines were terrible and very dull and most of the time it looked like it was very outdated not to mention that the last episode about a washed up actor who turns into a vampire was not funny usually these amicus films are fun to watch and not scary but good however this film just dragged along the episode with christopher lee in it was the best one and the only one that was worth watching and ingrid pitt as a sexy vampire thats it what a waste	16
1	i bought this dvd collection to use in a presentation i made for a graduate school class to complement a book review of murrow this collection is facinating for people who love murrow and those who 've never seen his work i will use this collection in future presentations that i 'll make to my students as a professor every person in broadcasting should buy this collection and watch it to get a great look at the man who innovated our business	16
0	i loved the rm and expected the same level out of this movie but my husband 's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest the teenagers did n't even want to check it out after that scene they also loved the rm if you can get it from the library go ahead but do n't spend money on it	16
1	richard dreyfuss is excellent as a cop on a stakeout \( along with partner emilio estevez \) of pretty madeleine stowe \( they have to watch her house through the night \) and he falls in love with her before the movie is over there 's a big car chase and an exciting climax in a lumber mill with a killer \( aidan quinn \) it 's pretty standard fare for this kind of cop movie but the script is above average especially the dialogue and dreyfuss 's performance is right on target a very entertaining movie definitely worth a watch	16
0	when i first got this disc the other day it would not play at all i installed the latest firmware update to my xbox360 hd drive and it played however it does not play well at all the video is constantly dragging or skipping the audio is fine though i ca n't really provide a review of the content since so far it is unwatchable this is the only disc that has given me issues	16
0	the quot latin quot moves in this workout seem strangely like american aerobics to me you can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves but if you 're interested in latin dance my advice is to buy brazilian dance workout with vanessa isaac instead this workout just is n't as energetic and fast paced as it looks	16
0	i an not a prude but i watched this movie after it was recommended by a friend i watches this movie with a pretty liberal girlfriend and we both found it to be extremely vulgar and not even funny with the exception of the fist scene and the language was ridiculous and gross ! yuk	16
0	the fridays gang steals some diamonds mike epps is not chris tucker no matter how hard he tries to be his constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve plus everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that i do n't know where to begin whatever you do do n't buy or rent this garbage wait to catch it on tbs or something	16
0	i ordered this dvd series because i liked kristy alleys performance in other movies and series but this is totally different a lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted after viewing two episodes i put it in the trash watching this does not make me happy	16
0	this is the first and only dvds i will buy from this company this could be possibly the worst instructional videos that you could buy i learned absolutely nothing and the women were disgusting trust me do not buy this dvd if your life depends on it	16
1	the movies of course are dated but fascinating also the picture quality was excellent as was the sound the main iterest was in seing how much movie stories have changed now even the simplest movie regardless of the subject has an edge these horror movies of the 40s 50s are gentler less scary with a clear statement of good and evil now we view things differently without any absolute judgments clarity has given way to a more unsettled world	16
1	this is a great collection i can remember every saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on it 's truly a great dvd that not only i can enjoy but my son is hooked on it now too	16
0	my boys have grown up with dave hood playing all sort of characters like busdriver dave pilot dave and fireman dave i was excited to get this new dvd as my youngest is crazy for tractors and dump trucks unfortunately there 's a new dave \( kind of like the change that took place in blues clues \) and it 's just not the same the new dave is not bad perse but after years of dave hood 's cheesy grin i ca n't say that we watch this one much if at all	16
1	excellent presentation and goes into detail much of which may be unknown to the viewer one minor criticism the participants let stanley lord of the californian off much too easily	16
0	the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor but there 's no mystery	16
0	this was just a boring movie ca n't understand the otherreview 's saying it 's good would n't reccomend it	16
0	highly acclaimed that i knew i watched the first 30 minutes which is 1 4 of the movie before i decided to hang it up new lady moves into a conservative french town and opens a chocolate shop this upsets the local church even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate okay can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot \? nope this one 's boring	16
1	this movie helps brings to life what you have read in the bible about john and future world events you must see this movie	16
0	about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who 's not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick incestuous and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood do n't watch this	16
1	this was purchased as a gift for my sister she has said that the dvd set is great she is a fan of alias	16
1	exactly what i thought i was purchasing shipped quickly definately would recommend this seller	16
0	overall i have always enjoyed robin william and billy crystal 's performance in many other movies but i must admit to my surprise that it was n't making me laughing on the floor as i usually do the script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing did n't like the ending it was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it 's normal for mothers to lie i hope someday to see both robin and billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	16

1	pretty good ! my brother is a huge elmo fan and he loves the elmos world dvd`s ! this is his fourth favorete one ! he watches it almost every two days	16
0	this is an excellent film which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor i was very disapointed in the quality of the release the picture quality is poor inter titles appear to be missing and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that do n't match the action on screen it 's a shame because a film like this one deserves much better	16
0	i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here so i was upset when i watched this sad movie gary graham \( t v 's alien nation \) is a robot jox which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought ! the f x are not very good and the story is paper thin only the acting is good but it ca n't save this one from being just a let down skip it	16
1	they do n't make films like this today it 's a scathing smart funny and thought provoking look at tv news but more importantly it 's a great film about complicated people and their relationships	16
0	movie boring story drags barely any action if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing booo	16
0	i bought the movie on accout rose was on the cover i got home and watched and in the end i was disappointed and in tears this movie is not for people under eighteen cause of some of the stuff she doe	16
1	this movie is pure fun my whole family loved it it 's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it 's amatuer hour but its fun to watch we made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing watch it and enjoy	16
1	i ca n't wait to all the seasons of dallas are available	16
0	this was a hugely disappointing film i did not see it on stage nor do i want to if it is ever resurrected it trivializes illness death god heaven range of human emotion and love in all forms i have grown up in a post aids world and can see so many problems far worse than aids i am tired of listening to actors drone on in selfish pursuits while america focuses on such banal subject matter larger more urgent problems are clearly ignored by a society that thinks it has the luxury of still trying to come to grips with sexuality	16
1	the incredibles together with finding nemo shrek 1 2 madagascar and the spy kids series certainly mark a turning point in terms of animated moviemaking particularly the incredibles is a movie no kid \( or adult as well \) will ever get tired of watching as for the plot it is just plainly great things have been kind of boring for superheroes since they have been forced to give up their superpowers and adopt a conventional lifestyle but everything will change for mr incredible and his family when an interesting business proposal will ultimately make him wear his superhero suit again for an exciting new job my kids just love this movie \( and so do i !	16
1	tom cruise gives an excellent performance as imf agent ethan hunt who is framed for murder after the death of his imf team together with the help of two other imf agents hunt sets out to find the real murderer cornered most of the movie and set to his limits hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants it all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker brian depalma	16
0	way too expensive for a low quality product the clarity of the picture is poor there is not enough content to justify the price i do n't recommend it at all i feel i 've been cheated	16
1	it 's not a great movie but it 's a lot of fun this is one of those movies that just catches me it 's quirky and has some decent \( for it 's day \) effects there are a feww laugh out loud momments truth be told they are few and far between some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble the cast is pretty damn cool with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman angellica houston john mat mattus the big guy anyway it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot hey what do you want \? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been i still giggle at the time warp battle	16
0	what a great cast ! i mean looking at this line up you just have to watch this movie right \? after it starts it is so mesmerizingly awful that you still have to watch it although you are shaking your head in disbelief ! stunning ! you 've never seen anything quite like it ! if you are a fan of the campy awful you may see it as a masterpiece if not you will still have a unique viewing experience proceed at your own risk ! borrow or rent it before plunking down your hard earned cash to buy it did i mention the great cast \? so many of my favorites even goodman ca n't save this clunker	16
0	it has been a couple years since i 've seen this and i can still honestly say that it 's like watching a andy warhol movie of salvor dail puking a kind of swirly colorful mess with brendan fraser and bridget fonda stuck in the ooze of ick and ca n't escape it 's yuck of a screenplay on a positive note jim carrey is n't in it other then that nothing can redeem henry selick kaja blackley and sam hamm for this putrid monstrosity and i mean that from the bottm of my heart	16
1	this was an easily understandable view of the complex structure of the universes held by modern physics it is found facinating by the common man	16
1	perhaps the greatest cinematic experience of our generation although i believe i was in a different state of mind when i watched this stuff in college brilliant	16
0	as someone said in an earlier review the movie is split up into two parts the first part training camp was good i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam after that i found it unwatchable the main character is so annoying i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast if you 're looking for a good war movie look elsewhere	16
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	16
0	this is a terrible movie when it came out in 1956 it was a box office bomb even though both stars were at the height of their powers time had only added to it 's mediocrity	16
0	i only bought this one for the song by jerry orbach the first 2 dvds were better	16
0	there are not many movies i have switched off after the first 30 minutes but this is one of them and i recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise	16
0	if there is one thing michael bay is good at it 's explosions big 'ol explosions there are a lot of them in this film along with a painful to watch romantic scene involving animal crackers this is a film that ben affleck billy bob thornton \( both in the film \) admit to being ashamed of pure leave your brain at the door entertainment	16
1	the movie is about two men who fake fairytales for money they are employed to stop these children from disapearing into a forest in a town wilhelm and jacob grimm take on the job or be forced to die and go into the forest this is a really good movie and is an action packed fairytale	16
1	this is the only movie that i really like made by woody allen but is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen	16
1	wow ! i had forgotten how powerful a story was told with a wonderful haunting score to match i'm glad our pleas have been heard ! with new high definition equipment coming down in price i ca n't think of a better movie to view for all with discriminating tastes and those will discover the finer aspects of the cinema update is this the region 2 4 version that was released overseas \? if so we are in for a real treat !	16
0	incredible i saw one review describing this production the meaning of the word must have been changed in the dictionary because this is not incredible it is slow convoluted and uninspired no chemistry exists between the actresses with no connection to the audience	16
0	this movie was awfull supertroopers was awsome and beerfest was even better so i suppose they can be forgiven for this cinematic abortion	16
1	i encourage anyone who enjoys superman and wants to relive a bit of your childhood in fun filled nostalgia to purchase the entire series of the adventures of superman \( played by george reeves \) the full set of all the episodes consists of 12 packed dvd 's \( i got mine all at once in a 3 pack collection saving a little \) this is your chance to view the entire superman tv series from the first episode to the last \( prematurely ending with the death of george reeves \)	16
1	after being into the techno scene since my first party in 1993 this is one of the best videos i have seen describing the dj feelings you really get a feel for how a dj thinks if you at all interested in the dj lifestyle or are interested in djing this is a must have it have great insights in the minds of some of the best djs around plus nigel richards does a great job with the how to dj part not only is this for the newbies but for those who have been around a bit plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms wow that sounded like an infomercial	16
1	simply the most entertaining mockumentary film i 've seen in years and one of the best ever the dvd is packed full of extras and outtakes so the fun lasts much longer than you 'd expect jenna fischer is brilliant and james gunn is hilarious you just have to buy it to understand	16
0	i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college and because he spoke so highly of it i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it i definitely regret that decision if you 're thinking of buying it rent it first it was dull and obnoxious not to mention weird the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate \( which is why i gave it 1 star instead of 0 \) however if you 're still interested definitely rent it you might enjoy it	16
1	the muppets take manhattan will keep your children imused from the very begining the music in cordination with the muppets of all different kinds keep the minds of young children going at all times i would recomend this movie would be great for children starting at age 2 5 and older	16
1	this movie is perfect for people in their 40ies and or 50ies it just hits the bullseye lean back and enjoy the ride	16
1	the league of extraordinary gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie its pretty good itself where else could you ever hope to see the likes of captain nemo dorin gray mina harker the invisible man dr jeckyl mr hyde allan quatermain tom sawyer all in the same movie \? about the only character the production is lacking is sherlock holmes the action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors the only real drawback is the length about 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes all in all a good popcorn flick	16
0	i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed	16
0	guess i'm in the minority about this but this play \( not a movie \) left me thinking that i wasted my money i enjoyed madea she is a great character i never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems for me the only thing funny about it was when madea took the stage the rest of it was simply boring	16
1	it is an excellent movie very well directed and the acting is superb it awakens the natural instincts of empathy compassion and love for children all over the world are the same ir respective of color or ethnicity	16
1	this is a great tape for anyone who wants a challenge ! you will deinately feel it in the legs i have the ultimate step circuit and burn and firm and prefer this one as it seems to take you to depletion until you ca n't do anymore karen voight is excellent at cueing and reminding about technique comparable to the firm lower body split another 5 star recommendation for feeling the burn	16
0	one of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie low budget unispired performances \( alexis denisof is particularly bad here \) lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon bad direction despisable characters cliched situations how kinski chose to act in this one \?	16
0	i had heard a lot about how funny margaret cho was and finally got a chance to watch her video i find her way overrated she does have some funny stuff she 's got a particular knack for doing impressions and there 's some other genuinely funny material however the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience she does a lot of vulgar material homosexual oriented jokes etc that are clearly just there for the outlaw value and she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she 's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base it 's just not funny	16
1	i love this movie it 's picture perfect in a life of a tweeker and their enviroment where is the soundtrack to this movie \? \? \? \? \?	16
0	it is not good as a mainstream movie it does not have a good plot some scenes are not relevant even as a soft porn movie it does not do a good job try watching i like to play games its a much better soft porn movie	16
0	this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film 's mood i'm not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition 's music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge of the seat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition	16
1	this is one of the best animes i 've ever seen what does it for me is the same people that drew cowboy bebop has now drawn wolf 's rain i love the music played in the series that 's why they made a cd came along with also a stuff amimal wolf i wish their was a second season cause i began to love the show	16
0	the ab portion of the dvd is good although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set the last one is a step type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on you ca n't do it the dvd itself is not very professionally done tamilee miscounts does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words abs of steel maybe buns of steel no way	16
0	this dvd was a waste of money and a waste of time it 's unauthorized by muse so therefore there were no interviews no live footage and none of their music was included they interviewed people who had never even met the band i learned nothing new from watching it do n't waste your money	16
1	5 classic films by one of the best african american directors of all time for 20 00 ! if you think this isn't a great deal than obviously there is a problem ! mo betta blues is one of the most well put together pieces and if you enjoy the films i suggest listening to the actual soundtracks	16
1	we purchased this dvd because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it 's a great supplement to reading books he loves this dvd and we love the variety in it 's approach we did n't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years	16
0	i turned the movie off was that supposed to be funny \? yes some kids' toy \( that happens to be a small motorized electric model of a truck \) attacks one unfortunate postman on his route through some deserted village i mean was this taken from the original stephen king book then shame on you mr king that 's overdoing the terror already so overdone not that the consept of trucks did n't appeal to me but this must be perhaps the weakest adaption of the so called horrormaster so far believe it or not	16
0	travolta was great in saturday night fever but this country version just did n't work although he 's a good actor he just was wrongly cast in this film	16
0	i was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between the gospel and the fighting temptations i would not recommend purchasing you are better off renting	16
0	i am a fan of dbz i am a fan of goten i think hercule is funny and i think 18 is hot yet this movie sucked ! it was missing what makes dbz so great lots of action and a great plot broly is overused and this completely ruins him like most dbz movies it does n't fit into the timeline if we worked it in then goten and trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the fusion technique had this movie taken place after then the fight would be a lot more interesting in short if you want to see every dbz movie then rent it if you insist on collecting the whole series wait until movie collection 4 comes out	16
1	this is a fantastic movie ! the acting is superb and it keeps you guessing until the end nicole kidman deserved her oscar	16
1	this is fantastic ! great music great story awesome photography ! i promise you will love this film	16
0	do not buy ! ! ! great movie bad studio ! ! it has been announced that new line is replacing peter jackson as the director of the hobbit the only way to stop this injustice is to hit them were it hurts the wallet do not buy or see anything new line till the hobbit is returned to its rightful director ! ! !	16
0	i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets however i have to say this video was not what i expected there were some great vintage clips but not enough muppets monsters for me this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing i would recommend you pass on this one and get 123 count with me instead	16
1	this film is a must see for any dancer the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be for ballet dancers there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a must own selection for any dancer	16
0	i enjoy greek mythology and i love this story although there was alot of bad acting especially from the lead character jason who acted like he was stoned throughout the film i was expecting the hydra guarding the golden fleece but got a oversized komoto dragon \( lost me there \) this film had potential but the director went off on some wierd drug indused trip overall i was dissappointed and was expecting more sorry	16
0	i really like bruce campbell and his movies like army of darkness but this movie is not in the same league first of all the plot is slow and boring bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move this really hampers the action aspects of the movie the dialogue aspect is not much better if you like bruce my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the tv episodes of jack of all trades episodes it is a lot more fun and has the real bruce	16
1	a dvd with a message that pulls at the heart and presents sadness and then joy to the viewer strong singing cast with excellent voices a must see	16
0	spare me another movie about how the big bad catholic church makes life dull and arduous until everybody is rescued by a sexually liberated mary poppins the film 's agenda is all over it and binoche 's character is just too practically perfect in every way	16
0	imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing then you would have battlefield earth it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project just awful if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed	16
0	watched like reading a comic book so many murders for so little money corpses never turned stink in the thailand humid and hot temperature lousy acting directing and totally stupid screenplay with twisted to the limit ridiculousness and impossibility a story so bad that turned into a disturbing watch boasted with awards and high praises for the primitiveness or roughness of the poor plot and scenario \? give me a break	16
1	my son was over 2 before we introduced be videos there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons unlike some of the other be 's with random visuals here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons and no i did n't care for the commercial either	16
1	i saw wirey spindell in theater in new york and i thought itwas awesome ! i had never heard of it before but it is a trueendorsement of indie films if you love laughing you 'll love this movie i loved devin matthews johnson and eric mabius too they 're both so cute	16
1	i loved this movie it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it this did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a tv show that was made into a movie	16

1	really delightful and has stood the test of time my recording had a few hic cups with the lighting in one of the acts music lovely as were the costumes and scenery can recommend	16
0	for those of you looking for more eva action after seeing the original series take heed don't buy this dvd ! the death part of the dvd part 1 is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season and the second half rebirth part 2 is new stuff very good but ! if you buy 'the end of evangelion' you get rebirth and a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material so do n't buy 'death rebirth' buy 'the end of evangelion' instead	16
0	until this date i did not receive this prooduct \? what is happening \? i alredy wrote to you about this problem an d i am waiting for a solutionregardsmario assa	16
1	i saw the original about 4 5 times from 1970 1971 this one is not much different just modestly i had been attempting to purchase this flick for 30 years but was unable because the studio \( warner bros \) refused to release it under any format i was thrilled that it was finally released and have since been watching it with many friends most had no idea this movie was ever out i was particularly interested in anita palenburg she has really changed over the last 38 years the content may be a bit provacative for most \( sex and violence \) but the quality are extraodinary for that era this one is a must for anyone	16
0	this thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours characters were n't given clear introductions or motivations they react in ways that do n't make much sense and the accents come go and change into new accents altogether while the format reminds me of a primetime soap the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	16
0	jack nicholson in this shameless attempt at comedy plays a dog trainer of all professions who gets involved with an oprea singer who is caught up in the underworld of crime critcally embarssing to nicohlson 's carrer but jack has done much better to cover this mistake a minor film with good talent gone to waste a film way below par considering the re teaming of director bob rafelson amp nicholson from quot five easy pieces quot	16
0	the depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned from the moment they reached king kong 's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience i felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape how can anyone feel anything for king kong \? he keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island forces them to provide him sacrificial women and tortures the female star of the movie it seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking king kong the villains of the movie were my heroes i kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end	16
1	well it 's a great inteligent comedy which makes enjoy to everyone who whatches it i'm form spain and i bought the other three seasons in france i 'll buy it from amazon but i would like to know if in england the other seasons offered subtitles in spanish thanks	16
0	its probably alright if you like stuff like this but i dont	16
1	great movie and musical numbers courtesy of quincy jones and the wonderful cast	16
1	this is simply one of the best detective story ever made and jerry goldsmith 's sound track \( which i also own \) is probaby the best sound track it was his favorite jack faye john are at their best	16
1	i saw this movie on tv years ago and loved it i thought the storyline was terrific there 's plenty of action family situations love interest but mostly this movie engages you it forces you to care about the characters it 's a great movie three words keep tissues handy	16
0	i saw this at a friends house so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot not even lukewarm for that matter the acting is terrible please anyone who had anything to do with this do n't continue in the film industry if it was possible to assign negative stars i would do so for this awful experience run away	16
0	i gotta say this movie is an example of a terrible idea swain husband beats the crap outta her and she spends her time running from him what 's worse his friend is a lunatic who want swain 's character swain 's character is a hillbilly who like 's an upper class doctor who she really never connects with i never really got why swain settled for a lunatic when she was trying to find inner peace thru the whole movie this movie puts a bad taste in my mouth it was a waste of my time it wasnt a story it was an excuse to make a bad movie \( do not buy \)	16
1	the wolf man legacy set a no brainer like all the classic universal legacy sets the special features are worth the price alone jack pierce 's make up and wolfman creation are still the best ! this set along with dracula and frankenstein legacy collections enables you to see the entire series in order as sequels to the inferior but still hard to dislike monster rallies they would end with you still need abbott and costello meets frankenstein to truely complete the series	16
1	i only watched this because joseph d'onofrio is in it this movie is totall genious though	16
1	this is a well written thoughtful film charlie hunnam \( pete \) really stands out to me he 's perfectly cast compelling to watch and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his mates it was especially interesting to watch his relationship with elijah wood 's character evolve the whole concept of an american being immersed in the british football scene is a unique one and i think it was pulled off really well the lessons that elijah wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must see	16
0	over half of this movie consists of scenes taken from the original 1939 classic film directed by zoltan korda even those scenes ca n't disguise the remake 's network tv movie quality beau bridges is generally a good actor but he is terribly miscast on this film go rent both versions of the four feathers and see it for yourself	16
1	this was a great movie for me because my daughter did this dance routine in a school production 15 years ago and we both wanted to see the movie over and over again	16
