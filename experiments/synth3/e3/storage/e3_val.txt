0	this video did not live up to my expectations i have a five year old chihuahua who is somewhat afraid of people and lunges and bites when strangers get too close the description of the video promised a simple behavior modification program to help deal with his aggression instead ian dunbar simply says that behavior like this in old dogs is very difficult deal with and focuses on puppy socialization in the video well that 's great if i had a puppy but i adopted an older dog and i need help now i do n't recommend this video for owners of older dogs with biting problems if you have a puppy it might be somewhat helpful but there are better books	0

1	i ended up getting a total of 6 of these units for all the trucks at my work overall they work fairly well no problems jumping our work trucks chevy 1500 work trucks and a couple ford f150 's the light comes in handy the air compressor does take a while to fill up a tire and the hose is kinda short but it does work other than that it works great and has a built in battery tester which is nice to see i have no problem getting multiple jumps in between charges it recommends charging them once a month even if you do n't use them 4 5 star	0

0	i am a 20 year user of several remington products but i must admit they missed the mark in improving this shaver the remington es 1000 utra smooth bump control shaver was designed to replace the original \( bms \) black man 's shaver which was discountinued several years ago i recently purchased and used the es 1000 and was quite disappointed with its performance the es 1000 performed so poorly that i had to use my bms that i had purchase 20 years ago to remove facial hair the es 1000 shaver could not and did not remove the product should be called ultra poor with a sandpaper finish the product needs to be put to death by using an ultra smooth bullet for anyone with curly hair problems you may want to consider comparing this product against the wahl 5 star series model 8061 i think you will find there is a major difference in the products	0

0	i have known canon to be a very high quality company however i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800 i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400 for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine however if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime this camera is worse than a disposable camera first there is no red eye reduction it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red eye reduction second pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod third night picture \? forget about it i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed so i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non blurry pictures looks like i 'll be back in the market for a fujifilm after all the reviews i 've read i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop \( e18 lcd etc \) not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about	0
0	if you crave a gay themed film full of brooding obsession gloomy \( and very well done \) night photography the occasional graphic sex scene and metaphors so obvious even a high school film class could catch them then this just might be your cup of tea howewver if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject then you are out of luck to be fair portugese director jo o pedro rodrigues has made some daring choices here dialogue is minimal this might as well be a silent film with sound effects he 's working one of the great themes the boundary between dream and reality and the dangers of ignoring that boundary there is the further theme of sexual oppression triggering further oppressions and yes there is more than a little boundage mixed in \( this is no 50s mgm musical \) it looks good night photography lots of backlight and black surfaces either dull or glittering sergio \( played by ricardo meneses a garbageman in lisbon drifts further and further into his obsession with a hunky young swimmer \( and sergio is pretty hunky himself \) while not obsessing he drifts from one random sexual encounter to another finally he goes off the beam completely \( i wo n't go into all the details in case you decide to see it \) the problem is the same that so many self consciously arty films from greed to the unbearable lightness of being share their metaphors are too obvious \( here among others it 's human and animal behavior sergio 's best relationship is with his dog and he lapses into canine behavoir periodically \) and they are just too long o fantasma would make a pretty good 40 minutes festival film at 90 minutes it just drags particularly the ending with sergio wandering interminably in a landfill in a rubber bondage suit \( come to think of it kind ofan echo of the equally tedious final sequence of greed \) i admit it i really have n't the patience for films that scream out how artful they are and have little or nothing except style attitude and angst style and attitude think fred astaire can be a winning combination unfortunately in spite of lashings of kink and plenty of existential hysteria this is not a winning film basically it 's a bore	0

1	i recently purchased the gofit 40lb weighted vest and it 's everything i hoped it would be i was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts and this vest has proved to be a good choice the weight is balanced well between front and back of my body the shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks the velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement i have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting though it does hamper some bending movements the weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter i am well pleased with my purchase	0
0	this software is a waste of money to say the least the templates on this software are terrible and ugly you are lucky if you have five good templates to choose from if you are looking for something quick and easy to use this is not it you have to format everything please do n't make the same mistake i made do not buy this product	0
1	its no secret that i'm not a fan of point clicks they seem to be harder in general on my computer than 3 d action games which is something i 'll never understand \( unless it has to do with the copy protection software \) i 've played through three or four of the drew games secret of the old clock was the most fun for me i liked the golf game and the sewing project i actually was proud when i finished the sewing side quest i liked driving around in the car in retrospect its analogous to guiding a magnet through a maze i had fun none the less i stumbled a little with the cb radio that got a little convoluted and bizarre but i did it the other games were either too hard or too easy this one will keep you occupied for a little while this one will employ an element of fun mar	0

1	as both a big fan of this movie and a film student i feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash this film has a sexy edge to it that many other films in the teen film genre dare to exhibit new best friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night without it actually becoming a reality the house is every girl 's dream and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting the acting is far from terrible and it was great to see meredith monroe in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as andie in dawson 's creek dominique swain once again puts in an a effort for her role as the cheeky deviant sydney for anyone who loved films like tart and cruel intentions this is the film for you	0
1	takes great pics and the 3 screen is really nice wall plug in recharger is nice also i have taken pics outside in sunny overcast rainy conditions indoors at sporting events and around the house in all settings the pics have been truly wonderful a few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics however as canon 's top of the line powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom 3x isnt enough when other cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom also image stabilzation should be included	0
1	fraser 's film is truly a winner in production quality his attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film eye candy performers lighting fantastic musical score and riske scenes this film has visually appealing sequences if anyone is interested in film and theatrical production i would highly recommend the director 's commentary you really get an insight to an artist in process from the commentary it seems that fraser will never be finished with this film a mentale that i admire in an artist art is a process and is never perfect this is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future this film does explore the 3 dimensionality of people i did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide i feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs i had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as selfish gay guy ruins a marriage \( on the other hand cherilee taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script she was n't quite the victim her character ultimately could have become \) by the end of the film i was wondering how violet was making it as a once again as single woman from an audience 's standpoint we did n't really see that david and kryla make up matt goes to illustration school but what happens to violet \? overall i would highly recommend this film with such a great interpretation on the screen it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres	0
1	we bought these because there was an online coupon for them my children \( ages 11 and 14 \) take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices the price was right and with the free shipping when going over 25 it was hard to resist the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor they are a nice change and we 're really enjoying them	0
0	it reminded me of when i got mud in my mouth while playing diggers in the garden as a child ! sorry but this was n't for me i'm affaid the water just turned black and it tasted 'earthy'	0
0	maybe it 's just me but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie it 's an incredibly small production \( 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film \) with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest either \( and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie \) if you are an alan rickman fan chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these do n't let the promise of a nude scene convince you to buy this movie honestly alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very dialogue heavy film and the dialogue is not well written enough to carry it off	0

0	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for	0

0	i expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called quot batteries quot number one i was disappointed to find out after some scientific analyses i performed on them that duracell 's world famous quot copper top quot statement is erroneous this so called quot copper top quot is nothing more than a copper aluminum alloy called copposyclamatrane i ca n't top the copper top \? hardly after the analyses i put these quot copper top quot batteries to the test what i did was i stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike like sheen what i got was far from a tiny light that could only be classified as much less than miniscule i threw the flashlight at my cat in disgust expecting hilarious results and i was n't disapointed ! this was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision i 've ever made thanks for nothing dura hell	0

1	i have to get on the bandwagon here this is a superb little camera definately five stars ! i also have the tz1 which showed promise but has limitations in my review of the tz1 i noted it had lots of noise and pictures should n't be printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they were to be sharp i also wanted more manual controls the tz3 fixes and improves almost everything about the tz1 and adds some new very useful features the noise has been drastically reduced the lens is better the sensor is bigger and the processor is not only faster but produces better pictures the tz3 adds a very handy function button or i should say function capability the number of buttons is the same which gives immediate access to five or so most used settings without having to go into the menues of which there are several the tz3 keeps the mega optical image stabilization and adds intelligent iso increases the sensitivity without adding noise \( i have not tried the 3200 setting yet \) increases the size of the viewing screen etc etc the tz3 is a well rounded and very capable camera there is simply no comparison between the tz1 and the tz3 as far as the quality of the pictures the tz3 wins hands down in my opinion it also beats some big name higher priced digicams a couple of which i own rather handily of course the big selling point for the tz3 is still the 10x lens now with wide angle capability on a pocket sized point and shoot camera this lens is sharp and combined with larger sensor and the new processor yields some excellent results while there are no manual controls per se the camera seems to do very well without them pictures are sharp exposures seem nicely done \( have n't tried it at night yet but low light forrest shots were excellent \) colors were accurate appropriately saturated and vivid \( ok i like the vivid setting \) good contrast etc there are a variety of af settings settable focal points and focus modes there is also exposure compensation and exposure bracketing available and they work well ! the live histogram is a welcome bonus the tz3 focuses down to about 2 inches in macro mode again with excellent sharp results the tz3 is very well speced out one nice thing that is gone is the lens cap on the tz1 it was really not to inconvenient but seemed always to be swinging in the wind to add yet another source of camera shake the tz3 lens includes an built in lens cover very welcome i currently own five top flight digicams \( including this one \) and have owned about that many others i am most impressed with this one for combined convenience and results it is a quantum step forward i also have a couple of quite nice and fairly complete dslr kits they are wonderful and in a class by themselves but when i want very nice pictures and the convenience of a pocketable point and shoot with a 10x wide angle lens or a back up for the dslrs the tz3 is now my camera of choice	0
1	my wife and i have adjoining offices and we keep a variety of soups and snacks on hand so we can eat in together when we do n't both have time to eat out this soup is one of our favorites we like the flavor and the texture \( creamy with nice chunks of potato lots of corn kernels pieces of carrot and bell pepper \) i keep a bottle of hot pepper on hand to spice it up but my wife prefers it as it is we microwave it in the envelope and then pour it into two mugs there 's just the right amount in one evelope for the two of us when i have a sandwich to go with it without the sandwich i find one envelope about right for me this is n't the healthiest of the pacific foods soups that we 've tried in terms of fat protein carbohydrate content the beef stew is better in that regard but we do n't like the beef stew without considerable extra seasoning \( and it 's very thin for a stew \) and we like the creaminess of this chowder we eat a balanced diet so that really is n't an issue this is very satisfying and it 's the one office food item we order again and again	0

1	at a recent nye event i shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness clarity of this lens performance its so fast and the colors are vibrant i am not a seasoned pro but with the 20d and this lens it makes me look pretty close i did shoot in manual and once i got my aperture shutter speed dialed in it pumped out a lot of great pics i have also shot some pics of waterfalls \( slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image \) and portraits of people and again it oozed excellence the 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience	0

1	this is our third baby monitor the first two had static if you would plug anything into the same outlet or get them near other electronic devices this one has worked flawlessly in our home w zero static the talkback feature is also wonderful for a three year old \( go back to sleep i 'll get you juice in the morning etc \) not having to get up and go to the child 's room is a real feature the only reason i gave it four stars is because it only has two channels and because the signals are n't encrypted anyone else with an fm receiver can pick up your conversations but most monitors are this way we took the monitor to a friend 's house and it picked up a lot of static interference from something in the house \( video monitor tv i do n't know \) since it only had two channels we were not able to find a clear channel overall thoughts best monitor i 've had \( stay away from the fisherprice models \) i would buy again unless i was in an apartment complex \( i would n't want other people listening in \) and i would be prepared to take it back if i needed more channels	0
0	i needed a document management system after looking for software there only appeared to be paperport i had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files i guessed a large number meant 2500 at least this concerned me so i called pre sales at scansoft and asked if it was slow with a large number of files he was not sure ! so he told me to call technical i called technical and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me i asked if he was reading the scansoft website and he said yes so i hung up obviously i read their site for an answer and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it i got the software basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software it worked well and i thought ok expensive for what it is when windows explorer and scanning software \( usually free \) would nearly do most of it but then after around 560 pdfs it started running very slow i thought it was my machine so installed it and the pdfs on a new vaio 1 7mhz 1 gig laptop same problem if you click to view the pdf then hit the return back it takes 12 seconds ! so if you view a document it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the paperport desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds ! ! ! completely unusuable ! if you have less than 500 files it is maybe expensive software but for more than 500 do not waste you money it runs so slow you can not use it i wonder how scansoft get away with it surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files	0
1	the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u s constitution thomas jefferson once wrote i read no newspaper now but ritchie 's and in that chiefly the advertisements for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper letter to nathaniel macon january 12 1819 the nation is not a newspaper rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv does n't dare to those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation left wing liberal radical etc etc plato had written 2 300 years ago his allegory of the cave behold ! human beings living in an underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads plato 's punchline was and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him \? and so dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans cannot stand to look into directly it is much less painful for them simply to say the nation 's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world situation for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation it prints the patriotic incisive truth	0

their male neighbors as a cry for help she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub she survived the incident after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr and mrs lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age mr and mrs lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party some of the neighborhood 's boys are invited over and while the party is in session cecilia is pretty inanimate sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt talk and laugh midway through the party cecilia asks to be excused and mrs lisbon though somewhat reluctantly allows it cecilia goes up to her room \( on the second floor of a two story house \) and jumps out the window landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house in this way cecilia lisbon commited suicide only four girls remain the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed the father saw her immediately the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum four of the lisbon 's neighbors four young boys suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world they got hold of cecilia 's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window she thought she would fly with their youngest sister gone the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other stranding themselves further from the outside world when school starts again they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened not ever mentioning their youngest sister the run of the mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word death and the like trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school the object of desire to all of the girls at school except for the lisbon girls which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty in the beginning he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she 's not interested but after his consistent courtship lux falls for his charming ways trip then attempts to convince mr lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming after mr lisbon talks to his wife he agrees to trip 's request knowing nothing but trip 's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew after trip explains the situation to his football peers he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely meanwhile the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance though one pattern is used for all four dresses each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail once they pick up the girls they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke they then drive to the dance trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow but leave soon afterwards not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew they are all there except for trip and lux who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field deciding they must make their own curfews therese bonnie mary and their dates leave without them after fooling around the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick \( of course \) but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence the girls in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls soon following the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone one day the girls invite the boys to come over once mr and mrs lisbon are asleep the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere the boys hastily agree they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese bonnie and mary verbally expressing their hopes for the night but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters she had hung herself the boys scared to death run all the way home time passed things changed girls came and went but no matter what those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides ultimately the movie was nothing short of queer when trying to sum up the story in a few lines \( such as follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors a story full of obsession gossip lust love desire and isolation \) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing but the story fell short of that for me personally partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation the movie in places is also extremely flawed i do not believe mr and mrs lisbon could 've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services in many parts of the movie they should 've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored i would only suggest this film to perhaps people who like movies such as elizabethtown which kirsten dunst is also in but i personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future	0

0	i did what i think is a fair amount of reseach before buying this product and the euro pro was bad decision the product would n't even turn on much less work the packaging indicated it had passed qulaity control whatever that means this was a christmas gift that totally flopped the euro pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and i assumed the price was equal to the quality boy was i wrong if you 're purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands this will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another euro pro too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to deepfried japanese dumplings for christmas a real disappointmen	0
1	i throughly enjoyed this game the voice acting may not be the greatest but i think the gameplay is really well done and the atmospheres are fantastic the controls take some getting used too and are not for everyone they are a problem and could have been better to control surprisenly i can do it very well the major problem i have is that as the game progresses it gives you less times to save so you have to go through almost an entire level \( though short \) and complete it without saving once that is so stupid because if you die at the end you have to do the entire level over again that is the dumbest thing ever in a video game i just feel it 's unfair for the game makers to make a fairly difficult level then make you do it over and over if you slip and die toward the end stupid stupid stupid the levels can be a bit difficult if you 're not one to be quick on the trigger and as much i gripe on the camera angles they 're useful in stopping max at the end a hall swing the camera around and see if an enemy is around the corner waiting on the steps right inside the next room etc it gives you a heads up and makes it easier to stay alive however i still really liked it i did n't enjoy mp2 as much but mp3 \( which should end the series i think \) should \( re should \) be much better i'm looking forward to it	0
0	2 1 2 stars this is a very good concert teaming up a pre grammy santana with wayne shorter of weather report fame great rhythm section drums conga timbale top notch musicians first rate performance very entertaining my big problem comes with the quality of the dvd i do n't see the excellent picture others are raving about and when it comes to the audio options even if the back cover states dd 2 0 dd 5 1 and dts the menus are showing something else \( dd2 0 dts 2 0 and dts 5 1 \) but neither dts stream seem to be working only dd stereo works i own close to 200 dvd 's and all work fine dts and all bought it directly from amazon i had it replaced and the new one is the same this is not part of the great live at montreux series productions which are all great no matter how old the concert is so the 2 1 2 stars overall rating comes from 4 star performance combined with a 1 star dvd quality	0

0	this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it 's just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	0
0	i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one what happened ! ! this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game	0
1	this humidifier is easy to refil and not a big eye sore even in small rooms also stays very clean not a lot of build up like other humidifiers would give it 5 stars but you do have to refil it about every 8 hours which i guess it 's good that it 's easy to refil the price is also the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 i think it is a little pricey for not a lot of features compared to bigger ones with more features for the same price perhaps you pay for the convient size overall i really do like this humidifer and is the only one i like to have in the house because of low maintence and small size	0

1	okay so we all know the story about how the ducks come from behind to win and how coach bombay gets revenge on his old coach for many years of bad memories fair enough as corny and as thin as the plot can be at times it 's still a great story with good morals it 's definitely no hoosiers or rudy by a longshot but it 's disney at it 's best it 's a classic disney sports movie as well as a great family film now the dvd let 's just say that i sure did n't buy this movie for the special features there 's a menu screen with a chapter search and that 's about it ohh one more thing whenever they re released the film for dvd i guess they must have inserted queen 's we are the champions and we will rock you into portions of the film and at the end credits one thing in particular that kinda bugged me is that fact that the original score by david newman is replaced by queen 's we are the champions right at the part where charlie scores the winning penalty shot it 's not that queen 's song would n't be fitting here i just felt that the original score added a lot of emotion within the film not a huge deal i just did n't remember that the last time i saw the movie on vhs ahh well i guess for 8 i really ca n't complain	0

0	this product is a waste of time ! do n't bother the handheld game is entertaining for my daughter but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least ! once connected we walked around the virtual world with nothing to do it is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone there are much better products out there for children that are similar but easier to play with i would suggest webkinz or neopets these 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play unlike the muichiz site ! good luck	0

0	this home theater package despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality is ultimately very disappointing i'm new to hdtv and hdmi so i did n't know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision i have a sony bravia xbr3 oppo upconverting dvd player scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console this unit only offers pass through video so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input \( hdmi component etc \) for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection you 'll pay in extra cabling costs the hdmi on this unit carries video only no sound so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver and then from the receiver to your tv again major inconvenience and lots of additional connections the manual for this unit is beyond terrible i'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one for example there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not some are shielded and some are n't nothing in the manual about this there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself plus side is that there is no dvd player with this so i can use my own given a chance to do this again i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output	0
0	this switch works really well i use it between a windows xp and windows 98 operating systems when switching to windows 98 control to the mouse and keyboard is switched nearly instantly however when switching to the xp os control time varies from nearly instantly to 3 or 4 seconds i also like the fact that it controls both the mouse and keyboard with one usb port on the pc it frees up a port using the numlock key on the keyboard is the hot key to switch it also has buttons on the device itself to select which pc to control i rate this product 5 stars when i posted the first time i thought i put 5 stars but i must have accidentally selected 2 i recommend this switch to anyone who wants a good product at a low price	0

0	i was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment one would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the hebraic roots of judeo christianity it was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known messianic signs spoken of in the gospels he is also clueless to the pharisidical judaism of the time not comprehending that all of christ 's teachings were completely in keeping with true judaism all of which can be found in contemporary rabbinical teachings of his time this book which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels like it or not the new testament writings are hebraic and explain what fulfilled judaism is those who need to divorce judaism from christianity are offering a church which is already confused just more confusion it is through studying the hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our lord 'fullfillment of the law' binding and loosing \( the law \) etc as well as the parables the delivering of the deaf mute was a messianic sign because the rabbi 's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but he did not lazerus 's resurrection was a messianic sign because the rabbi 's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death cleansing of a leper was messainic sign because the rabbi 's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment that only god could lift how else can we link isa 53 with the 'stripes' he was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the law required for transgression and yet 'minus one' had our lord transgressed the law then the jews themselves could have legally killed him remember paul \( saul \) \? he also does not understand john and his huge part in the whole picture in that the kingdom 'began' with john he was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy this is hebraic roots 101 people please study the hebraic roots of christianity and do not waste your time with this book the fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti semetic should give you a clue	0

1	i bought this grill after reading reviews for many different grills i thought this one seemed to have the better reviews so i bought it i really love it it heats up pretty quickly and has enough space for 2 3 people 4 people would have to eat slower but it does have enough broiler space and its square to have people at all 4 sides we use it 2 time a month at least and makes a great fast meal the only thing that causes some distress is that the grill is not quite as easzy to clean as they say most of it comes off very easily but some spots of cooked grease remain it comes of with some elbow grease and a scrubby but it would be nice if it was as easy as they said it was	0
1	when i heard about this game at first i was stunned ddr and guitar hero are both games that focus on dance like and guitar like motions but they do not rely on the actual ability to dance or the actual ability to play guitar merely on combinations of responses through specialized controllers karaoke revolution however actually guages the accuracy of your singing your performance is based on how closely to the original song you sing your version measured by pitch of the voice i would have expected as in the tradition of ddr and guitar hero that karaoke revolution would be simplified singing hitting certain buttons on a controller to produce certain singing notes on the screen but no this game uses a real microphone and your real voice the game also uses popular karaoke songs that are universally singable it may not be entirely of my genre of music that i would sing at a karaoke bar but almost all of the songs i have heard of and can make a passable attempt at singing and there is a wide spread across genres and across eras so that most genres are represented and there is both older and very modern music i have only used this game by myself to sing and practice songs for actual karaoke but i can imagine this game being incredibly fun with a party as well it uses the actual versions of the songs and is essentially like competitive karaoke ! and beyond that it also has a straightforward karaoke feature that plays the karaoke versions of the songs complete with words for straight up karaoke for parties and such this game is one of several of this genre and i am personally looking forward to playing all of them my only critique is that there are limited numbers of songs and thus for me at least limited playing time if there was an on line version of this game that could access a much larger database of songs to play \( much like at a karaoke bar \) i would gladly pay a monthly fee to play such a game let 's hope such a thing is in the works	0

0	i am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set the finish of the rings are poor despite of previously poor reputaion i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter from the local ritz camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of tiffen filters i never got tiffens before had good experience with hoyas i will probably stay with those from now on now come to think of it ritz camera indicated the quantaray they had were made by hoya the glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the hoyas and the quantarays not a good sign the circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after 10 sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off quite frustrating all of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame but none of the other filters i got before had this kind of problem right out of the box the set might be cheap but it sure is for a good reason	0

0	we bought this for our 3 year old daughter for christmas we turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out we thought it was just a case of dead batteries so we replaced the batteries several times until we realized the product was just bad when trying to get it replaced we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead needless to say our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere ever we 'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music	0
0	i like some of the other walden farms products i gave their chocolate dip 4 stars but this one is not very good i tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it tried it in combination with the chocolate dip and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away the cellulose gel walden farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy sour bite to it it does n't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings but here it ruins the flavor	0
0	the first was one of the best thrillers ever with clever suspence good characters decent acting and awesome effects this one is meh why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight to video series \? what 's the bloody point \? now there are some good parts the rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent but you know that does n't even save it this movie is a annoying pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love it is so un intelligent it really makes you wanna puke the characters are nothing but cardboard cut outs i do n't even know them well all they do is scream run around in the cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut i also really hate the effects in this one as well they felt like they were over used there is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was the direction is ok but when it comes to adding wierdness it 's too much i do n't understand the story there 's a strange sex scene which a cube movie does not need cube is about suspence this one is just about adding too much effects a four dimensional cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one you do n't need that stuff if you wanted to make a sequel better than the first add something original do n't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original but no you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it 's a cube movie you do n't need nudity overall if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap go ahead i know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes if you 're a fan of cube dont' bother acting 3 10ugh do n't get me started these actors have bad acting skills and i hope they die gore factor 4 10cgi gore \? ! come on ! \? t a 1 10a cube movie does n't need nudity and they do n't know that because they do n't know cube direction 7 10andrzej sekula did have some visual eye in some parts i did enjoy a few scenes and i dug the rooms but you know i ca n't say he 's a great director he turned the franchise with straight to video written all over it bottom line if you wanna watch go ahead then you 'll be sorry this movie is just sad it does n't try anything to impress you because it 's idiotic lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again	0
1	after reading the previous reviews and noticed the bad comments about the instructions i took that into considerations and purchased it anyways nobody was really talkin bad about the board most of us have the urgency of putting it together w out reading the instructions and simply just looking at the drawings you have to approach this one differently i went ahead and borrowed a friend of mine and paid him with cold beverages because i defintely agree that you need at least 2 people to put this together the instructions although not as detailed did mention that you must read the entire instructions carefully to assemble this item failure to do so can delay your assembly because you have to disassemble and re assemble again finally it took us 4 1 2 hrs to complete the assembly and based on my experience it was n't that bad at all i only wish they added spare washers nuts just in case you lose it once its installed i added water to it and let me tell you its supposed to be portable but w the base filled its pretty heavy the board has a better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like the ones at the indoor gym 50 is adequate for a home use but you better have the apace for this the base takes alot of room the ability to move the height up down is as advertised i can do it with one hand very nice ! ! ! i measured it from the rim to the floor and its accurate based on the height you adjusted to one thing i found out just now this slam it rim you are not allowed to hang on it or it will cause you your warranty i know because lifetime answered my question i emailed out they do not have weight limits on these rims so do not attempt to hang on it i defenitely recommend this if your shopping for one	0
0	this movie while not a bomb or a turkey has a couple of serious flaws one is the casting ted wass has lots of credits to his name according to imdb but what a wimpy character less uninteresting washout he is ! was blake going for a harold lloyd lookalike \? he got one but there 's nothing else to recommend him he looks like a clark kent without the superman suit underneath the other flaw is the length even the opening credits \( using a defreiling patie ripoff style \) go on forever but the slapstick which is masterful as always \( blake having been raised on or at least heavily influenced by silent comedies especially those of laurel hardy \) my god does he stretch things out here ! the cameos are the saving grace especially roger moore 's his vocal impersonation of clousseau is perfect why did n't he dub the voice for clousseau in the concurrently filmed trail of the pink panther \? whoever did that voiceover sounded like sellers on helium ! it 's sad to see our icons age especially burt kwouk who looks and sounds awfully tired david niven looks as close to death as he actually was rich little 's uncredited overdubbing was beautifully done subtle and convincing herbert lom 's dreyfuss got bigger and more ridiculous in each successive film and harvey korman 's prof balls is delightful the entire scene in his shop is a stitch no there will never be another sellers \( and i have no intention of seeing the new film with steve martin \) but blake could have done better with his stopgaps	0

1	splinter cell is the first in a series of three amazing games \( to date \) it is available for the xbox ps2 game cube pc and game boy advance set in 2003 you play as sam fisher an elite operative gathering intelligence for third echelon a top secret initiative of the nsa \( national security administration \) you work alone during your missions with the support of a remote team who periodically feed you info and guidance throughout the missions if you are caught by the enemy your country will deny your existence and any connection to you like a sliver of glass small sharp and nearly invisible you are a splinter cell splinter cell is now highly renowned as being the ground breaking game that introduced the world to true stealth gaming light and shadows are the key elements in the game and play a vital role to your success unlike most action games where you quickly run around guns blazing in splinter cell you must be tactical in your approaches and slip by your enemies as if you were never there creeping around in the shadows is the best approach however sometimes you will be seen and have no choice but to eliminate any witnesses after doing so you should then elect to hide the bodies in the shadows as not to alert anyone of your presence causing a panic can easily create a real mess that will sound alarms and quickly end your mission in a bad way this play with light and dark is very well executed and amplifies the immersive qualities of the game even now years after its' initial release splinter cell is still worth picking up and playing in fact i originally purchased splinter cell for the game cube to take advantage of the exclusive connectivity features which enable the player to use sticky cams and have a tactical map displayed on their gba which is very neat by the way only after playing the two following splinter cell games \( pandora tomorrow and chaos theory \) on xbox did i then decide to buy the xbox version of the original splinter cell i played through all of the missions again this time including the exclusive downloadable maps from xbox live and found it to be even more enjoyable than the fist time around splinter cell is a truly classic and timeless game that should be in every gamer 's collection	0
0	i bought this dvd because it features alan rickman i also purchased it because of someone else 's amazon review \( they sounded like they really knew what they were talking about \) i am glad i bought it used because if it were new i would feel that i 'd been cheated the movie was about as suspenseful as waiting in the doctor 's office there was no sense of suspense and i was about as thrilled and chilled as a lukewarm cup of tea \( mind you i'm not the type who requires non stop action and special effects to be happy \) the dialogue throughout was tedious and trite the scriptwriter should be on the unemployment line as well as the director and the editor the plot was in some respects totally illogical and at other times nonsensical even previous scenes do n't tie in neatly enough at the end the plot is entirely unconvincing and implausible the choices the characters make whether restless bored frustrated do n't tie in the the normal patterns of logic and suck all realism away from the film \( like a greedy unwashed vampire \) the movie features a wealthy bored couple i was also bored but i'm not wealthy however ! all the actors did their best within the limitations of this film polly walker was very convincing as a sensitive but hypercritical wife in fact i 'd say she provided the best performance and her character was the most three dimensional and human they should have provided more time to make the audience more sympathetic to her character norman reedus was fairly genuine as the young man although he seemed more creepy and psychotic than attractive he failed to grab my empathy which makes the plot of the movie more implausible that a jaded wealthy couple would have allowed him into their environment alan rickman did his usual subtle work but it was so subtle that i thought they might have not let him have his morning coffee before filming his attempt at an american accent did not fly too well later in the movie however he becomes much more interesting the end lacked passion and was not surprising at all it was entirely predictable for rickmanistas yes you get to see alan naked so just fast forward to the end of the movie and you will be happy i have always admired alan rickman i'm a big fan but he would have been better in a more skillfully scripted directed film so i give it two stars yawn	0

0	i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little	0

0	i agree with all the other reviews saying the warmer with burn your hands and overheat the bottle especially when you only have a few oz in the bottle the water in the warmer actually boil when it heats up and if the bottle got stuck in the handle it means you have to use your bare hands to separate the boiled bottle and the boiled handle you end up having a boiled hand as well the worst part is it will burn your love one not only that the cooler does not close well so the content will not really be kept fresh even the ice pack is frozen before placing into the cooler we switched to avent warmer a little more but it is much better i would not recommend this product	0

1	after checking prices with all the usual pricing bots i found a better price including free shipping by going directly to amazon this lowest price did not appear in the other searches so it pays to go to amazon first i replaced my canon sd400 with the casio and find the controls more logical to use this is important if you do n't use the camera for a while because you can just pick it up and start shooting without hunting for the manual also the docking base is much more convenient than plugging small cables into the camera you do not have to remove the battery in the casio to charge it as you do with the canon sd400 the vga movie quality is superior on the casio still pictures appear to be about equal amazon delivered by ups in record time even with a weekend inbetween i ordered on a friday and received it the following tuesday go with amazon !	0

1	in truth there really has n't been a great mana game since secret of mana back in 1993 every mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings and children of mana is no different why did i buy it knowing this \? for the same reason many mana fans continue to invest in mana games there 's always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that secret of mana did unfortunately children of mana does not do this it does n't rekindle the magic secret of mana gave us but that should n't suggest it falls short of it either the world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages it is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you 'll set out to save the mana tree and the world itself children of mana by no means has a great storyline going for it at least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in gameplay no matter how you look at it children of mana is a dungeon crawler it is an rpg but it falls into the dungeon crawling category when you enter dungeons they 're just swarming with monsters and you 'll be surrounded before you know it so you 'll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss take him on and then you 're done rinse and repeat the process does at times become annoying but children of mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the gameplay to make up for it the first tidbit of interest is how combat works it 's actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things it 's surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours you 've got three hit combos you can perform on enemies you can knock enemies into other enemies there 's quite a bit of intersting things you can do however what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you ca n't ahead of yourself too fast first and foremost you ca n't equip and use everything you find right off the bat the game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations this keeps the game from being too simple you 'll also have access to magic of course each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you it 's interesting to play around with as well in dungeons you can also dual wield weapons although not in the way you 'd think when i say duel wield i specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time so you ca n't go about swinging both of them at the same time which probably would 've added more variety to the gameplay otherwise along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities it 's interesting but not really all that deep you 'll mostly find or purchase these gems another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many sidequests the game has to offer children of mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on and they 're actually pretty well worth it the problem with the gameplay however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast the objective in just about every dungeon is to find what 's called a gleam drop and then bring it back to the gleam well it 's annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way fight through a horde of enemies retrieve the gleam drop fight a boss and leave over time it becomes increasingly repetative however children of mana has a great remedy for that too it 's multiplayer up to four players can play at a time and the game is so much more fun that way you and your friends can make your way through dungeons together and sometimes it 's just a blast to do there are moments of slowdown when playing in multiplayer mode but it 's nothing to get too frustrated with because it does n't happen too often the multiplayer alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the gameplay as far as graphics go the game does n't look too bad the sprites look like they 're ripped straight ouf of sword of mana and the game is completely 2d however the mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit they 've been about its unique art style which in children of mana is absolutely gorgeous it 's artwork is just beautiful to look at each environment is given extremely good detail the only problem as i mentioned are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed musically children of mana sounds fantastic it 's one of the best sounding ds games out to date very few of the current games hold a candle up to it 's fantastic soundtrack the bottom line is simple children of mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline there 's just enough variety and interest in the gameplay to keep one going for the adventure even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with however keep in mind that children of mana really is just a dungeon crawl and it 's uncrealistic to expect an rpg that 's all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away on the whole if you 're looking for a game that 's fun you 'll find it with children of mana however if you 're looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters you wo n't find it in children of mana the good beatiful artwork fantastic soundtrack there 's a lot of variety to the gameplay multiplayer is a blasts tons of sidequests to dothe bad the storyline is n't good the gameplay has a lot of vareity but it 's hard to get past the fact that it 's repetativ	0

0	when i ordered this product it had a 4 star average rating how that happened is beyond me were a zero star rating available this product would n't even deserve the string of uncolored stars ! i purchased it thinking it would certainly do better than the plastic freebie grinder that came with some peppercorns about a year ago after many refills that all plastic grinder has finially started to wear out and peppercorns get stuck in the gears the grinder has started to squeak and spits out chunks of pepper so i order this one it 's attractive low mid priced and offers a warranty against wearing out and guess what \? i'm still using the plastic worn out grinder ! this miu grinder was a total waste of money and i just ca n't bear to listen to it squeal when i attempt to use it its adjustement is loose enough that 's not the problem what good 's a lifetime warranty against wearing out if i'm not going to use the grinder at all \? now i'm stuck with it unless i want to pay to ship it back and lose free shipping discount on the original order so basically i may could get a few bucks back which is probably what i 'll do because this grinder is n't worth 2 cents ! i would n't even give the thing away maybe pepper grinders are one of those things you just need to feel and buy in person i 'll certainly not purchase another one online if you like the sound of fingernails scratching a chalkboard buy this grinder buy a second one for your salt while you 're at it you 'll love 'em ! \( update 1 month later i tried to give this thing a chance and the god awful squealing is becoming less consistent which might be even worse as it now takes me by surprise as it lets out a high pitched jag every so often it 's gotten quite worse however with spitting out various sized chunks of peppercorn from fine grind to quarter corn sized pieces in a few turns not recommended at all i might try switching it over to salt maybe it can handle that better	0

0	this car pictured could be a base or first version defintely not worth 299 00 these are going for 100 00 and less on the web if you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me lots of people dont notice heres the differences below on these 5 cars there is two versions of each driver \( 5 different drivers \) that were made first versions or base version and second versions or added features version the first versions have no added features stickers and you cannot race any two \( or more \) cars of the 5 different drivers' cars at the same time ! dale sr and dale jr jeff gordon jimmie johnson and tony stewart cars of the first versions \( no added features \) cannot race together ! transmitter frequencys cannot be changed speed and steering are straight function \( no varilable anything \) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight speed is either it goes full on or it doesnt same for reverse gear again each of the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other updated or added features versions have added features stickers those added features are digital proportional steering \( variable steering \) which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot variable speed control this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off ! this also works for reverse gears as wellnow if this isnt cool enough each added features car has different frequencies for different drivers' car the transmitters for the cars are different as well added features version transmitter has two trim adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the frequency chip on the side of the remote than can be changed and can also be changed on the chassis of the car so if you own 2 of the tony stewart cars you would have to have a frequency pack to race them at the same time now two or more different drivers' cars can race together \( or five people can race 5 different cars \) no two alike cars can race together unless you have the frequency of another car and transmitter to change it or a frequency pack from team up inc all 5 frequency chips do not come with the car in the box off the shelf this frequency pack is sold seperately ! you can also purchase tires suspension parts and body hold down clips fully painted and ready to use new spare or other drivers' teams bodies extra rechargeable battery packs seperately ! i have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask nascarnbroncosfans msn co	0

1	when digital cameras first came out i like many people swore i 'd always be loyal to film digital could never take the place of film i'm not convinced that it has replaced film completely there 's still something i love about putting a roll of film in the camera shooting away sending the film to be processed and seeing the results i also know it 's a bit expensive i know that the argument about quality has always been paramount in the discussion but digital cameras are improving in this regard and most manufacturers are assuring users that while the technology will always be improving we are at a point where a good investment can be made in a digital slr and it will not be outdated as soon as the buyer purchases the camera so i figured now is the time to get a digital slr i have been a loyal nikon user for nearly ten years and have owned the nikon n60 n70 and n80 my first love was and still is the n70 \( i 've been told by the person who sold me the camera he thought i was the only person who loved the n70 \) i purchased the n80 only after my n70 cost too much to repair but i 've enjoyed the way my various nikon cameras have handled all sorts of situations and the fact that they can be as simple to use as a point and shoot if i do n't have the time to use specific controls but it also has options for more creative and artistic purposes my nikon cameras have allowed me to capture family moments with ease and majestic landscapes wildlife shots and all sorts of other things i ca n't resist to capture forever i decided to purchase the d70 since it was close to what i 've already experienced with nikon in many ways it works in a similar way to the n70 and 80 except it 's a digital rather than film version like the film versions of the midrange nikon slr 's it has a dial that allows an automatic setting portrait landscape sports close up nightscape and night portrait modes the ability to select aperture shutter speed or manual controls the camera has auto and manual focus abilities photos can be as easy or technical as the photographer desires the controls are easy to use though it takes practice to be comfortable on a personal level the camera has passed the halloween test niece 's birthday test and fall foliage in new england test and favorite scenic spots test the only real difficulty i 've had with the camera is trying to capture stained glass windows in a dark setting auto focus has not worked at all and i'm not thrilled with the manual focus of these shots but at this point i'm sure it 's the photographer and not the camera i do have one suggestion for anyone who purchases this camera the manual is very confusing it uses all sorts of symbols and can be more of a distraction than anything else i 've had luck with the magic lantern guides with my other cameras but have not as of yet used it for this camera i did purchase the nikon d70 field guide \( david busch wiley publishing \) which has been helpful it can be a quick reference for anyone already familiar with nikon and photography in general but it also provides and introduction for the novice to photography	0

0	john coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine wynton and the lcjo are in effect the death of creative musicians like coltrane or most of the truly creative jazz scene for that matter wynton is establishing himself as the face of jazz a market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music by telling us \( and make no mistake these guys do \) this is what jazz is and trying to re appropriate themselves the music of jazz giants such as john coltrane who if he were alive would not be given the time of day by these folks wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music the recording since i must talk about it features a set of crafty yet discomboluted arrangements merely mimicking what coltrane was mostly empty of content setting in motions soloists who sound more like jazz puppets than anything remotely close to what coltrane was striving for \( notable exception ted nash ! \) you do not need this record wynton and the lcjo does not need your money spend it on musicians who put their life and their art on the edge the way coltrane did	0

0	there are certainly some memorable scenes in this film but as a whole it just did n't quite work for me vlastimil brodsky is indeed a talented and endearing actor but spends the whole film playing the same stock character fanda a maddening yet adorable grandpa oh so young at heart oh so mischievious and impish but somehow oh so good hearted and harmless that you ca n't help loving him warts and all in fact that 's one of the fatal flaws of this movie the lack of any dark side to any of the characters they 're all basically harmless walt disney types even the bumbling and self absorbed son there are no real consequences to brodsky 's actions other than stella \( his wife \) finally talking divorce but it 's obvious almost as soon as the words are out of her mouth that she 'll come back to him there is no center no force or dynamic power in this film it 's like a limp wine that you tolerate because you do n't want to hurt the feelings of your host the ending also relies on another lazy device the virtual deux ex machina in the person of stella suddenly transforming into a spirited accomplice supporter of fanda 's when she sees that his attempt at self reform is only making him miserable this film might 've been much more effective and poignant had it spent more time dealing with fanda 's desperate fear and avoidance of dealing with old age and death instead of focusing on how clever audacious and adorable of an elderly madcap he is which makes much of the film reek not only of kitsch but even worse narcissism one wonders if the director was just so awestruck at the chance to work with mr brodsky who is a towering figure among czech actors that he decided to turn the film into a bit of a hagiography of him a more accurate title for this movie especially given the ludicrous ending shot as the credits roll might be the fantasy life of a poor old man	0
1	the bowflex is one of the most amazing machines i have ever used with its range of exercises and a little creativity on your part you can do just about any exercise you want to do i completely recommend this if you do n't have the time to go to the gym or if you just really enjoy working out at home one disclaimer do n't think you can get the same results you can get from free weights if you are an avid free weight lifter you can get your kicks out of maxing the leg press and perhaps even maxing the bench the powerrods have a tension that is proportional to the amount of bend you give them thus if you do an exercise with 100 pounds of resistance but only move the power rods through their first half of bend you are n't getting 100 pounds of resistance also when you extend the arms of the pulleys to do the wide grip bench you decrease the amount of bend in the rods to the point where even if you bend them all the way you are n't getting full resistance do n't get me wrong i love this thing i 've had mine for the past 2 years and it is amazing i work out twice a day for about 45 minutes to an hour each session only because i do n't have the time to make it to the gym get this if you are very serious about workout out at home and do n't have a lot of space to fit other equipment make sure you have a positive attitude going into the lifting programs experiment with ideas on different exercise movements more than anything this piece of equipment is a blast to use have fun with it	0
1	this is one honker of a tire pressure gauge good long reach for my f350 dually tires from the rubber handle dual foot valve via a flexible hose to a meter with a big display after one day 's use i do n't see why the display does n't always engage but poking it onto the valve stem gets it going ok instructions not obvious that you must remove the red strip that protects the batteries also not obvious how to get to the batteries whatever they are but i 'll figure it out i may try another reviewer 's idea to bend it 5 degrees for easier access thru the access holes to the valve gotta use it a bit longer first sure is a good gauge in any case	0
0	i 've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and i 've loved getting this but it has undergone changes recently and not for the better specifically i hate what they 've done to the graphical design inside whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about now they 've adopted a uniform style where nearly everything looks the same it looked better before the writing is n't as witty or sharp \( have longtime staff departed \? \) and there are filler pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes useless attempts at humor that simply do n't work the strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics especially the movie and dvd section sadly typically when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos i do n't let my mailbox fill with crap like this	0

1	after 2 nights of no sleep because our 18 months old son figured out how to flip himself out of the pack n play \( with just sheer upper body strength ! \) i was so relieved to find this crib tent and it was a pain to put together \( it took about 20 minutes \) but well worth it because it works he has stayed in the pack n play and didn't seem to care at all that he was trapped i think kids do like the playfulness of a tent my 4 year old was jealous ! there are a few downsides its a pain to set up and break down and if your using the pack n play for over nights and travel it isn't as portable as could be and i have an older pack n play its from '02 when we had our first baby so the ends are higher than the sides so the clips have no where to clip onto but it hasn't mattered the side clips have been enough to keep our strong toddler in place overall the product is expensive and a pain to set up but priceless because it lets the whole family sleep soundly and safely !	0

0	now if we 're being completely honest and true to the stats this album is killing the charts but maybe just because people are lowering their standards besides the fact that i dont like this girl because she is just too rough around the edges this cd is no dangerously in love where beyonce 's sultry vocals and powerhouse notes highlight her entire album cole 's raspy voice and sometime y pitch concern me aside from the obvious car banger i just want it to be over and the wildly popular love \( which cole butchers when singing live by the way \) nothing here surprises me like i said you can call me a hater but with women like beyonce and fantasia around cole 's fire will probably be put out soon	0

0	there are bad movies and then there are bad movies universal soldier the return is a cosmically bad movie a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to manos the hands of fate for comparison the first universal soldier film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars jean claude van damme and rocky refugee dolph lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do people perished in violent ways stuff exploded and van damme and lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film even the presence of the charming ally walker as van damme 's female sidekick greatly helped the film the movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition dvd some time back it unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel the second and one hopes final installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that i sat in open mouthed awe watching it i think i can safely say i am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll van damme returns as luc the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film on this outing he now works for dr dylan cotner \( xander berkeley \) a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer s e t h luc with his female sidekick maggie \( kiana tom \) helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers the film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse pounding jaunt up a river a jaunt filled with explosions stunts gunfire and the briefest glimpse of tom 's incredibly fit form as the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things kiana tom is incredibly hot but ca n't act her way out of a paper bag luc has a daughter named hillary \( karis paige bryant \) who you just know will get into trouble at some point and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are romeo \( bill goldberg \) and the one played by michael jai white frankly turning off the film immediately after glimpsing tom 's amazing physique is probably a good thing everything that follows is dull predictable and so full of plot holes as to defy description universal soldier the return feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film sure enough cotner 's computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers in the resulting conflagration s e t h implants its consciousness in michael jai white luc and his loved ones flee from the compound and the military swoops in to contain the problem an extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called erin who is interested in exposing the government 's latest shenanigans predictably van damme and schanz team up to track down er well track down something to defeat the supercomputer i think they need some code to shut the system down but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse luc can hand out even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult 's only club ca n't make this turkey fly it 's dull folks and painfully so by the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between luc and s e t h back at the shattered compound with an injured hillary 's life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed luc \( geez what a surprise there ! \) i knew i just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck how bad can it be you ask \? read on plot holes in this film are innumerable as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager 's face for example luc explains to erin that he was once a universal soldier just like romeo but cotner cured him by restoring him to life he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers what the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications \? he brought someone back from the dead ! how exactly did he accomplish this feat \? we do n't find out from van damme who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications i could go on but let 's discuss the performances instead or the lack thereof i should say i adore kiana tom she 's a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth 's rotation but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth another problem is the lumbering bill goldberg whose funny lines are anything but and the more i think about heidi schanz the less i think of her you have to wonder about a film where jean claude van damme is the best thespian in the cast you might think a movie this foolhardy should n't contain any bonus features on dvd you would be wrong trailers for this film the return double team desert heat knock off maximum risk and nowhere to run showcase the dubious career of jean claude van damme a making of feature a van damme career retrospective \( ha ! \) a michael jai white feature and talent bios round out the disc my advice to those viewers thinking of renting universal soldier the return \?

1	toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable but there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste my fave song is 'is it for me' it is hard to classify them though it sort of deep and meaningful \( at most times \) pop rock other good tracks include walk on the ocean pray your gods and i will not take etc i regard this album and 'dulcinea' as their two best albums	0
0	i thought my fresh vine ripe tomatoes would come whole instead as you can see from the graphic i received five whole tomatoes and one that had already been cut in half yes half a tomato the half tomato in my package had dripped on the other ones and made quite a mess in fact the resulting tomato juice ate a hole through the box they arrived in making a puddle on the floor that was small but big enough to trip the ups guy he fell and fractured his spine and now he 's paralyzed his wife and nine children are destitute all thanks to these vine ripened tomatoes in conclusion i think this packaging is just a bad idea	0

1	i got this car seat for my 10 month old daughter i was concerned that it would be too large for my car \( i have a honda civic \) but it fit just fine rear facing you would need to put in the center of the back seat so if you have 2 kids you would have to put the seats up further but if you are short that will likely not be an issue i had it installed at the fire station and it fit in perfectly he installed it in minutes and did not need any foam pieces to make it fit properly ! it was a perfect fit on its own pros 1 it is the best car seat you can get ! 2 has side impact protection also makes a good headrest when baby falls asleep3 the adjust knob for the harness is awesome to adjust especially over large coats4 the seat is very well cushioned soft fabric5 fits fine a small car even rear facing \( i have a civic \) 6 it 's heavy so its not going anywhere ! 7 works for up to 65 pounds so we will get a lot of use out of the seat8 she loves it ! cons 1 it is large heavy \( though it is staying in my car so heavy is not a problem \) 2 the strap to tighted the harness is a little tough to pull tight on a smaller child but you need to pull straight out and not up3 it is expensivei highly recommend this seat \( we have the onyx fabric \) it is large heavy and expensive but it is the best ! ! i had buyer 's remorse for a few minutes but i figured it is the best seat on the market right now and 300 is a small price to pay for protecting my daughter i did a lot of research before buying and felt confident in my decision and in the seat ! very pleased with this seat ! also please make sure you get your seat installed by a certified technician \( check with your local children 's hospital \) improperly installed car seats and improper use of car seats is the leading cause of death among children and infants something very easy to prevent	0
1	imagine making a beehive cake or a honey citrus iced tea when looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors you will be cutting out a lot of recipes ! in fact i'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing there are 16 pages of recipes in a card format the favorite meal section and cooking for one or two is always of interest it shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included there is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough the men who run the range section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country these are ideas and recipes from real cooks across america one time i looked in the does anyone have \? section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items after sending her a small box she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers it is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe there is an address where you can mail the item i recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers this magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country you could also be a field editor and share your recipes cooking tips and other ideas with the home office staff you could literally end up in this magazine ! some of the delicious recipes i 've been clipping from this magazine include grilled sirloin steakcrispy fried chickenherbed seafood skewerschicken with rosemaryvegetable cheese tortellinigrilled turkey burgersbeehive cakehoney citrus iced teatonight i made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved i think this magazine inspires me to cook more and i have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore now i'm dreaming about the pear crisp with lemon sauce and the raspberry cheesecake pie therebeccareview com	0
1	i originally ordered a tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks \( amazon of course took it back with no problems \) i was so glad when the omron scale arrived it costs less than the tanita but the quality is much higher the numbers on it are very large and easy to read also it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the tanita i ca n't wait to try all the features by the way i weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied 2 lbs as promised great deal for the money ! ! !	0
0	this is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice i thought ooh what a nifty idea a head bumper ! the whole idea was great but if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine then the head bumper guard is a waste i actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers do n't ask me how he did this the good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib	0
1	i 've used the sd yd250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear overall the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor saving convenience i 've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough it can also save a lot of money provided you purchase the yeast in bulk \( for example 2lb \) the single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough this takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza and when the dough is refrigerated for later use it tastes even better in my opinion like most engineered products of our age this one is full of cute features that add little value or cause annoyance the yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best if you use it you \( for the most part \) create extra work for yourself because you 'll have to clean it later the dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use they make a marginal difference in baking results i only use the quick bake mode which takes 2 hours to complete let 's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings \( easy to do given the many parameters you can set \) you just push the reset or cancel button and start over right \? nope no such button exists then unplug the unit and plug it back in right \? nope the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages so the unit remembers where it left off yes but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes and after 10 minutes it will forget right \? nope i tried this too the unit does indeed forget eventually but it 's more than 11 minutes if you plug it back too early the timer resets and you have to wait again to summarize the hardware is excellent and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber	0
1	i received this set at a baby shower back in 2005 it has held up really well my only advice with a retail price of 232 00 and even an amazon price of 152 it 's still too steep i never had the quilt in the crib because it is dangerous to do so with a baby and he was constantly napping so i hardly ever made the bed next time around i'm going to find a pattern i like and just buy all of the decorative things associated with it then buy an inexpensive and plain bumper and sheet the room itself is what you and everyone else sees the bedding is almost impossible to see unless you 're hovering over the crib i do especially love the lamp switchplate mobile and 5 pc wall hanging from this collection you could buy all the accessories to truly create a safari room for less than the cost of the bedding alone	0
0	undoubtedly the worst 'best of' dvd ever made even if someone gives this dvd as a gift you should punch that person in the face after watching this dvd i felt like burning down the company that made this dvd if you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this dvd to him as a gift there might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror but it ca n't be for the actual dvd there are n't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds shame on the band for putting this out obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'best of' on dvd this item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture my taped videos on vhs from mtv and vh1 sound and look better than these ones really this essay in amatuerism may have some interest for worse is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90 's to 2000 'love is blindness' 'walk on' 'elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out did n't they have another filmed version of 'gone' \? mexico city 1997 was just a below average performance shame on u2 for keep going with 'gone' from that bad shaped bono 's rough night i still don t understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song i m talking about 'until the end of the world' in case you don t know there s an actual video clip from that song rather they just put the well known sidney 1993 version here rumors say they 're going to release a dvd boxset by late this year i really do n't want 'remastered' versions of shows we 've been watching for even 22 years rather i'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage just in case here 's a list of several unreleased pro shot filmed concerts from early 80 's to pop mart tour \( i did n't include elevation because there 're 2 dvd 's out there from the same tour \) cheers1 belfast 23 01 1981 \( awesome concert ! \) 2 berlin 04 11 1981 \( great goncert \) 3 new york 22 11 1981 \( good concert \) 4 hattem 14 05 1982 \( awesome concert ! \) 5 roskilde 02 07 1982 \( awesome concert ! \) 6 devore 03 05 1983 \( great concert \) 7 st goarshausen 20 08 1983 \( awesome concert ! \) 8 dortmund 21 11 1984 \( awesome concert ! \) 9 montreal 27 03 1985 \( great concert \) 10 los angeles 18 11 1987 \( awesome concert ! \) 11 dublin 31 12 1989 \( awesome concert ! \) 12 stockholm 11 06 1992 \( awesome concert ! \) 13 washington 16 08 1992 \( great concert \) 14 anaheim 14 11 1992 \( awesome concert ! \) 15 dublin 28 08 1993 \( awesome concert ! \) 16 adelaide 16 11 1993 \( great concert \) 17 rotterdam 18 07 1997 \( awesome concert ! \) 18 sao baulo 31 01 1998 \( great concert \) 19 santiago 11 02 1998 \( awesome concert ! \) what the hell are u2 waiting for \?	0

1	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was once he was walking he did n't use it again	0
1	this is by far the best tea you will ever find if you like a bold in your face but not overwhelming taste of cinnamon oranges instead of just flavored water like other teas you must be very careful handling the tea bags from the essential oils they use i love to smell tea so i placed the tea bag to my nose and took a whiff then cried for the next 30 minutes as my nose was on fire ! ! no amount of water or soap could remove the burning from the oils that were displaced on my nose also do n't directly touch it or reach into the bag with acrylic nails i ruined a fresh french manicure and learned the hard way the essential oils leave a green film on your nails that takes days to wear off other than that just try it once and you will be hooked like all the others ! my boss introduced this to me after she came back with it from a trip to seatle i 've been ordering it ever since along with all my other co workers who became a addicted it will brighten any day ! ! ! ! ! !	0

1	look what i found \? where \? under there ! under wear \? right there ! it says be the first person to write a review for jockey boxer briefs hmmmm no wonder no one has reviewed these yet who writes a review for men 's underwear \? ok fine i 'll do it i love these my preferred brand and style your brand and your style may vary as this category of apparel tends to be a personal preference item i only buy these in black as i am a firm believer that underwear \( men 's especially \) should not be white as by the time the end of the day rolls around and it 's time to change them it 's better to be left wondering what might be there as opposed to seeing it so prominently displayed on a white background ! these hold up well for the price nothing lasts forever the elastic band is usually the first to go \( after many repeated washings \) before the material gives out i e they will fall off before they rot off finally so i can feel like i have done a complete job in reviewing these i had a buddy of mine help with the ultimate test the weggie test and these shorts handled it well extreme pain was reached well before the structure and or material of the boxer short failed i give these a ten tippy toes rating for how well they performed in the test	0

1	i agree that this magazine boasts designer clothing with extremely high prices that most people cannot afford but may people be aware that this magazine is called teen vogue and obviously will follow in it 's big sister 's footsteps vogue does not feature clothes from walmart and so teen vogue will not either this magazine does not necessarily cater to only rich people who says that a person should only buy a magazine when she is going to get the exact clothes featured in it \? i am definitely no millionaire i'm 16 years old and still in high school but i enjoy this magazine immensely of course i dont slip out to marc jacobs when i'm done reading and get myself the shirt on page 79 but i do look at the styles so i can understand the new trends and just inspire myself some magazines dont always have to be realistic fashion is about pursuing beauty and covetting beauty and if all magazines only featured affordable clothes' from walmart and old navy well i really wouldnt know what that would be like teen vogue is a pure fashion magazine it isnt an all round magazine for young girls it 's only fashion and it does a great job at what it strives for the fashion is great and the taste is great the shoots are amazing a former reviewer reccomended seventeen and i want to note that seventeen is a different type of magazine entirely seventeen is extremely mainstream bubblegum and is not very fashion orientated personally i do not like that magazine but i'm not going to condemn it here teen vogue is classy stylish and lives up to it 's name you dont have to be a rich kid to read this magazine but it 's the only teen magazine out there which is dedicated souly to high fashion and yes features the best fashion people who are not interested in fashion will probably hate this magazine and that is probably why it has recieved so much criticism i on the other hand love this magazine the only reason i didnt give it five stars is because the reviews above deemed the stuff in it affordable for young girls and that does strike me as ridiculous otherwise look to this magazine for some fantastic fashion inspiration	0
0	at first i thought this product was great and i used it for a few days then i noticed that my face was getting red and swollen now i look all deformed i am really upset ! ! the acid ate away at my face and i am still waiting for my face to heal i called neutrogena and they said it is probably an allergic reaction march 23 2007 update after the swelling on my face went down my whole body started itching and i had to go see two different doctors the internist said that it got into my system and gave me two strong prescriptions to get it out of my system i took the medication for over 2 weeks and used cortizone 10 several times a day to relieve the itching my arms and legs are all scared there are still marks now even though my arms and legs have healed this was the worst product that i have ever used and i do n't even have sensitive skin i never had a problem with a product ever ! ! i was very careful when i used rapid clear it never got in my eyes nose or mouth i used it once a day for a week until my face swelled up and turned all red i looked like the character on mask horrifying ! ! ! i will never ever buy another dangerous product from neutrogena again ! ! ! ! i will tell everyone what happened to me ! ! ! the funny thing is one person that i told this to who also saw my swollen face she said this exact thing happened to her with another neutrogena product so i know it 's not just me ! what the heck is neutrogena putting in their products \?	0
1	amazon notes that these socks are only made from the finest yarns they mean it too ! these socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber and they are very well made and last forever i especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear oh sure these socks may cost a bit more but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves the socks also fit any shoe size between 7 and 12 therefore it is almost one size fits all a big plus ! i also like that the toe area is literally made from gold colored fibers great ! i would not dry these socks at high temperatures this could result in the sock becoming too loose on your foot eventually they will bunch up when you wear them and that 's very uncomfortable dry these fine socks at a lower temperature overall you ca n't go wrong buying these socks they keep your feet extra warm during colder weather they are manufactured so well that you definitely get your money 's worth a good deal ! smile	1
1	i love this little coffee maker i have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but i have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum this maker is made from stainless steel which is more expensive but for me it 's worth it \( as it will probably last a lifetime \) it makes a very good cup of coffee and i'm very happy with it also the customer service at the company that ships it out is excellent	1

1	and while yes i 've made comments in the past about how oprah has changed a little this is about a publication i'm sure that the person who wrote that this is just another magazine full of things one ca n't afford reads fashion or celebrity magazines full of many things she ca n't afford advertising generates money and while i do n't like ads either they are everywhere because advertising works if you do n't want to see them do n't buy magazines watch tv or go anywhere as far as the layouts being too full of clutter everyone has their own style there are some people who like that look and do n't prefer a pared down zen look magazines are not about reality if they were they would n't be plastered with plastic bronzed 6' females who weigh 100 lbs i'm originally from middle america and nobody looks like that there just take magazines and ads for what they are save your money like i do for things you just have to have if you do n't have the perserverence to do that then stick to the target and walmart circulars the knock offs are never far behind	1
1	as always the latest compilation in this annual science fiction anthology remains one of the great anthologies as the current entries are top rate for the most part the thirty contributions are superb tales from a who 's who of the genre especially fascinating is paul mcauley 's creative entry the two dicks in which philip k dick writes mainstream fiction until he meets richard nixon other stories are well written as gardner dozier scores again with selections that run the gamut from alternative realties to artificial intelligence to animal intelligence that worms its way into the reader 's mind the introduction by mr dozier provides a summation of the trends in the year which can be summarized as stable science fiction fans who appreciate shorts will devour this must reading that once again lives up to its title harriet klausner	1
0	the literature describes this unit as a flat mount ski rack compatible with any factory installed roof rack with crossbars hardly my vehicle is a 2006 gmc envoy with a factory roof rack this rack is the same one used on many gm suvs so great numbers of them are out there these racks have crossbars with a reverse wing shape that are tilted forward presumably to reduce wind noise the thule universal mounting system will not conform to these crossbars and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward \( or backward \) at a silly angle it can be used in this conformation but it looks odd also the ski rack indeed locks over the skis boards but the mounts are not lock protected so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches my searches found no alternative to this rack however and it does work for the intended purpose	1

0	let me get myself straigh here first i have always been a fan of the artemis fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins i loved the first one and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies instead of saving them from some kind of evil foe also the fairies were pretty cool and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism they were high tech and armed with laser guns unfortunately the author put artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz now let me rewiew this particular book its a horrible read who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts \? no me now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd i mean seriously a barbie doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they 're boys how old is the author anyways \? two years old \? well obviously he 's not married thats for sure i always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds not four year olds anyways enough of that the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father i read colfer because he writes futuristic books that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who does n't even solve robberies instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war all of the wicked humor is lost there is no action whatsoever the main charecter is n't a genius with wicked humor and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others heavily downgraded adn obviously the worst parts do not even read this thing get some other artemis fowl books or read alex rider thats a very good read	1
1	i just bought my first laptop computer and really really hated the touchpad i found it unresponsive at times and found the whole right clicking and using the pad at the same time a pain i spent a while browsing the different mice available on this and other sites and in the end decided upon this little number i am very happy that i did too its pretty small and very lightweight but at the same time it doesnt feel at all fragile definately well made im about 5'11 and have fairly big hands i find this mouse comfortable to use it looks pretty cool too the red panels on the side light up which is always good for night work all the buttons are very responsive and that middle button is a godsend after using the touchpad for the past month i couldnt ask for better all round performance and for 20 you really cant go wrong it really is a great price for a microsoft mouse the only reason i dont give it five stars \? \? well this is technology although it is a awesome piece of kit there are always other things or features they could have added	1

1	i read about lila downs' new cd la cantina in victor cruz lugo 's article entitled sweet sorrow published in the june july 2006 issue of hispanic magazine \( page 76 \) it is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on lila downs' new cd la cantina 1 the cd cover is awesome a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating lila in a pensive and contemplative mid air pause with her guitarra ready to rock it strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time awakening the historically oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song 2 each track is a lively composition of mexican corridos and sones impregnated with lila 's lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano chicano hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family 3 i first was introduced to lila downs and her musical talent when i enrolled in writer juan felipe herrera 's legendary manikrudo summer arts class at cal state fresno in 2000 juan felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down to earth talented voice later that night we all saw her in concert at the tower theatre in fresno and i 've been a fan of her work ever since 4 this new cd is indeed a delightful experience i appreciate that she moved into the corrido son etc genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more it has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious it 's authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity i think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of lila 's work she is a true artist i 've always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two cds however this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience 5 i am very impressed with lila 's voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000 there seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon ahua ! her solos in yo ya me voy have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity as victor cruz lugo writes through it all downs' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same this is my favorite of lila 's repertoire it is my opinion that those who purchase this cd will not be disappointed enjoy !	1

1	i typically do n't write reviews but being a gamer and seeing the negativity here i felt compelled to post my thoughts red steel is truly a fun game it definitely has its flaws but being an owner of 7 launch games i can extend that statement to every one i think it provides a truly unique experience and once you get a knack for the controls it becomes intuitive and nothing like you 've ever experienced before the ability to replicated sword movements and gun movements has kept me on the game for 2 days straight my personal opinion is that if you do not like this game you simply do not like what the wii can do if this is your type of genre it 's a must buy	1
1	what else can be said about this great cd \? it 's one of the best pop records ever made and you never get sick of hearing these 10 songs child of vision is the best \( the piano solo is killer \) of the best but this is one of those rare cd 's that you just pop in and let the entire thing play till the end \( no skipping over songs you do n't like \) a true classic	1

0	bought mine sometime around christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to st thomas last week it died within 10 minutes of being in the water it was never more than 5' down while i was snorkeling while i never tested the compass or thermometer against known accurate ones it seemed to work well enough for my purposes just keep it dry	1

1	i love this movie maybe it 's because it seemed so risque as a kid or maybe it 's because jane hates it whatever it 's great fun sure the script leaves much to be desired and yea the special effects suck it was 1968 what do you want \? but that only adds to its charm it 's a funny movie more on the silly side this is true camp and if you like campy flicks this one has to be in your collection	1
0	i would give it negative stars but that was n't an option this thing is horrible does n't cut very close certainly does n't hold a charge engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes and oh yeah the horrible razor burn ! ! ! seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams	1
1	this was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the marian cult the one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre christian origins of the marian cult other resources however cover the evolution of the anatolian fertility cult of cybele into the roman magna mater and later into the so called quot bvm quot the author does a good job of showing the origins of various aspects of mariology and contrasting these developments with christianity in the west the author has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the syncretic process which blended christianity with various pagan religions and medeival political structures to create the roman catholic church	1
1	i needed a replacement receiver for a fairly modest home theater system i wanted a bare bones 5 1 system \( no 6 1 7 1 1kw audio power satellite radio capable etc \) i only use the receiver as an audio switch and let the tv handle video source selection reviewers of the sherwood rd 6500 liked the audio but thought the set up a little confusing being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me the price was certainly right about the cheapest thing around \( at \) i bought the unit and have been completely satisfied i would have given it five stars but heck nobody 's perfect i had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality \( full disclosure my ears are 79 years old \) the unit has one optical digital one coax digital and several a v inputs the remote lets you pick video 1 3 cd tuner and aux inputs you tell the system which audio source to use for each of these one time and it remembers i liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present i was surprised to find how many premium hd movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in hd either i also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them on the negative side i like other reviewers bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub woofer is required	1
0	i bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my rebel xt amazingly i find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit i find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance \( 8 10 feet \) to be under exposed unless i correct the exposure using the menu would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430ex are better but i cannot recommend this one	1
1	this item was fairly easy to assemble would be easier with 2 people but i put it together in less than 30 minutes it was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip on the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours the carrier held up well i had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault it was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and i forgot to use the covers for those holes overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to florida	1
1	about two weeks ago i got a very small metal splinter embedded in one of my fingers when i picked up an old office magnifying glass that had a corroded metal trim piece i used my conventional tweezers and managed to break off a piece leaving an even smaller piece that i could hardly see still in my finger my conventional tweezers could only push it further into my flesh so i quit trying to get it out it was n't doing any harm surrounded by upper skin layers so i looked for the best tweezers i could find and ordered these i got them a few days ago at work and within a few minutes i had that teeny tiny splinter out of my finger these are great	1
0	my husband and i were so excited to receive this as a gift when our daughter was born he has been using it up to now and i used it this week for the first time our daughter is 9 1 2 months and 21 pounds it was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone the problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain i have after just a two mile walk ! ! ! i ca n't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk ! ! ! i would never recommend that someone buys this !	1

0	the program works fine on windows xp and is easy to use it lets you print cards of many sizes the big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program the back of the box claims quot 4500 cards and sentiments celebrate life 's special moments with cards for all occasions quot that 's nice the problem with that is that i counted the total number of cards that come with the program it only adds up to 1045 ! so where are the other 3450 cards and sentiments \? are you supposed to design them yourself \? i just do n't know and certainly quot cards for all occasions quot means just that does n't it \? well there 's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind i guess you just need to buy those on your own	1
0	i own both the original unbreakable autolock \( with the flat key \) and the autolock pro \( with the round key \) the original autolock never failed to open after 10 years of use on two cars the autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use this is not a key problem because i could not open it with two original keys i eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it i recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device	1
0	steven seagal keeps making films in 2005 alone he made as many as four films which itself sounds an amazing feat not so amazing however if you see `today you die' dreadful film with a dreadful title the press material i managed to get at japanese theater in osaka \( yes they dared to release it theatrically in japan \) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days small wonder that none of the film makes sense gives less actions than awful dialogues steven seagal plays one harlan banks ex master thief who is retiring from his job banks turns a professional driver of cash delivery van in las vegas but because of the robbery committed by someone else he is arrested and sent to a jail is he framed \? of course he is but when he can wear his trademark long jacket in jail and meets and enlists a help from someone named ice kool there \( played by treach \) there is nothing to worry about but i had to worry about because nothing makes sense in the film we see a glimpse of one orphanage \( briefly twice \) but no one in the film seems to remember it the film begins with a cheesy nightmare sequence that the girlfriend of harlan sees \( played by mari morrow \) in her dream that portends death and danger but this supernatural idea is just dropped in the second half of the film there is a detective played by sarah buxton whose motive to get close to banks remains unclear and nick mancuso adds confusion to the already chaotic scenario as agent saunders dull dull dull the most impressive part of `today you die' is one car chase scene in las vegas with decent stunts and some nice camerawork in fact these scenes are recycled footages from one sidney j furie actioner `top of the world' starring peter weller and dennis hopper \( yes i checked it yesterday \) the rest of `today you die' consists mainly of terribly witless dialogues exchanged between seagal 's character and others which goes like bodyguard who are you \? ! seagal `girl scout of america 'naturally poor bodyguard is beaten up by seagal clad in ridiculously long jacket who does it with the minimum energy helped by lightening speed editing and body doubles which strongly suggest he is not willing to do the actions once he had shown in the films like `above the law 'the film is strictly for the avid fans of seagal but i am afraid the number of them is getting smaller every year i like his films in the 80s and 90s and i admit `today you die' is not as bad as `the foreigner ' but that is n't saying much	1

1	although it does n't mention it these hepa replacement filters also fit the hamilton beach air cleaner model 04150 i had to email hamilton beach to find out but they were very helpful and responded right away when the filters arrived from amazon i saw that on the box it says fits models 04160 04161 04150 with our cat and houseful of antiques we always seem to have dust bunnies floating around i run this model in our office under the table which holds the computer since placing it there i have noticed the buildup of dust around the modem is almost entirely eliminated i placed the larger model in our living room and it certainly is doing its job the regular settings can be louder than expected but i leave them on the whisper quiet setting when we 're in that room and i do n't even notice them being on i would definitley recommend the hamilton beach air cleaners	1

0	to say this film is self indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement almost every joke in this movie that did n't center around profanity or flatulence was a nod to one of smiths other movies maybe if you are a great filmmaker you can get away with that but if you have only made 4 other films \( very poor ones too by cinematic standards \) then that just means you have the worlds biggest ego the film looks as if it was written by a highschool kid although the humor really dose n't reach even that level here is a recap of the types of humor in this film making fun of fans fart jokes scatological jokes profanity \( yes this is actually supposed to be funny in and of itself \) making fun of miramax making fun of the viewers for actually being stupid enough to pay to see this film \( i swear i am not making this up \) and any number of inside jokes involving the cast and crew this movie comes across as crass tasteless profane and generally an abject debacle in all respects thank god i borrowed this movie and did n't pay anything to rent it i wo n't be watching another kevin smith movie anytime soon	1

1	my 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy it is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well they love to pretend to be rock stars ! my only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control so you only get one level loud i would recommend it for any child that likes to sing	1
1	i'm not a huge coffee fan most of the time i find it bitter then there 's the whole language you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints but occasionally i do feel like i need that little surge of energy this kona blend coffee is the perfect choice it has a lot of flavor but none of the bitterness i find in a lot of other coffees this is the one i put in the coffee maker when i plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis it makes great iced coffee too	1
1	i recommend this movie as a most usually high star the torch song trilogy has done something that no other movie producer has dared to do \( i will leave it to you to identify what that is \) the torch song trilogy has blended wisdom and humor in a comical theatrical version of the life of drag queen who is more than what she appears to be on stage it identifies with what most homosexuals yearn for and the strength it takes to get it this movie is inspirational comical sad and dramatic there is no other movie of its kind and no other movie compares the movie identifies that love can overcome all and that if there is one thing homosexuals want it is acceptance and if you can not do that then get out this is a must have the only five star movie i have ever watched	1

1	i lived in japan for many years really enjoyed using these noodles in soups stir fry korean style cooking etc if you are looking for pasta these may not exactly match your craving but are nonetheless really versatile ! my advice for those who do n't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them sprinkle liberally with salt rub through with clean hands then rinse in cold water this is how they prepare them in japan it removes any odor they are ready to use	1

1	i got this scanner and am initially pleased with the capabilities of it as a diagnostic tool there are however some things you need to be aware of some of the advanced monitoring functions do not work on all cars for example the vehicle identification data does not work for pre 2000 vehicles \( but then i did not need that function anyway \) i was able to pull the dtc 's from my car see what it meant \( i had one dtc that turned on the cel \) then i was able to read what the sensors were seeing at the time of failure as well as a great deal of engine data from the freeze frame data function the live sensor data function works partially for my car again this is a function that may not work on older cars the advertisement leads one to believe that this will work for all cars be aware of this it can print the results using the usb cable that comes with the unit the printing function can be enhanced by copying the displayed data into the clipboard and pasting it into an editor program \( like notepad \) i found this to be a better way to print the results the software on the cd is very basic not much help with the codes there is a lot more data available on the internet the tool is easy to use and easily connects to and from different cars some of the advanced diagnostic data that it will capture is not easily understood unless you get some detailed instructions from the car manufacturer there is a good wikipedia with the pid codes for those who want more information to go through \( look up obd ii pids \)	1

1	i purchased this program about 1 5 years ago i have been casually studying german through other programs for about 4 years the best basic words only is through unforgettable languages \( very basic but easy as heck to learn \) rosetta stone is the best for understanding gender verb usage and adapting to the german style of sentence structure i absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program it is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking the only negative is that the cd has to be used to run the program even with an accelerated cd rom the starting stopping of the cd is distracting if that feature were corrected it would be perfect	1

1	i made the decision to buy this camera based on the many very positive user reviews it replaces a six year old 2 1 megapixel camera i am not disappointed amazon 's price is very good for a 7 1 megapixel camera with a boatload of features it is also considerably lighter in weight than the older camera later i read reviews by experts who give it only mediocre scores for picture quality they criticize it for no image stabilization leading to blur \( especially at higher power zoom \) and noise at film speeds over 100 asa i set up a couple of situations in which both problems should have been very apparent then i enlarged smaller portions of the frames to print inexpensive 4 x 6 test photos had i printed the full frame the print would have been larger than an 8 x 10 i just do not see the problems the experts criticize the colors are rich and vibrant i really appreciate the wide range of controls the user can choose a from a number of modes fitted to various situations these result in a faster shutter speed or more depth of field or fill in flash etc it is not necessary to memorize the tiny icons on the selector dial an on screen prompt tells you what each mode does i also like the amount of control in the manual mode the user can choose the asa rating shutter speed apeture opening and electronic flash mode the manual tells how to set the camera for special situations like photographing documents when you take the picture the through the lens screen goes black for part of a second you know the picture has been taken unlike a camera with an optical finder the camera is very intuitive for first time use i also read most of the manual on line while waiting for delivery and handled the camera several times in a local discount store when i first installed the software i restarted the computer but it repeatedly would not recognize the camera i switched to another usb cord and it worked fine immediately then it also began to work with the original usb cord i had even checked for a loose connection who knows what that was about ! one little thing to keep in mind is this if the camera is set on continuous auto focus you can aim and shoot if it is set on one time auto focus you must press the shutter halfway down and wait for the green light before shooting if you want sharp pictures i do not know but expect the difference is battery life a 1 gb memory card can store 485 pictures at the 7 1 megapixel resolution	1

0	my son \( now 4 \) loves cars so when i saw this bed frame i thought this is it ! well looks can fool you i also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame so i was confident that this was a must buy but after using it for a while \( 1 year now \) i am very disappointed if i would buy another bed frame this one would not be in my shopping list what i and all my family do n't like about this frame 1 the front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room making people falter sometimes 2 since it is made of plastic it gets really cold and it really feels terrible i do n't know why it is damn cold all the time 3 i had to exchange the regular height box spring for a half height one because the regular height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling 4 so many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame i have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings 5 i think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed it is waste of space 6 my son was disappointed that the wheels do n't spin and i think he has a point since this bed frame costs so much my son now do n't even think it 's a cool thing well he stopped liking the bed only after a few days 7 the head part of the bed is also plastic and for some reason your head can go under that plastic because that head part comes over the mattress it is quite annoying and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame and you ca n't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame 8 again it is very very cold and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard this is a miserable bed and i feel bad that i bought this horrible bed for my loving son we are gonna sell it for 100 dollars \( we hope \) in the summer the only reason for giving 2 stars is because it is very solid	1
0	i have several other pieces in this collection which i absolutely love when i was able to find the salad server set at amazon com for a cheaper price i could n't wait to order it when it came i was more than disappointed the set looked like it had either been 100 years old and was all tarnished \( which it is not supposed to ever do \) or someone had bought it tried to clean it with a polish \( again something that is not supposed to be done \) and it wore away the finish i also bought the medium size bowl to go with the salad server set and when that came it was all scratched ! needless to say i returned both for a full refund immediately obviously the cheaper price meant cheaper quality in this case and it was n't dirt cheap to begin with i still had paid 75 00 for it compared to 150 00 that it is sold in stores for	1

1	this product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic amazingly it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer \( just a thin cardboard box with no padding \) the only real gripe i have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper the hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side this does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities one of the reasons why i picked this particular product in the first place if it were not for the flawed lid i would have given this product a five star rating	1

1	if you are about to switch to an xbox 360 buy this game first as your last xbox game you wo n't be disappointed this game has the best graphics i have ever seen on a console although it has great graphics the physics are the real selling point you can pick up virtually anything in the world and throw it around or stack it with the gravity gun \( zero point energy manipulator \) barrels float in the water like they should and explosions are suprisingly realistic the enemies and challenging and varied and dead bodies flop around like they should \( especially when you shoot them with the shotgun \) the voice acting is very well done and characters will turn to look at you if you move around the only drawback is choppy framerates at times highly recommended	1

1	this is absolutely tremendous ! if you ever owned the original kirby lee fantastic four comics and let them go for whatever reasons or if you never had them and want to see the world 's greatest comic magazine in the days when it truly lived up to that title this is the way to go ! no one who 's gotten this far should pass it up it 's an unbelievable bargain and a wonderful item in these days of madness like comics slabbed in plastic like han solo trapped in carbonite forget the marvel masterworks volumes the reproduction ranges from shoddy to terrible and the color is garish those reprints do a great disservice to these classic comics the originals looked much better than they do in the masterworks volumes ! an example fantastic four 5 in the masterworks volume on the very first page of the very first appearance of doctor doom black splotches inexplicably obliterate most of doom 's mask there 's no excuse for that ! that was n't there in the original and it 's not here in the scan ! if you do n't own the original comics and are n't wealthy enough to buy the originals this is the way to go the scans are very good high resolution here you see all the linework that gets clotted in the masterworks volumes and you can zoom in and really study all the details of that great kirby machinery otherworldly architecture and cosmic panoramas ! i 've had a big grin on my face from the moment i looked at the first page this is what comics are all about pure unadulterated cosmic fun ! the original letter pages and ads are a real treat too the whole experience is time travel ! oh yeah you also get 34 years of non kirby fantastic four issues \) please note ! if you have a mac and are having difficulties with this dvd here are some tips are you opening it with preview \? if you just click on the icon on the disk it will open in preview but this will not work properly you must use adobe reader to see the pages without the watermark install adobe reader from the dvd make an alias of adobe reader and put it in the dock click and open the dvd icon click and open the decade folder do n't open the year folder click and drag the pdf icon \( such as ff 1960 pdf \) onto the reader alias in the dock to open click on year click on month click on the magnifing glass icon to zoom to any size enjoy all that cool kirby machinery bigger than you 've ever seen it ! i hope this is helpful	1

1	three years ago disgaea hit the scene and was by far one of the best games to grace the playstation 2 now we have disgaea 2 disgaea 2 follows the if it ai n't broke do n't fix it path while disgaea 2 is really familiar to the first one that 's not a bad thing the first one was absolutely perfect disgaea 2 does connect with the first one so this really is a sequel it is n't however a sequel that requires knowledge of the events in the first game you may very well run into familiar characters but on the whole disgaea 2 is a whole new story adell is the only human in a town full of monsters and it 's all the overlord zenon 's fault he 's put a curse on the town to make them all lose their memories when adell 's mom decides to perform a ritual that will bring forth the overlord she instead brings forth zenon 's daughter rozalin so you 'll now have to venture off in search of the overlord the best thing about disgaea 2 's storyline is the same thing that worked well with the first one it has a perfect balance between it 's moments of seriousness and humor it 's a well crafted story that is n't afraid to break the rules the game really plays no different from the first one you 'll go into battle and be able to do a bunch of different things while it does play like your basic tactical rpg it throws in some things that make it more worthwhile like the geopanels on the ground that if a character stands on they get special enhancements you can also do things like have one character stand on another 's shoulders if you do n't like the effects though you can just destroy the power source it 's not as easy as it was in the first one however these power sources now get up and walk around the game is also rather complex battling is no walk in the park if you 're familiar with tactical strategy games then disgaea 2 will be easy to learn you 'll deploy ten of your characters on battle at a time they can perform team attacks or attack indivually you can use this to your advantage but your enemies also must be kept in mind they do n't slouch they 'll attack at the same time and can take your characters down pretty fast if you do n't know what you 're doing of course disgaea 2 also sports some rather bizarre moments in battle just like it 's prequel for one thing you can order a pizza in the middle of battle this is just one of many different things you can do items also level up and your characters levels will soar it wo n't take you that long to complete the main storyline but purists will find that disgaea 2 much like the first one is almost never ending in terms of complete mastery your characters levels will rise far into the hundreds and even thousands it 's almost never ending you can also replay story missions over and over and go into optional dungeons items also level up you can go into the item world and level up your items you can level up just about any item your weapons armor even that pizza you ordered ! these moments of the game also feel never ending at times disgaea 2 pretty much looks and feels like the first one it 's simply a beautiful game it 's got spectacular artwork it 's 2d artwork but it 's some of the most beautiful in the gaming world it also sounds really good keeping the theme of the first game in tact the voice acting is probably the best part they 're so lively and vibrant and the dialogue is crafty and filled to the brim with humor some of the humor mind you is probably not suitable for your little kid there some sexual and dirty jokes but they 're really funny disgaea 2 is just an all out blast the game for one thing is huge it may only take 40 hours or so to complete the main quest but to master the game \? that 'll take much longer than just about any tactical rpg out there there 's so much to be done and it 's by far one of the most addicting games out there so if you do like tactical strategy rpgs then by all means play this game you 'll love it if you loved the first disgaea you will love this game ! there 's no doubt about it the good loveable characters fantastic storyline addictive gameplay this game is huge beautiful artwork complex battle system vibrant and colorful voice acting among the best in gamingthe bad the only real bad thing about this game if you can even say it 's bad is that it does n't really go above and beyond the first disgaea in other words there 's not a whole lot of new content or anything like that however it 's still a bit more original than most other tactical rpgs out ther	1

0	i have been using turbo tax for years just as i jave used quicken for years one of the big plusses for me was it 's deductible a program that places values on items you give to charities and imports directly into turbo tax it 's deductible was a stand alone program until 2006 when it went to intuit for online entries you could not longer buy the program to install on your pc this would have been ok but then intuit would not allow you to see the values placed on donations until you purchased turbo tax intuit thinking of the bottom line rather than the customer i hated that and told intuit my feelings no response as i expected but what the heck i entered my donations through 2006 and when turbo tax 2006 came out i purchased it from amazon for a good price after installing turbo tax i went to see what my donation values were and to import the values into turbo tax from my online entries nope no can do not only was it 's deductible buried in turbo tax with a very clunky and slow link to start the program but there was absolutely no way to import after much searching on intuit 's support pages always a chore i finally found a page explaining no import but if you like you can get a voucher to unlock the online values and then manually re enter the information into turbo tax ! what a crock on top of that using it 's deductible and turbo tax slows my duo core pc to a crawl i will look elsewhere next year	1

1	i was very impressed with the texture of these shadows they slip on softly with a great feel and last all day or night with no creasing i also like the way the colors will go on subtley with a light touch or with a heavier hand build up for more intensity the color selection is gorgeous just one word of warning you ca n't really go by the color samples it 's better to see them in person i bought lilac mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what i was expecting but paris by night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve i was dissapointed until i tried it it contoured my eyes beautifully and while intense is very natural looking this is about the fourth time i 've bought laura mercier products and i 've been totally pleased with the quality	1

0	after reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone i purchased here are the main issues i have found with this phone 1 \) the buttons are too small particularly the main control button you have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time and believe me i do not have very large hands 2 \) if you have quite a few contacts in your phone you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact you will notice that if you are not careful you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly so if this is you be aware 3 \) you must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message very inconvenient ! ! there is no indication to show this on the top screen only the inside screen 4 \) on occasion the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely what you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again not optimal and i probably just got a bad phone but i am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent so i can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from motorola note i have no personal vendetta against motorola but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff i bought into before purchasing	1
1	i enjoyed francis veber 's 'the closet' released in france in 2001 for two reasons first it features an all star ensemble of french acting certainly a tribute to veber 's skill as a director just take a gander at the first six names to appear on the imdb credits daniel auteuil fran ois pignong rard depardieu f lix santinithierry lhermitte guillaumemich le laroque mlle bertrandmichel aumont belone the neighbourjean rochefort kopel the directorimagine a movie where the great jean rochefort gets slotted sixth each of these six stars can carry a movie in france on their own back the fact that the group has teamed here is a testament to veber 's reputation his previous release 1998 's 'the dinner game ' was lauded far and wide as a comedic masterpiece actors get attracted to that type of skill the second reason i got a kick out of watching 'the closet' i just learned that 'bend it like beckham' writing partners gurinder chadha and paul mayeda berges are prepping a uk re make for the screen for a targeted 2006 release with chadha at the helm her keen eye for comedy tinged with poignancy was confirmed by beckham 's runaway success so i feel like i'm in on a really great secret knowing she 's working on a re make	1

1	i'm one of those people who always looks up product reviews before buying anything so it was on a leap of faith that i bought natural health magazine without reading anything about it a friend suggested it and since this particular friend has never led me wrong before i caved in and bought the july august 2005 copy immediately let me start off by saying that i'm an extremely picky person i have extremely high standards for every purchase i make and i absolutely will not cut a manufacturer any slack if i find a fault now that i 've gotten that out of the way i will mention that i was thoroughly impressed with natural health long ago i subscribed to new age magazine \( now known as body soul which i do not care for \) it was among my favorites solely due to its wide variety of content and true to focus natural lifestyle tips and advice i cannot stand redundancy incorrect information and excessive advertising i found that natural health was much more long the lines of the former new age magazine filled with dozens of little gems that make it worth much more than the 3 95 i paid to give you an idea of what the magazine includes here is a small sampling of the articles i found in the july august issue small articles include to bee or not to bee a breakdown on aromatherapy ingredients that include bee pollen royal jelly propolis and honey stating just how effective and natural these ingredients are how can i get relief from pms \? experts \( including a naturopath gynecologist and dietitian \) answer this question with excellent responses medicine cabinet attack of the weekend warrior natural remedies and aids for those like myself who love to be weekend warriors clothes to pose in great yoga gear ! medical breakthroughs healing supplements 8 ways to beat anxiety fitness fix knee savers longer articles include healthy appetites savvy strategies for eating well delicious healthy recipes and tips good medicine a clean healthy mouth a well researched article on mercury fillings fluoride toothpaste and the best at home remedies five paths to peace five simple meditation techniques eat to beat the heat yin foods more great recipes ! sacred spaces making your home your personal retreat this is only a sampling in fact that 's less than half of the magazine alone some articles are fairly short but provide just the right amount of information to get the point across my personal favorite was the last page make one change where this month 's change is to upgrade your z 's it included simple tips that i was able to implement immediately the amount of advertising seemed slightly less than usual \( probably about the same amount as you 'd find in a yoga journal but not nearly as many as in oprah magazine \) and they seemed to be in line with the natural health focus judging by the past reviews on natural health it seems the magazine had a bad run in the 2003 2004 timeframe let 's remember that magazines change editors frequently i found none of the past complaints to be true in this issue but that may not be so in future issues years from now as for me i want a subscription asap	1
1	i purchased this lens for my canon eos 20d digital camera and so far i really like it it focuses fast and produces very sharp clear images as with any longer lens you do have to be careful about camera shake i 've had a few images come out blurry but these are usually interior shots i really like the 28 200mm focal length range and find the lens to be very versatile for framing wide shots of buildings or landscapes to zoomed in shots for portraits or close detail shots the lens feels solid and appears to be well constructed which is typical for canon products for the price range this is an excellent lens you can only do better by spending considerable more money on an is lens	1

1	deyoung begins by relating how bush pushed powell out at the end of his 1st term without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him making matters worse was the fact that bush did n't even know why powell was at the white house when it came time to say good bye colin powell came from jamaican parents \( often called jewmaicans by american negroes because of the emphasis they placed on hard work and education \) and during his early life in the nyc area suffered little if any racial prejudice later on unfortunately the insults were quite aggravating but powell was determined to not let them inhibit his performance powell was an indifferent student in high school and at ccny \( majored in geology \) however rotc piqued his sophomore year interest and he soon became a standout powell went on to be selected outstanding cadet and top graduate \( or very close \) in every military training setting he undertook as well as a top mba student at george washington university he also was top ranked by superiors in almost every military assignment leading to his being offered a white house fellowship which in turn provided powell with travel to russia and china and brought him in contact with a number of influential people who were impressed enough to forward powell onto chairman of the joint chiefs national security advisor and secretary of state one of powell 's secrets of success was to enthusiastically implement all orders even those he considered silly powell himself believed that doing otherwise grounded the careers of many talented others unfortunately powell eventually crossed paths with dick cheney \( a bit of a problem during gulf war i a serious problem when cheney became v p \) between cheney 's far right bias \( out on the looney fringe per powell \) and bush ii 's disturbingly disjointed decision making per treasury secretary o'neill \) powell 's contributions as secretary of state were severely limited and constantly undermined and countermanded often with don rumsfeld 's help in addition he was often left out of important decisions especially when out of the country ultimately powell 's credibility suffered from the inaccurate information provided in his u n speech attesting to saddam 's wmd the big question still debated is why did n't he resign \? his supporters believe the reason is that powell 's nature simply did n't allow anything less than 100 support bottom line if cheney had not been such an ideologue \( telling bush there were no candidates good enough to run as his v p ignoring powell and then sliding into the position himself \) powell would be v p today possibly president in 2008 similarly if bush 41 had not been so stubborn and instead replaced quayle with powell in '92 powell might well have become first v p and then president	1

0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	1

1	a word to the wise about sizeif this is your first time buying lush soap online be forewarned you will receive a piece that is about 1 thick and 4 5 long in other words you will be receiving a fairly small piece of soap if you have a lush store near you i strongly recommend that you go and smell the huge chunks of soap they have on display once you find a scent you like buy a lb brick of it it will cost a little over 20 but it is worth it if you find a soap you love i also find that it is easier to experience the full scent of a soap with a bigger slice i know that lush stores are few and far between \( the closest one to me is about 35 miles away not that far but too far to be convenient \) but if you can grab a couple of friends and make a road trip out of it it 's an adventure ! now on to rock star what a delightful soap if you are a fan of the mmmm melting marshmallows bath melt then you will also enjoy rock star the scent is the same it is also the same as snow fairy shower gel and the creamy candy bath melt i cannot quite place my finger on the scent the main ingredient in it is vanilla absolute but this smells much more sweet and girly there is a definite floral scent lurking under the vanilla but i am at a loss to try and describe it ! it sort of smells like warm cotton candy with a hint of brown sugar it 's the closest i can come to trying to describe the scent the scent of rock star will linger on your skin for the entire day it 's absolutely wonderful it also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh every time my husband uses the upstairs bathroom he has to come find me and ask what smells so good in our bathroom it is a fabulously creamy soap and it lathers quite well if you have white tile in your bathroom it will leave a pink lather pile on the tile but it is easy enough to wash off there are a couple of minor downsides to rock star but they are minor 1 it melts way too fast i just wished it lasted a bit longer 2 it can leave the skin feeling a bit too squeaky clean when i first started using rock star i thought it would give me dry skin but that has n't been the case it just feels a bit dry after showering despite these small issues rock star is the perfect soap to make you feel a bit girly and a bit sexy all at the same time	1

1	this was a gamble since it is n't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign i only tried muscle milk because i read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an nfl athelete during an espn interview i started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily two months later my strength has increased my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished my workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on mm but the results since using mm have made an impact there is nothing else i can attribute it to the fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of mm i would still use it if it tastes like battery acid do not fool yourself it is loaded with fat it relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it 's true benefit you will not get sculpted by using mm without commitment you will only get fatter but if you are committed and use mm as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance	1

1	i live in one of the red states in the deep south therefore unfortunately quality yoga instruction and teaching is very hard to find but fortunately yoga journal is delivered to my area providing most of the yogic wisdom and learning that i have received through the years however i agree with other readers i do n't care for the ads for cars and cellulite cream \( who needs cellulite cream btw when you have a regular yoga practice \? \) i also do not care for the models they use is this publication most of them look like adolescent girls who have just come from the senior prom ! there are a few exceptions here when they do a feature on shiva rea ana forrest or one of the iyengar family members but for the most part this gives a misconception that yoga is just for young skinny women what a shame having said that there is alot of good material here you just have to get past the aforementioned there is some very good advice on fitness nutrition and health athletic injuries from hatha yoga and other forms of exercise there is also many articles on yogic philosophy and spirituality and living our yoga by bringing it into everyday life all in all a decent publication especially if quality yoga studios and instructors are scarce in your area	1

1	first off as many people have said the game is wonderful as a movie less so as a game itself i am not a habitual player of rpgs for the sake of their gameplay however i stray toward puzzle solving and instant action games along the lines of the ecco the dolphin and metroid series respectively but i appreciate the intricate storytelling the genre allows for xenosaga really goes overboard for the sake of its story and there 's nothing wrong with that the game is pretentious and open about being pretentious the cast of characters are all to a greater or lesser degree mentally ill from heroes to villains and back again the story takes a sudden and whiplash inducing turn in the last third of the game the morality of decisions made are distinctly nietzschean which is to say often amoral and confused but the critical but ! it 's a wonderful story often because of these facts if you 'd like a good story to chew over and talk with your friends about \( i'm still talking about it three years after i was introduced to it ! \) buy this game if you want instant action and a transparent storyline eh give it a try it ca n't hurt anything but understand when you 're going into it that this is more of a movie than it is a game the objective is to entertain enlighten and even disturb through the visual medium not necessarily through the gameplay itself oh and there 's plenty of eyecandy for both the ladies and the gentlemen always a bonus 8	1

1	i picked up a dozen in home depot for less than 5 same concept just a lot cheaper ! two of them are holding a huge heavy shelf in my kitchen the hole they make depends upon the weight of what they 're holding i'm sure it 's pinhole sized if you 're hanging something that weighs a few ounces \( in which case you do n't need this use a pushpin ! \) the holes from the shelf are bigger than pin sized but it is a heavy shelf the hole is still way smaller than the hole i 'd make using any kind of a hook that would hold such a heavy shelf it also takes a little practice to figure out where to hang the hooks \( the drop of the hook is below where you might want the thing to actually hang \) this is a small detail but if you need two of these things and you do n't do it right your object is gonna be crooked but on the bright side you wo n't have a huge hole to patch when you redo it ! recommended product \( but look around for the knockoffs	1
1	had i read these reviews before buying this i probably would n't have purchased it but i had been looking at the much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked i did n't ask if there was a certain model that he recommended so i assumed i 'd have to pay from 40 150 for a sonicare when i saw this one for 30 at target i figured i did n't have much to lose i 've had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist could n't get it turns off automatically after 2 minutes so i know that i'm brushing my teeth longer one thing that takes getting used to is not removing it while it 's going you 'll splatter toothpaste all over yourself ! d another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush ! ! the only negative is that it goes thru 2 aa batteries about once a month but the directions said that it lasts about 60 brushes per battery change and that 's about right i 've started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems	1

1	never say never again is a fantastic action thriller directed by irvin kershner it is the remake of thunderball however it is still an enjoyable action packed adventure movie sean connery plays his role brilliantly despite his age \( 53 \) this is vintage sean connery an older wiser and audacious man he has not lost his touch with ladies kim gives a good performance as the bad guy 's pal barbara carrera performs her role as the sexy clever and wicked fatima blush very well klaus maria brandauer is also a remarkable villain while irvin kershner 's direction is commendable rowan atkinson makes an interesting and amusing appearance among some of my unforgettable scenes are the opening war game teaser the battle with lippe at shrublands and a great motorcycle chase despite his age connery is surprisingly very fast agile and very witty the plot is sound and interesting a spectre agent under the command of ernst blofeld infiltrates a us air force base located in the united kingdom and steals two tomahawk cruise missiles james bond must find them before they are detonated the characterization is superb and i liked the ending	1
0	as part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that i have missed over the past few years i came across this clunker i understand of course that i am not the target demographic here most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity unfortunately i was looking for an actual cinematic experience four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named dr von doom \( who wins the award for the most obvious name for a villain ever \) they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers \( now we 're talking \) thanks to some chemical filled cloud what follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show we get the thing caving in the front of a semi truck with his shoulder as the money shot but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified an entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers but since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered and succeed destruction for the fans no consequences for the characters but why would director tim story try anyways \? he knows the people are just showing up to ogle at jessica alba as she pretends to act so instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame he should have just directed a pepsi commercial with jessica alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess the plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble they are n't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie they go out show off their powers \( in things like extreme sports you know for the kids \) and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough there is also a lackluster love triangle between sue storm \( jessica alba \) reed richards \( ioan gruffudd \) and dr von doom \( julian mcmahon \) i'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like jessica alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful all wealthy dr von doom but chances are if you 're chasing someone that looks like her she 's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career so why is my rating so high above the zero i 've been talking it up to be \? well it is what it is it did n't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly it was fun watching tv actors such as michael chiklis and julian mcmahon try their luck at a hollywood blockbuster and at least it was n't catwoman but what it was was insulting beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe jessica alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid story thinks we are at a newsstand on the cover of people magazine there is a picture of sue storm now if stephen hawkings ca n't make it to the cover of people then what chance does this two bit scientist have \? 1 4	1

0	i purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed we have the full sized papasan swing and the travel ocean wonders swings at home \( which in retrospect we were wishing we brought with us \) while neither of those are 100 perfect they are much better than this one the open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame stop the swing from moving and potentially get their feet legs stuck in between the bars also the swing seat almost lays horizontal \( with the foot part of the swing much higher than the head position \) while swinging to the point that i am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor lastly the mobile is horrible it 's pitiful and i find it hard to believe that fisher price put something like that on the market it 's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings the strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches these toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds it 's a very poor design and needs a lot of work and my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not it does n't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have that said the swing is very attractive and appealing i only wish it were better made and more thought out	1
1	to be honest i ca n't think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound i 've heard for me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one my favourite songs on the album are the only moment we were alone and six days at the bottom of the ocean every time my ears are blessed with these artworks i'm am fixated on nothing else but them i literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything i just have to listen to them intently this album is not as experimental as those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever but i feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be i love the pure clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind the trance that this album provides is indescribable i'm not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note either way i strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced written recorded thought out and sounding buy it you will not regret your choice one bit	1

0	with a good script and a director better suited to the material \( i 've read pedro almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and jonathan demme was originally attached to direct \) asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star natasha richardson unfortunately the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist 's wife \( an excellent natasha richardson \) and one of the asylum 's patients \( an equally good marton csokas \) under the watchful eye of the patient 's doctor \( ian mckellen \) there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie some of which seem quite preposterous at least in the way the movie was shot the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson she does her best in spite of the choppy script and she even won a best actress award in london for this film however as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual repression and obsession director david mackenzie has done an extremely sloppy job \( in fact i remember that in the promotional interviews richardson credited as an executive producer sounded very disappointed about the way the movie turned out	1
0	the charger unit or the batteries \( or both \) do n't work right i use the batteries one at a time in rotation to power my zen mp3 player sometimes i put discharged batteries in the charger plug it in the light blinks red then goes off only supposed to show either red \( discharged charging \) or green \( fully charged \) this morning 3 batteries show fully charged i take one out it is discharged all these problems happened with a first unit i returned it to monster and after they took their sweet time got a replacement which works just as erratically monster 's stuff looks good but it is the last time i am going to buy their brand	1
1	good product like the price this is much less expensive than the current pinseeker 1500 models i bought it on ebay used for 150 so you may be able to find it for less \( look under hunting and golf rangefinders for this model \) this does not have the pinseeker feature of the newer models but normal mode and scan mode work perfectly for ranging flags that have no reflectors \( although you may need to try more than one time and have relatively stable hands \) i was able to range a flag at 270 yards and was able to range the top of a telephone pole at 375 yards \( but it was windy so the flag was straight out and a little cloudy \) i would estimate that this will work for ranging flags on a calm sunny day \( these do n't work as well on a sunny day because the laser used is a visible light laser and gets a little interference from sunlight \) at 215 230 yards for a flag \( which is what i need it for \) less expensive alternative than the pinseeker and i really like the performance very impressed	1

0	i bought 4 of these light sets after seeing them in real simple magazine i thought they looked and seemed to be a perfect option for my kitchen wrong ! after only 15 minutes my brand new batteries \( 4 aa \) seemed to fade and within an hour dead i thought this is a mistake and bought new batteries again only to be upset when the same thing happened ! i called the manufacture about getting the adapter 4 8v it requires only to be told they do not sell to the public and i would have to track it down at radio shack etc well i have had no luck on that yet lots of 4 5v but no 4 8v i wish i could send these back they were a complete waste and if i ever find the proper adapters i will certainly use them but that defeats the purpose of me choosing wireless lighting does n't it	1

1	i have to write a review for the below review \( the one i have in quotes \) the below reviewer states this is 170 watts and you need 1875 watts i nearly fell off my seat ! not only by the review but by how many people recommended it ! first 100 watts is average for a hair straighter 170 watts is excellent ! 1875 would melt your hair ! i did not think it was fair that this person rated the item without having knowledge on wattage this straightener only has 170 watts of heating power that is not a very good number ! if you want salon straight hair you need a ceramic straightener with 1875 watts especially if you have thick or very frizzy hair !	1
1	what can a single lie do \? that is the question that is examined in lillian hellman 's the children 's hour martha \( shirley maclaine \) and karen \( audrey hepburn \) run a small boarding school in a small new england town karen is engaged to a local doctor \( james garner \) when karen punishes a malicious student the little girl decides to get revenge the way the girl does this is repeat a out of context statement made by martha 's aunt \( miriam hopkins \) to complicate matters she blackmails another girl \( veronica cartwright \) into confirming the story this lie immediately destroys the martha and karen 's school but their life 's are destroyed soon thereafter when their slander suit is rejected but when the lie exposed it is too little too late when the play opened in the late 50 's it was daring and very controversial when the film opened in 1961 it was still controversial but 40 years later it is not the lesbian story line that is interesting but how little has changed hepburn gives her usual excellent performance and would have gotten an oscar nomination if she had n't made breakfast at tiffany 's that year shirley maclaine was fresh off her success in the apartment and was ready to stretch her dramatic legs she proved that she could handle drama just as well as comedy but it would be 15 years for her to get another great dramatic role \( the turning point \) fay bainter and miriam hopkins were major character actors in the 30 's and 40 's and were given one final chance to show what they had left bainter received an oscar nomination for this film william wyler had nothing to prove in the 60 's yet he continued to select great films with bite that featured women in strong roles this was another triumph for him dvd extras none	1

0	if you 're a teenage guitarist and want to learn nickelback green day and nu metal songs then this magazine is for you there 's also some pretty good tips for beginners from time to time but in the last several years the quality of the feature articles and interviews has gone steadily downhill and there are far too many ads as many people have said sometimes it does n't seem to be geared towards musicians at all anymore the smarmy hipper than thou rolling stone spin pitchfork media style of writing seems to be taking over the mag and other styles of music such as blues country jazz etc are pretty much ignored but like i said if you 're a teenager and you see it on the newsstand and there 's a song in it you would like to learn pick it up otherwise avoid this magazine	1

0	if this movie was ever going to have a chance it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long or never attempted in the first place some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay possession just ca n't be dealt with that way what you have as a result is another story entirely there just was n't time enough i guess to develop the characters or even to include half of them the only character true to the book and left almost intact was sir george the rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating and we are left with painful stereotypes and in the case of roland michell a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming my best advice is that if you 've read the book skip the movie but if you saw the movie you should do yourself a favor and get the book	2

1	david baldacci has a knack for writing fiction that sucks you in and holds you no matter what the story part of the talent is to introduce interesting characters this book is no exception sara evans is a clerk working for a supreme court justice she is quite close to another clerk \( michael fiske \) who works for a different judge michael asks sara to marry him but sara really loves michael 's brother john who sara has only seen once and never officially met michael comes across an appeal that intrigues him \( to say exactly why would be a spoiler and it is only revealed very late in the book as to exactly what intrigued him \) so much that he pulls it out before it is filed and goes to visit the requestor that happens to be a rufus harms who is serving a life sentence in an army prison for murdering a girl when michael goes to see harms practically all hell breaks loose and harms realizes he is in danger himself and some mysterious evil guys from the prison murder michael apparently there was some secrets in harms appeal that some powerful unknown men do not want known michael 's murder is investigated by his brother john \( an ex cop who is now a defense lawyer for the lowest of the low criminals \) and he enlists the aid of sara who was close to michael and knows some things about michael sara is instantly in love with john and the more they start investigating the more they put their lives at risk from the unknown powerful men additionally the police start to suspect john of the murder of his brother especially when he is named as the sole beneficiary of michael 's life insurance meanwhile rufus harms has escaped prison from some of those men that tried to kill him so we have tension throughout to see if rufus will survive as well as john and sara before the evil guys get them there is a lot of good information about what goes on behind the scenes at the supreme court a good rea	2

1	know you you were me looking for what seemed to be a simple thing a scented candle that actually smells up the room when you light it you 've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of well grocery store and some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room so then you hit the expensive pretty versions perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names they are not candles my friend they are sculptures some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers this is when you lose your patience i do not want crispy dried flowers i want a candle that pumps a good scent all over a room when i light it this is it votivo you will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle the most universally loved scent is probably red currant i also enjoy rain the little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done plus they make perfect last minute hostess gifts as the box is very nice and expensive looking so votivo is n't the cheapest candle in the world they 're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink weakly stink	2

1	a quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running i 've been able to do most of the things i 've wanted to do with this program and it 's delivered on most of its promises my wife loves it too i have to remind myself that i'm not an architect and this is n't a professional program though it does most things really well but it has some short comings i'm trying to draw my house right not which is a 4 level and have n't had any luck yet although i 've net seen all tutorials i'm doubtful the program can do it at all foundations have been difficult to manipulate at best my planned home addition includes a home theater and i 've had to use work arounds to get risers and sound insulated walls \( which messes up my already difficult to use cost estimator \) but it has let me put in chairs speakers and a projector screen which makes the 3d views very close to what the finished product may look like the framing view is a dud as it appears to serve no practicle purpose so as long as you have realistic expectations from the program it should make you very happy basic functions are easy to learn and my wife and i 've had a blast planning our addition i ca n't imagine designing our addition remodel without it i would buy it again	2

1	scrubs has been a model of consistency in its five seasons and to interrupt myself why are n't we anticipating season five instead of season four \? and boo ! on them for being so slow to bring the show out on dvd ! and season four is no exception i recently rewatched seasons 1 through 3 on dvd with my daughter and it really brought home just how great this series has been from the very beginning to the present if you visit boards there are always prognosticators who declare that it is n't as good as it used to be but i would be dishonest if i said that i detected any decline one thing i 've really enjoyed is that unlike situation comedies this one really does have an overall story arc and i really appreciate bill lawrence and co taking the time to reward fans of the show in this way the story in season four revolves largely around the very very gradual repair of the friendship between jd and elliott fans of the show know that at the end of season three jd utterly smitten by elliott had expressed his love for her causing her to break off her relationship with her boyfriend to be with jd no sooner had he done this however he once again felt trapped and almost immediately broke things off with her season four opens with her filled with hatred of him complicated by the fact that she and he are named co chief residents \( though there is wonderful confusion over the fact that the name plate on her door reads thanks to janitor chief resident and his misleadingly reads co chief resident causing many to imagine that she is over him \) some of my favorite visuals in the series are of jd and elliott wedged into their ultra tiny office barely large enough for the desk they face each other across of course eventually they patch things up but for the first season have no kind of romantic entanglement given the intensity of the events of the ends of season three any sort of getting together would certainly have ended with elliott murdering jd the season ends with carla and turk urging jd to move out and get a place of his own which leads to an interesting roommate situation in season five season four continued the scrubs tradition of having some very high profile guest stars this was marred somewhat by having the absolutely dreadful colin farrell on one episode an episode through which he drifted as if completely drunk or totally bored \( there have been very few bad episodes of scrubs but this episode ranks near the bottom \) the always delightful heather graham sparkled through several episodes earlier in the season matthew perry stopped by for an episode less interesting for his presence than for his being teamed with his father jonathan bennett perry a country singer best known to most people as the old spice sailor tara reid puts in another appearance as jd 's terrible sometimes girlfriend while molly shannon is in another episode and julianna margulies of er appears in a couple of episodes the great tragedy with scrubs is that it remains something of a secret the only comedy better than scrubs in the past few years has been arrested development \( most fans of one show tend to be a fan of the other as well and the lead of each show appeared on the other zach braff as the producer of the girls with low self esteem series of videos on ar and jason bateman as a patient on scrubs \) and while it won a large number of awards its ratings were worse than scrubs this show has decent ratings but shockingly few awards how terrible shows like everybody loves raymond and the formerly good but now dull will and grace beat it out for awards is mystifying and how did it manage only one emmy nomination \? it was nominated for best comedy series but why was n't zach braff nominated for best comic actor and john c mcginley and donald faison for best supporting actor in a comedy series and sarah chalke for best supporting actress in a comedy series \? how is that possible \? much ink has been spilt on how the 2006 emmy nominations have made less sense than any in memory \( lauren graham yet again not nominated though clearly the best comic actress on tv for at least five years and five vastly less talented women were nominated instead of her lost not nominated no nominations for veronica mars jason lee not nominated for my name is earl neither michael chiklis hugh laurie nor james gandolofini nominated for best actor while martin sheen who was barely appeared in this year 's west wing while shows way way way way past their prime like will and grace and the west wing nominated and the list goes on \) but zach braff 's failure to be nominated while charlie sheen and kevin james did is just one more reason not to take the emmys seriously at all at least the golden globes more or else get it right anyway awards aside and armed with the knowledge that the best shows are usually neglected by the emmys \( how many emmy nods did buffy get despite most of the nation 's best tv critics passionately begging each year for it to get the recognition it deserved \) fans of the show will be delighted with season four and if you are n't a fan you should be but do n't start with season four go back and do it right either buy or rent \( i recommend buying you 'll want to watch this more than once \) season one then work your way forward many pleasurable hours will result	2

0	i'm a gamer i play for hours a day and currently use a simple ms intellimouse optical well i was looking for something a little more pro and in my searching i saw the razer line of gaming mice i uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with it 's got large rubber triming down each side so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons i only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will never ever be able to reach them during game play it also feels too long and flat so the scroll wheel is note easily reached and your hand does not rest comfortably yeah it looks great and i'm sure it 's doing an amazing job a moving precisely however i ca n't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape so for gaming it 's rather worthless	2

1	i have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat this led to me shopping in health food stores whole foods for anything in the cracker cookie snack category i once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3 4 supermarkets and could n't find any so i went to whole foods near my job i saw these crackers and bought the cheddar flavor and loved them i have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors who does n't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies \?	2

1	somehow this movie touched my heart and my mind and i am sure if ben and matt could figure out exactly what their formula was they would do it everytime however it just may be one ofthose once in a lifetime things like first love impossibleto re capture and in a sense haunting i am not obsessive inany way but i have watched this movie at least twenty times with each time revealing another layer of meaning and with the movie becoming a place where i sometimes go for comfort the synergistic combination of outstanding actors in their best roles maybe their best ever in combination with simply agreat story most definitely puts this movie in a specialcategory so buy it and watch it you 'll be glad you did mik	2

1	i like this for more than one reason so read on reason 1 it keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data trust me this helps when you are transferring 1 gb of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone reason 2 only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car you will have to use windows media player to sync this phone \( samsung sync sgh a707 \) in order to transfer files mp3 and wmv wma formats work with this phone i do not know whether other formats work or not let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the usb end to your computer usb port \( preferably usb 2 0 \) if you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open my computer on your computer now open windows media player you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu from left to right you will be able to see in this order now playing library rip burn sync and guide click on sync make sure your cell phone is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes \( your cell phone name apears on the top \) usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file this takes a while also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select samsung media card as the samsung phone option has very limited memory once you are well versed with what your phone can play i would recommed copying files to your microsd using a usb reader writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer this saves you a chunk of time and battery power	2

0	yes t c is the oldest continually published magazine in the usa and it 's their 160th anniversary however i see little reason to celebrate why \? because i fail to see how it 's really improved over the years nowadays this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the nouveau riche back in the day when it was a true high society magazine there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts literature and culture it was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about bling bling so has this magazine there are far too many adverts for so called luxury goods for my tastes and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new power base they insist on using only thin 20 something models who probably ca n't afford the clothes they are modeling ! articles wise they are starting to sound more like glamour or cosmo than the erudite publication i used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago yes t c has changed with the times but these are not good times if that is the case it 's too bad	2

0	if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman 's self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student	2

1	most sneakers these days come in two varieties they 're huge athletic clod hoppers for teenieboppers or they 're white keds or orthotic shoes for old ladies this sneaker is the best compromise on the market today it 's youthful without being for the young light weight low profile wide enough for a thick sock and it 'll get you compliments everywhere you go my first pair is in black and wow they are stylish today i wore them out shopping and my back started hurting before my feet did my one objection is this supposedly 'squishy' foot bed i do n't know if my shoes were missing that part or what but i found the sole to be hard and inflexible they were still comfortable but it was n't like putting your feet on pillows or anything if you do prefer a squishier footbed i recommend a thin insert so as not to squish your toes i'm not sure if they would perform well for athletics i'm going to be saving mine for errands and casual nights out but i want these in every color	2
1	the music here frequently reminded me of pagan 's mind with a touch of porcupine tree and flashes of iron maiden a fantastic mixture of 1970s progressive rock bands such as yes and kansas molded with european style power metal and brazilian folk music while this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that do n't quite mesh in actuality i give the cd 4 5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired sometimes flawed ambition but as an overall package this special edition of temple of shadows is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus dvd holds a concert in 5 1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog this is a great album filled with high quality progressive power metal and a dvd concert that gives a taste of their other albums \( not to mention it 's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves smiling throughout the show \) highly recommended	2
1	i recently viewed this film when it was broadcast on television and i must say that it was one of the best movies i 've seen in a while part of the spy genre quiller travels to berlin to investigate the resurgence of a group of nazis and it is necessary for him to uncover where their base is located as with any spy thriller it is difficult at times to differentiate between a supposed friend and and an enemy one keeps wondering if quiller is indeed placing his trust on the right people particularly those who claim to be on his side quiller is a spy who does n't carry a gun noting that he is less likely to be killed if he is not armed despite his intelligence and wit he still gets caught in precarious situations impeccable acting accompanied by astute dialogue make this a compelling piece to watch over and over again	2
1	i am not a big magazine reader never have been never really had time to ! however a friend of mine at work kept bringing me copies of this magazine to read after falling in love every time read it i finally i had to get a subscription of my own ! this magazine covers everything ! it 's got tips for life cooking decorating organzing and getting the best deal for your money a lot of the stuff in here shortcut cooking ideas for instance are stuff that i use and apply to my normal life for example the july 2006 issue has a dessert shortcut for peach cobbler the result of that recipe was a wonderful dessert for my family of four that took me less than 15 minutes to prepare and tasted great ! they do n't endorse products nearly to the same degree that most magazines do and when they do it 's in an article where they had comparisons done always a recommendation and usually more than one the important thing here is they do n't say buy this product they say buy products that have such and such feature make sure it has this in it for silky smooth hair and oh here 's an example of what we 're talking about they make you an informed shopper instead of just throwing products at you withotu reason or rhyme so in conclusion if you 're like me and can use a few extra ideas about everything in your life this is a great magazine the information is helpful applicable to normal everyday life and it 's not so full of ads that you want to choke the advertisers	2

0	at first i thought this was a great product if you only make cheese fondue it is great the pot is very easy to clean although it could be easier if it were dishwasher safe the problem i 've had with mine is that it does n't get beyond about 320 degrees the dial goes up to 400 but even after waiting for 30 minutes for it to heat up it only got up to 323 degrees and would n't go any further so if you want to use this for oil for a steak fondue it wo n't do the job well i know these kinds of appliances have to have a short cord and also a break away cord but this is ridiculous touch the darn thing and the cord falls free very frustrating if you have a lot of people trying to use it for fondue people kept telling me that the cheese was getting hard because the cord had fallen off again next time i 'd get a pot that had a thermometer built in do n't rely on the heat setting dial	2

1	this is the most unique game in recent years okami is a mixture of different gameplay prior to buying this game i was expecting more combat you control a reincarnated god wolf and travel thru many beautiful scenaries you will talk to people solve simple fun puzzles do some platforming collect weapons play mini games and fight cool enemies your goal is to save ancient japan from demons the setting is very unique its japanese mythology with cell shaded graphic which resembles ancient japanese water oil painting there are cool japanese style towns cherry blossoms trees beautiful environment and mythological enemies beast with a japanese twist a visual pleasing game you will want to see what the next level looks like its like traveling ! the bosses are really cool too ! the characters are zany and funny one disappointment is the lack of voice acting you have to read text ! minus 0 5 points for overall score the combat portion does not happen during the 'normal' game there are talisman in the environment and when you touch it the game switches into combat scenario with confined 'border' a unique aspect of this game is the 'celestrial brush' its hard to describe this gameplay but you basically draw with a brush there are many different brush powers you can draw and fill missing bridge gap draw a line thru enemies and slash them to death or draw a circle in the sky to make night turn into day these are few examples the game difficulty is pretty easy overall a fun adventure ride for everyone all ages and players graphics 4 5 5 music sound 5 5 story 5 5 gameplay 4 5 design 5 5 fun 4 5 5 value 5 5 overall 4 5	2
0	this product is worthless save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else i 've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank i'm really surprised that amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in	2

0	ok so most of the reviews i read for this film said how great it was well i for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing angelina 's breasts the acting was poor the script was stupid and the sets were lame i have seen some pretty bad movies in my time \( ie killer kondom \) but this one took the cake i would watch tromavision flicks over this one any day save your money if you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week	2
0	never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique i used stay beige \( which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique 's superfit liquid makeup i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine \) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly i also hated how clinique 's liquid foundation and powder did n't have matching shades so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder as much as i went back to macy 's to try to convince them that these were n't my shades they just would n't listen either they did n't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing instead of sitting there and arguing with them \( which i should n't have to do in the first place \) i just switched to a different makeup line laura mercier which i am very happy with i 've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand as well i'm not trying to knock the product i'm just saying it was n't for me or for many of the other people i know i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone i 'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a 20 product just because it 's affordable	2

0	i decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it the metal is thin and flimsy and the construction very poor \( e g little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose \) also it was a bit lopsided so it did not sit squarely on my counter maybe it works fine who knows the design and manufacture were so poor i did n't keep it long enough to find out	2

0	as a huge counting crows fan i thought it was kinda cool when i came across a tribute album to them right up until the time that i listened to the cd it is nearly impossible to get through the best way i can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke i rated it one star because there 's no 0 star option if you have any intentions of buying this cd find a website where you can preview it first and thank me later	2
0	i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others hoping to learn about america 's prison system i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic unfortunately in the first twenty pages of the book elsner claims that america imprisons 704 people per every 10 000 citizens if you do the math that equals 7 of our population 7 of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york according to this author there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york before you get too worried let me reassure you that this is not the case america imprisons 736 people per 100 000 citizens \( as of 5 06 \) or 736 of the population this is the highest rate in the entire world so there 's no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic for comparison stalin had 771 of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges again there 's really no need to exaggerate america 's rate of incarceration what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page but is repeated several times apparently the author actually believes we imprison 7 of our population and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover personally i ca n't take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out on the first twenty pages no less if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of 10 how do we know the rest of the book is n't off by a power of 10 \? elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine do n't buy this book	2
1	choosing our first grill really was a simple decision we knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while weber was the only way to go in our minds now that we own this grill i can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we do n't use it ! i'm really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer this grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy and for the two of us this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained highly recommended	2

1	i was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd 100 it recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in denali national park in alaska the weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents but the price and features make up for that it survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage the two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy the vestibules are very handy for storing your boots on colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though overall a good purchase	2
0	i only glanced through this book yet my first impression is that it is a hodge podge of unrelated research without any attempt to analyze or comment on the results or even the quality of the research conducted or of the tools applied i can however write about one of the editors mike shaw who made no attempt whatsoever to 'find the evidence' when assessing us as parents he works as a consultant child psychiatrist in london england and seems to specialise in offering his services as an 'expert witness' and trainer in the legal aspects of applying medical recommendations under the mental health act we had our children taken away on the grounds that they were at risk of neglect mike shaw was called in as an expert witness to interview us and make recommendations yet the reports that he submitted to court were unbelievably sloppy and ill researched under cross examination he was vague and inarticulate and could provide no concrete evidence to support his assertions and recommendations luckily for us he was so glaringly incompetent that we were allowed to repeat the process with another expert psychiatrist i do n't know about his co editors but if his work is anything to go by the material that he collated in this book can only be equally sloppy and prejudiced here are some extracts from the psychiatric report that he submitted to court judge for yourself whether you can take anything this man does or says seriously evidence gathering on 9 8 02 i interviewed mr mrs orman 2 hours on 21 8 02 i met the family at trent park where i spoke to mrs orman alone 40 mins witnessed contact 1 hour and spoke to the children without their parents 20 mins and i interviewed the foster carer 2 hours observations mr mrs orman were friendly and co operative throughout mr orman showed insight but was n't concerned that his actions may have disadvantaged the children the couple were very robust in refuting the welfare 's account which they claimed was full of misunderstandings and misinformation contact took place in the park the parents and children seemed happy to see each other they chatted in animated style i was n't aware of either parent criticising the authorities in the children 's presence interviewing the children the children seemed attentive but answered do n't know fell silent and looked at each other when i asked them questions erin related a simpsons episode where homer had lumps coming out of his head because he kept his anger inside i found myself wondering whether this was an oblique reference to concern about mr orman 's temper but guessed that such an interpretation would be dismissed note this is submitted in court as an evidence based legal document ! conclusions recommendations i observed mrs orman as shy and anxious while mr orman was very pleasant but forceful mr and mrs orman say they have an easy affectionate bond with the children so it is surprising that the foster carer finds the children uncomfortable with physical contact i think there is some insecurity in the children 's attachment to their parents note how this directly contradicts his own observations in the park were mr orman to be caring for the children on his own i would be concerned about his sensitivity to their needs asked whether he had any regrets mr orman did n't take any responsibility for the deprivation and disruption suffered by his children going into care erin who was 8 at the time needs a parent who can stand up to her without losing their temper and support and advise socially i suspect mr orman would find this difficult my concern about mrs orman managing the children on her own would be a recurrence of her illness i wonder whether mrs orman has the strength and patience to handle these very challenging sic children the children seemed very happy and natural with their parents during the contact i observed sic and the contact records make reference to the children wanting to go home returning home is likely to further retard the children 's social and emotional development these children have very little capacity to protect themselves from what is essentially emotional deprivation and possibly abuse it is most unlikely that either parent can protect the children from any harm that the other parent might cause i also find very plausible ms charlotte curran 's suggestion \( in her written statement \) that mr orman dominates his wife the children did not express a wish to return home when they spoke to me but it seems safest to assume they would prefer to be at home and would be alarmed if that was not possible i believe the children need a long term placement away from home with experienced foster carers contact should be gradually reduced mike shaw 's answers under cross examination painted a dire picture of our mental competence and subsequent parenting abilities but he was unable to point to any specific evidence that he had acquired in his 6 hour investigation yet he remained adamant in his conclusion that the children should be removed from the family indefinitely and contact gradually reduced until no further contact be allowed so that the children could lead a normal and happy life he could not comment on government statistics that show that 70 of all children placed in long term foster care end up as delinquents our children were eventually returned to us after we underwent a convoluted process to prove our competence as parents beyond a reasonable doubt and the case was eventually closed so much for the scientific and critical appraisal of our family by a man who regularly provides expert legal evidence and trains psychiatrists in making competent medical recommendations that supposedly satisfy basic human rights conventions	2

0	this app is just horrendous it is literally nothing more than a moving map i'm serious there are no features at all to make things worse when zoomed out the display is littered with the names of every little village and hamlet you 've never heard of leaving the names of recognizable towns a cities nowhere to be found also at these zoom levels most roads streets and highways are not visible making navigation impossible this app does not even come close to qualifying as a gps nav system even as a 'moving map' it 's pretty well useless unless you 're zoomed into about 300 yards even though this app was a freebie included with trips and streets 2005 \( which is a very nice capable app \) it 's still maddening that microsoft would allow such a eggregiously lame program to be released if it were possible to give this program negative stars and charge microsoft with a crime i 'd do it in a heartbeat	2

1	star wars battlefront allows you to play as some of the best troops ever such as the rebel alliance imperials republic and cis \( confederacy of independent systems \) the 3 d graphics make it easier to enjoy as well for sound and storyline in battlefront you can not play as featured characters in the saga but you get to fight alongside them in epic duels another disadvantage is you ca n't wield a lightsaber either in instant action you get to pick any location and any side to fight for you also have the choice to choose clone wars and galactic civil war as a matter of fact you can drive vehicles but no space combat ! if you want to play on episode iii battlefields your hopes are up only locations from episodes i ii iv v and vi there are numbers of areas to battle on but for pros and cons cons are going to have a hard time through the game such as what type of soldier \? where is my command post \? where is my enemy at \? for pros there is nothing wrong star wars battlefront is one of the best star wars games there is about star wars along with the perfect gameplay terrific graphics and great sound i highly recommend the game to any star wars buff 's out there	2

1	i have studied kenpo karate and several other disciplines of martial science and i can say honestly that this movie is accurate my father who is a former kenpo instructor and i both recognize things from the movie kenpo is an ancient martial art from about 2000 years ago that was formed by combining the major martial arts of the time such as kung fu tae kwon do and ju jitsu last century though an outstanding martial artist named ed parker became an expert in kenpo and americanized it jeff speakman was \( as i have been corrected \) a 4th degree black belt in american kenpo he does an excellent job of keeping what is in the movie real i especially like how a history and the philosophy of kenpo is given during the scene in which he is shown learning kenpo but do n't take my word for it go see the movie i know that a lot of people have gotten rid of the vhs players but if you have one get this movie the plot is decent and the fighting is incredible	2

1	needed it 's just as informative as macworld but more fun too read to me macworld is like reading a text book while mac addict is like learning the same information from a really funny professor i especially like the do it yourself projects that macaddict walks you through each month they range in difficulty from how to build your own mac os x icons to how to program your own video game in visual basic to how to void your warrantee by soldering crazy stuff to the motherboard these guys are seasoned mac geeks and they are n't afraid to help you become one too if you 're a super sensitive person macaddict may rub you the wrong way sometimes their editors make jokes that draw hate mail from the readers like when the polish editor in chief cracks polish jokes i do n't mind these silly things but some might to me all of the jokes usually help their articles make a more concrete and lucid point throughout the year macaddict has special issues devoted to topics like maintenance practical jokes digital media preventing disasters detailed os x guides etc i find these invaluable i'm the guy my friends ask for mac help not because i'm smarter than other people but because i 've been reading this great magazine for 6 year	2
1	i saw these skagen watches in a local clock store and fell in love with the titanium model it is extremely light and comfortable i was a little concerned about quality because it was so inexpensive for titanium though the movement is made in japan the rest of the watch is assembled somewhere else i would assume hong kong the word denmark on the face is strictly for style no part of the watches are made there regardless it seems to be very well made i 've had mine for a year now and it keeps excellent time and runs reliably i bought a different skagen model for my wife at the same time and hers is just as well made it has been a great watch and i heartily recommend it edit i have been taking swimming lessons and wearing this watch during them it has not leaked a drop i was told it was not suitable for any real depth such as those encountered while snorkeling or scuba diving but every other underwater test i 've given it it has passed	2

0	admittedly i am slightly older than the relevant demographic but i'm not 40 yet ! so there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me and i applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues still the magazine suffers from it 's unrelenting fawning over the whole post modern vibe and it 's own sense of self importance as a beacon for charismatic hipness \( hey look out world ! we jesus freaks have ipods too ! \) usually the more something or someone sweats to proclaim their own relevance the more danger there is that they can become irrelevant so like it 's spiritual cousin charisma this magazine suffers from a somewhat shallow perspective on life and culture it trumpets its ability to ask the tough questions even as it follows a relatively safe politically correct post mod charismatic hipster wannabe party line i mean their idea of being cutting edge was to put bono on the cover if you want to be cutting edge put the libertine adam clayton on the cover and ask him about bono 's faith now i would read that article ! \( i am a major u2 and bono fan i'm not knocking him just the lack of imagination at relevant \) there 's also way too much emulation of the world 's perspective on generational heritage hey we 're young and we 're smart and we do n't need to do anything the way our geezer parents did it i guess having a little gray hair or wrinkles does n't cut it in today 's paris hilton culture but i 'd like to think that it might be a little different in a culture shaped by biblical values actually relevant seems to be a little afraid to say what biblical values are \( beyond the obvious politically expedient ones \) it all seems amorphous here i 've never been a fan of the whole what 's hot what 's not ethos and i 'd like to give a little more respect to today 's christian young people to think they could handle something that did n't fall into that same faddish trap i am hopeful that they may get it right yet with relevant at times they seem tantilizingly close but it takes more than a slick hairdo male earrings chin stubble idolization of youth culture icon quotations and psycobabble cool dude theological lingo to make one relevant	2

1	i just received this set yesterday and have n't had a chance to actually bake a pizza in it yet \( i 'll try to remember to update this review once i do \) but there were a few initial impressions i thought merited a review on their own the cookbook mentioned in the title and description of this product was not actually included in the package instead the kit contained a small fold out pamphlet with four or five basic recipes and a card advertising where to obtain the aforementioned cookbook \( i doubt anyone orders this set strictly because of the cookbook or even that it sways many would be buyers who are on the fence about the value of the kit but its absence does make a small difference in the value of the purchase and is something you should know before you buy \) that having been said the pans and lid themselves look and feel so good i have no doubt whatsoever that they 'll be wonderful functional additions to my kitchen the hard anondized surface gives a distinct impression of quality and durability i'm impressed and i 'll be back to say more once i actually use them to make pizzas !	2
1	lets start off with how happy i am this finally after all these years got on dvd i remember watching this movie when i was a kid on hbo i was not more then 8 9 but i remembered it so vividly that when i decided one day to search on amazon for it i went insane when i saw that it was there ! this movie revolves around the 80 's you guy can probably tell by the cover picture its mainly about a not popular girl named louise miller who is striving to make it throught school and at the same time crushing over the most popular guy she went into a fortune telling store and the little lady who i have no idea who her name is though lol she is that lady in poterguist as well either way the fortune teller lady to her that on the night of her 16th birthday she will have her powers louise sorts of thinks the lady was crazy runs away true to the fortune tellers words she finds out the hard way she starts to believe in her powers and ability and used it for her own benifits sooner or later to make herself to become the schools most popular girl and snag the man of her dreams but then in that process she might lose her really close friend that has been with her through thick and thin since the beginning of probably grade school who knows lol but then later on she realized that her powers she has may be too much for her to handle will she give it up and go back to who she was a nobody \? or would she learn to use them wisely with the old lady 's help and fix the mess that she got herself into \? the only tibit of it was when i bought this from amazon i bought it for the price of 9 99 and then a few days later the price changed to 6 99 what a way to take the money !	2

1	i bought the laura mercier kit mini glaces with six glaces including champagne glace rose glace bare beige glace ambre rose glace petal glace and violet glace my favorite was rose but all of the colors are very beautiful i also have a full size of melon another of my favorites while the colors are beautiful provide lots of shine and are long wearing they are very sticky mac lip glass is much stickier so if you do n't mind that they might be right for you also the good thing about the kit is that you get to try lots of different colors but the tubes are quite small with a steep price so if you are willing to put up with a sticky gloss and a high price tag in exchange for some of the most beautiful colors this might be the right gloss for you	2
0	i ca n't believe none of the other reviews of the ultra lounge series state that these cd 's contain almost all instrumental music with very few songs that feature vocals i expect a lounge music cd to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks and of the four ultra lounge cd 's i purchased i count only three songs with vocals on all four of them while the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them the titles of the ultra lounge cd 's \( such as bachelor pad or bossanova \) mean very little as each cd fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks the best lounge cd i have heard so far is from an unlikely source i purchased it at pottery barn and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs keep this in mind when buying lounge music cd 's so that you wo n't be disappointed the way i was with the ultra lounge series	2
1	it 's pretty comfortable but what new mattress is n't \? the foam memory material takes a little getting used to i generally prefer a very firm mattress and had to get used to the sinking in feeling i 've also found you ca n't really use a lot of pillows what i like about it is that if someone else tosses and turns or gets out of bed you do n't feel it the smell people are referring to is like an industrial product smell but it is n't as obnoxious as it 's made out to be but definitely present if ignored it will linger for about a month or so i did n't try to spray anything on it because it did n't really bother me that much over all it 's a good mattress although not the greatest thing since sliced bread i'm sure it will last a lot longer than a regular mattress and feel i 've definitely gotten my moneys worth i would recommend it	2

0	this is what you want \( 1983 \) was a terrible album from john lydon and martin atkins after an rift between keith levene and john lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks atkins and lydon ran keith off and he quit the band instead of keeping him on the finished tracks atkins and lydon removed levene and pete jones \( the band 's studio bassist \) from the audio tracks and re recorded themwith members from their holiday inn band \( lydon hired members from a covers band who performed at a new jersey holiday inn \) the new tracks and horrible all of the guitar riffs and rhythmsection that were originally recorded for the future album were erased noise and other unwelcomed sounds were added to the tracks the original tracks were far superior \( even in their basic state \) to what was released to hear them you 'll have to find the commercial zone lp the failure of this disc and the bickering between atkins and lydon would cause the band to become a solo project for the former anarchy king not recommended	2

1	i mainly use the camcorder for recording my kids i bought this camcorder a couple of weeks ago i had the sony hc 7 before for a couple of weeks which i returned to buy the canon camcorder the high light performance of both camcorders are excellent with the sony camcorder i felt that the best color performance can be achieved by reducing the color intensity the low light performance when recording 1080i is similar for the two camcorders but much better with canon when recording in 24p format this is the main reason that i prefer the canon the 24p recording is more sensitive to motion which can be a problem if recording motion the still images from canon are lower resolution but to me they looked better than sony this is especially true when taking flash pictures the sony seems a little better built the hdmi cover on canon is poorly built i liked the controls on canon better than sony the auto focus and automatic white balance worked better in canon than in sony the auto white balance in sony worked poorly in indoor light sony has supershot infrared recording and canon does not sony has more manual controls than canon	2

1	i bought this because i was moving from boston ma to phoenix az and driving myself and my 2 daughters i was able to fill this thing to maximum capacity and was able to fit a small padlock on the zipper to secure it shut it rained and snowed on our trip and luckily we had everything already wrapped up in plastic bags this is not a waterproof cargo bag but rather water resistant when we got to phoenix i noticed that the front part of the bag had frayed and a hole formed i think this was more do to the straps that were hanging and hitting it than poor craftsmanship i recommend this bag if you are doing a short trip but not for long haul trips with a lot of highway driving good points was able to fill it really well was very easy to installnot so good straps really ca n't be secured down and end up flapping in the win	2
1	as one might suspect gta san adreas has the classic anarchist fun with insane driving guns galore and a lawless protagonist and a linear storyline let 's be honest though nobody buys gta to just play the mission part and in fact i have a hard time getting into the missions in san andreas there is an even larger area of gameplay and a few other cities to explore once you have advanced in the game \( unless you want to cheat \) the clear aspect that sets this game apart from the previous ones is the depth of gameplay haircuts and tattoos are available for purchase you have various parts of your character that can be built up fat hunger muscle driving skill weapon skill etc obviously when you get fat you need to run around and eat when hungry the others are self explanatory some new and rather interesting vehicles ave been added to this game the hydra which is a harrier type jet the stunt plane an attack helicopter a four wheeler a parachute and my favorite the jetpack other than that the game is like each created before it from gta 3 on the graphics even on a fairly modern computer still leave much to be desired whatever engine they use is clearly the same as gta 3 animation on the other hand is very natural and realistic music from the radio stations is lackluster but i believe it is possible to use your own music instead as a computer game san adreas' controls at the very least awkward because of the sheer number of actions that can be done in the worst case scenario the hydra however using a keyboard to fly the plane is downright nerveracking if you want to shoot something below you be sure to compensate by a couple of seconds not because it moves fast but because you need that time to angle the nose of the plane in that direction i myself use an xbox controller which has an adapter to use the usb port on the computer even with that it is not much better and you still need the d pad to make decent turns as you can tell this is my biggest qualm with the game overall grand theft auto san andreas has a lot to offer if you do n't have a regular gaming console but that is compensated by the clumsy keyboard controls i would rate it a 7 out of 10	2
0	i got this for my s70 first off in order to use it you have to set the s70 to radio control \( about 9 button pushes \) then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so \( and only in front of the camera the remote does n't work from the rear ! \) oh and if you want to adjust your framing forget it the zoom is immobilized if you need a cable release i strongly suggest simply using the self timer built into the camera it gives you 2 second and 10 second settings and you 're almost certain to have a steady tripod by that time	2
1	tazo teas is a relative newcomer to the tea market having been founded in 1994 by steve smith but what tazo lacks in history it makes up for in pure inventiveness ! among tazo 's many blends is passion a bold and flavorful mixture of hibiscus flowers other tropical flavors citric acid orange peel licorice root cinnamon bark rose hips lemongrass and red poppy brew it up and you are rewarded with a bright red infusion that has a tart and exciting taste now this tea is definitely not for everyone as you can tell from the ingredients this tea is strong and decidedly on the tart side when drunk hot you probably will want to sweeten it with honey or moderate it with milk or possibly both but when made into an iced tea passion really comes into its own decidedly refreshing and thirst quenching just what you need for a hot summer day ! so overall i would say that this is a pretty darn good hot tea and a great iced tea buy some today	2

0	the author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological philosophical foundations of the emerging confession there is value in that i look forward to reading part two the liturgical ideas section the emerging church is keen on praxis but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within christendom which i had hoped we were past here are some things that i am amazed do not occur to the others reviewing this book which it might help to know 1 rollins does not think it 's possible to really know much theology with certainty in fact to claim to have religious certainty is to hold an idolatrous view of god that is more our idea of god than really who god is this is because it is virtually impossible to be objective for us humans and because in his view god was not all that interested in presenting much of himself in any sort of nailed down way the irony i could not miss was the dogmatism with which he himself expresses his own views he is very certain of his interpretations of perceptive thinkers like nietzsche freud and marx eckhart augustine etc and is very certain that his interpretations of the scattered verses from scripture are correct i found his use of proof texting for his ideas to be really really faulty as i'm reading along i kept jotting in the margins all the times what he said was a really pretty clear misunderstanding of the new testament so be prepared for a frustrating read if you know the bible 's basic content he is certain that no one should be certain but him ok to be fair he is not certain if christianity is true and says so on page 44 but he is certain that he should not be certain of christianity nor i guess should you with his view of critique of ideology how can he be so selective of what he is certain of this seems like a self defeating ideology so strong is his disdain for knowing with any real certainty that he would do away with apologetics as if it were no longer appropriate to try to base our beliefs on reason at all i was reminded of the case francis schaeffer made quite well regarding those who do not have any reason to believe something is true but who take a leap of faith and believe it anyway rollins needs to reread his francis schaeffer in my opinion he says the church is not to be about giving answers but helping raise in people questioning indeed given his views how could he provide answers \? this book may look deep i propose it is merely muddy 2 he redefines age old terms orthodoxy is no longer about the content of what one believes but how loosely one holds it certainty of revealed truth is dangerous misinformed idolatrous heresy is now a cute little thing it has come of age he says people will think his views undermine christianity we are to just take him at his word that his views wo n't do so but he does not really make affirmations to give any reasonable comfort and any one would i think see the writing on the wall 3 he seems to think the emerging church is the only hope for unity or evangelism in our time among post moderns after reading his views i wonder if it is possible for post moderns those like himself at least to even understand the gospel he has not how can he be a bridge \? to be a bridge one must have footing on both shores christianity is based on real events with real content that has been passed down not without mystery nor without debate but in a very real and tangible way he cannot be a bridge to something by changing that thing to something else 4 he is right to be kind to people of other religions and to try to learn from them the problem that is huge and no one seems to notice is that he seems incapable of learning or appreciating the christians who are in other camps he considers fundamentalists and by logical extension many evangelicals to be pharisees and the true heretics in his new definition of the term heresy i kept thinking what kind of fundamentalists is he so angry at \? he blasts the whole of that group and by extension most evangelicals making generalizations that are misleading very unobjective unkind very divisive yet he thinks only his views can bring unity to christendom i can see his views bringing unity to all religions but it will never bring unity to christendom he seems oblivious to the amazing amount of unity that now exists in christendom times have really changed in the past 20 years he is either unaware or has a different kind of unity in mind 5 he makes god hopelessly difficult god wanted it seems to speak in a plain brown wrapper the common language of the people the dust of humanity the lowly donkey ride the obscure but simple truth of the simple gospel rollins has wrapped god up in nietzsche and while disdaining human reason as the means of knowing god has turned the living christ who said i am the truth into an enigma of mental gymnastics that is so complex only man could concoct it god 's message is simple it 's clear where it needs to be it hints at huge mystery beyond what is stated rollins makes it nearly all enigma hinting at some possible truth out there from a winking god who says out of one side of his mouth something is important and that we will be held accountable for knowing and obeying it yet who has been unwilling or incapable given man 's weaknesses or his own lack of communication skills to articulate it in such a way that a person can hold any theological content soundly if as tickle says this is the christianity of the 3rd millenium then the chrisitan faith is about to become the irrational man 's religion the anything goes religion and following generations will have to deconstruct today 's extreme and irrational over reaction to fundamentalism peter i can learn some stuff from you and i'm sure some of my perception of what you were trying to say was likely lost in transmission as it stands now i cannot agree with you on several points your views trouble me nothing against you personally forgive any kind of perceived condescending tone i hope to enjoy the rest of your book much more though it will for me be an upper story with out a first floor regardless if it inspires i 'll come back and add a star hmmm	2
0	to cover all the problems with continuity logic theology geography and plain common sense in left behind would take a whole book one hardly knows where to start perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel as such it is n't even a decent trashy novel instead of steamy sex scenes we get sanctimonious sermonizing worse than that what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it 's too late the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario \( an idea with virtually no scriptural support \) little in the characters' actions thought processes or dialog rings true one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student god ends up looking like the ultimate villain demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear \? who is the present day equivalent of c s lewis or catherine marshall and why are n't they getting more attention \? these were writers who actually made you think lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non believers in such a world might ask one wonders if they have ever met a non believer at all or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter these days it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted bigoted caricature of what it once was perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured if left behind is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind	2

0	while the sound of the stream is relaxing and well recorded there are way too many birds around the cd describes their sound as distant and faint but that 's far from accurate the parts of the cd where all you hear is the stream alone do n't add up to more than 10 minutes and never last more than a minute for the most part you will hear the stream and plenty of birds rather close and sometimes very loud buyer beware the 30 second samples you get here are precisely from the parts with no birds at all ! very misleading	2

1	it 's always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices it 's a pleasure to hold and use this bottle i like not having to tip your head up to drink since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom i 've never seen this design before easy to flip open with one hand yet you do n't have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs absense of taste compared to plastic bottlesi do n't like diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way it takes a lot of force to push it in about 2 3 of the way and it does n't go further it has n't flown out during riding yet but i am looking for a wider cage now \( not easy to find \) why not make it standard diameter for bike cages	2

1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	2

1	i heard the first beat lp \( quot i just ca n't stop it quot \) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band 's brand of ska soul rock for some strange reason i never bought quot wha'ppen quot and never got familiar with it i confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away of course i did buy quot special beat service quot and found it to be par excellent so i ordered quot wha'ppen quot a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and i 've been wearing it out damn ! how did i miss this \? this is a great collection of snaky sweet politically smart songs quot doors of your heart quot i 've loved that song for years and quot too nice to talk to quot has always been a favorite but every other single song on this cd including the bonus tracks is outstanding these songs are textural wonders great stinging guitar work and the incredible saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording i regret not discovering it sooner but it sure is a nice find after the fact oh yeah one more thing i had the pleasure of meeting dave wakeling in nashville this past summer and he 's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him if he comes to a venue near you do n't miss the show you 'll get your money 's worth and more wear your dancin' shoes he is truly one of the great talents of the 80 's and continues to make significant music he may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades buy this cd you wo n't regret it it sounds best in the early evening i'm the big oh and i gotta go	2

1	maybe it 's because i was upgrading from an older version 2002 but i found the new features to be very good for example the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used it was catching junk from the very beginning and has missed very few things i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use installation was seemless i think it might be a little overpriced but considering how long i will keep it it 's not too bad	2
0	bayer is a name brand aspirin any brand name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin i give this a one star rating not because it is a poor product rather because it is so expensive the dosage is 81 mg taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes \( generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis have had a heart attack or stroke \) aspirin is a wonder drug the very first analgesic anti inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago it is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis bone inflammation joint pain and even reduces fever aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other thus it thins the blood and prevents blood clots from forming aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes some folks take a baby aspirin \( 81 160 mgs \) each day to prevent blood clots from forming aspirin is actually acetyl salicylic acid manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion to make digestion easier some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach \( like ecotrin \) regular aspirin without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset for these folks the buffered form is a god send unfortunately aspirin fell out of favor in the 60 's and 70 's when reye 's syndrome developed in some children \( under the age of 16 \) who took aspirin while they had the flu and or chickenpox about 30 of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage because of reye 's syndrome alternate analgesics were placed on the market the premier being tylenol there is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult as reye 's syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age the usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg with the extra strength form at 500 mg most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg \( 2 tablets \) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5 200 mg \( some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg day with a doctor 's supervision \) there is no additional benefit to taking more than 1 000 mg every 4 hours increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood thinning medications those with stomach ulcers and used with caution in insulin dependent diabetics allergies can develop to aspirin as well never mix aspirin with any of the non steroidal anti inflammatories such as ibuprofen as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased do n't mix aspirin with alcohol either as it is hard on the stomach used properly aspirin is a terrific medication i prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form one pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name brand manufacturer however the big manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better jim konedog koenig	2
0	i own many sony products including a sony cybershot dsc f717 which i love however i am very disappointed by this camera the sony cybershot dsc t5 i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present it is small lightweight portable easy to use and stylish it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments especially outside however after several months of use a few problems have become consistently evident \( 1 \) there is horrible red eye \( and white eye \) artifact in many pictures the so called red eye reduction setting does nothing \( 2 \) dim light photography is very grainy with lots of noise night time photography is impossible these problems are not unique to our camera you will find many corroborating reviews above overall i am very disappointed in this camera and wish i could exchange it for something else do not buy this camera other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures \( and they are still small pocket size cameras \)	2
0	at first i was very happy with this stroller i love the big wheels the front one which swivels the cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby and the adjustable handle is awesome because i'm short and i can push the stroller at a comfortable height also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall museum park or on city streets one of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back there is a drawstring that you must adjust this requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative despite this i still loved the stroller until recently however after only two months of use my stroller will not lock it has actually folded up on my son while pushing it i now cannot even seem to lock it into the open position for use i have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open and because the stroller folds outward not inwards like an umbrella stroller it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out this is very dangerous i am contacting the manufacturer about this defect	2

1	i'm really surprised at the negative reviews on these wipers i bought two pairs of wipers just over a year ago expecting i 'd have the second pair as backup i have n't needed the second pair the first pair are still just like new they do n't squeak chatter or smear and are great for visibility i live in seattle so it 's not like i never use them either we 've been deluged by rain in the last year ! the only thing i can think is that maybe others are mistreating their wiper blades keep your windshield clean and if the wipers are smearing just wipe the cleaning edge off with a paper towel from time to time that 's not a problem with the blade that 's a problem with the cleanliness of your windshield and blade any wiper blade struggles when it 's bogged down with dirt pollen and road grime i figure eventually i 'll use my backup pair but until then i'm happy	2

1	i really loved this dvd there is some information for everybody beginners as well as advanced there is also a nice presence from paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album i was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing this dvd without being too personnal made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man i also enjoyed the discovery of the south african music their traditions and influence as described by some of the musician of that country the many footages of the countryside were a pleasure which worked perfectly with graceland songs the anecdotes are meaningful witty funny deep depending on the situation none of them self indulgent or egotistical this dvd is a truly great journey with one of the most influential folk composer 's i would rank this dvd up there with the clash west way to the world and u2 the making of the joshua tree	2

1	i am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product since amazon toys r us do n't seem to have a clue even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer i bought this in store at toys r us because sizing information was not available online \( except for the size of the box for some bizarre reason \) and i did n't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size so let me share that information with you this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20 5 to 22 i think overall that this is a great set but i marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection from my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard i can say that i would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me but with a young child who knows \? ! this is for my neice \( i am not a parent \) and whilst i am generally happy with the set as it is i think it would be nice to include the elbow protection \( which is afterall available in other sets but does not appear to be available separately \) to make a complete safety package perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads or perhaps i am a touch too cynical	2

0	i wish i could give this stroller 0 stars because it does n't even deserve the one i gave it it 's a light stroller there the only plus where do i start how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because i did n't have a reciept \( it was shower gift \) after arguing with their lack luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as i had been using it they shipped a new wheel free of charge fast forward to our vacation in hawaii the sun shade is non existent and i had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun the steering stinks i have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves and does n't hold anything but a small water bottle the basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward my husband and i went on a hike and came to the end of the path that was n't paved he asked me are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand \? i replied please i hope someone takes this piece of 8 ! ! 8 ! ! ! end of story i would n't invest in the pliko p3 either do n't get me started in the peg perego car seat either junk ! !	2
0	i expected much better quality from thule as used according to the manufacturers recomendations this bag did not even last one trip from new york to chicago without it 's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off in addition the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car the contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that 's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car this becomes a terrible distraction while driving all in all i had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers they cost much more but are worth every penny in the end i thought i was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a sears x cargo container to replace it for my return trip back	2
1	this was my first watch that was over 100 dollars i was just getting into watches and wanted something that looked great and would stand the test of time this watch is beautiful the polished look wo n't last forever if worn daily but even when battle scarred this watch still looks classy i love that battery replacement is pretty much a non issue with this watch its titanium design makes it so light and comfortable that you might forget you are wearing it the dial window is pretty resilient but i would not test that too much this is for the most part a dress watch i also have an invicta abyss automatic diving watch that i wear occasionally but i do n't wear it nearly as much as i wear my citizen my citizen is my favorite watch of all time its versatility and longevity have impressed me in the three years that i have owned it i recommend this watch for anyone who wants a beautiful watch that is dressy and still practical for most daily life i always get compliments about it also this watch is a good buy	2
0	i saw this movie about two weeks ago and i ca n't believe how disappointed i am for this i was expecting fireworks instead i got a truckload of bad karma on my head not only that but it maybe the most over the top film i ever saw and it will be on my list of the worst movies i ever saw to begin with half of the characters die in this film and i was like 'what is the meaning \? ' then there 's the film 's signature moment in which sinatra wakes up from his nightmare and they do it in such a matter that they put his face right at the camera again i said to myself 'what 's the point \? ' and then there 's the chilling climax which would be totally ripped off a year later by the kennedy assassination from the scoped rifle right down to james gregory 's character getting shot in the head in one of the documentries to this dvd director william fredkin says that there is no doubt this movie caused lee harvey oswald to kill president kennedy because 'oswald realized that he was raymond shaw ' if he 's right that raises the question did he do it by his beliefs or did someone push him over \? then fredkin ends his obseravation by saying that the release of the manchurian candidate and the death of president kennedy are the two events that made the 1960 's what it is and why people today \( including me \) are still obessed with that decade in conclusion i think this was a big disappoinment and this movie is on the list of afi 's 100 greatest films \? please	2

1	when i got the machine and started putting it together i noticed i was missing a few small pieces understandable i think as this machine was shipped from germany 3 and a trip to my local hardware store later the kettler kadett was all assembled i had some problems with the foot straps loosening while i exercised but i found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area \( to provide an additional foot strap \) and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem with the exception of those minor nuisances the kettler kadett is an amazing piece of machinery when i use it i can tell it 's not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts it went together easily and it 's solid as a rock when i use it i 've never rowed on a real boat in my life but this feels just as i 'd imagine it would and of course the most important part when i get off i feel like i 've gotten a gym quality work out 4 out of 5 stars for this rowing machine the packaging could have been better and slightly re designed foot wraps but all in all an excellent buy	2
0	this lite brite is a piece of junk ! do n't wast your money ! maybe if i were n't comparing it to the older one i would think it was ok but even then i am not sure i loved my lite brite as a kid and wanted to get my daughter one so she could have as much fun as i did with mine this has not left the box since the first day first all of the screens where you stick the pegs are white not black like the old one so without the refill sheets it is useless also without the refill sheets the pegs are too big and they do not stay in this was very frustrating ! even with the sheets sometimes they still fall out ! i am really unhappy with this purchase and i can usually find something about a toy i like but not this one i just did n't want anyone to be deceived into thinking that the screens were black and you could make your own art	2

1	this is a thuroughly enjoyable movie a pleasure to watch the acting characters and story are entirely plausible and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors nor is there any of hollywood 's usual political preachiness \( especially unusual considering robert redford 's backing \) the only downside to the dvd is that it is full screen and not letterboxed the bonus features are somewhat lack luster as well and the menu system is laughable only one actor 's credits have been updated since the movie was released and the credits section is a token gesture at best still this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice	2

1	i saw the movie in a theater when it first came out i was a teenager and although i believed it to be primarily a girl 's movie i did enjoy it i 've seen it several times since then and it still has not lost its charm when i finally did read the book i was disappointed that the movie did n't follow it more closely to me these are two different stories the holly in the movie is likeable the novella 's holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else \( when my wife saw the movie she remarked that holly was an idiot \) however the book 's storyline is more interesting more haunting and the book 's ending is more intriguing the movie ends as a love story the book is much more and oh yes whatever you may think of capote as an individual the guy was a damn good writer	2

0	i bought my kodak v570 less than a year ago at first the only annoyance i had was the fact that i had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in mov format that made it diffcult to edit but a few months ago the focus refused to work properly in wide angle it was fine but when i zoomed in the image was unacceptably blur i tried every setting finally gave up and called kodak service i was asked to mail the camera to sydney from melbourne where i live a few weeks later the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it since i still could not take acceptable pictures i contacted them again this time to be told to send pictures via e mail i did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images but the pictures were taken in broad daylight when i disagreed with the logic of the comment i was told to call them for a discussion over the phone but the number they gave me was a fax number using my resources i got in touch with technical service by phone this time i was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright it 's probably due to shaky hands ! it 's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives it is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent india trip when many of the pictures turned out blur now i have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people there is no way i will ever buy another kodak again i can recommend it only to my worst enemies i have now to again send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far i am not holding my breath for answers still want to buy a kodak \? go ahead but do n't say i did not warn you by the way my other camera is a casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not	2

1	well i echo what all the other reviews have said about this magazine subscibing to this magazine is making sure that unbiased articles can still exist for all makes and models of sports cars you see there are extremely few ads in this magazine and so even though the mag is a bit smaller than say a car and driver magazine it is loaded front to back with reviews one after another the photography is fantastic and just looking at the pictures makes you wonder what some of the other mainstream magazines could be like if they could just try to put out a better quality product even the cardstock of the paper is first rate it makes the car and driver mag feel so cheap in comparison both come to my address and i honestly can say that i look forward to both but for different reasons i first stumbled upon this magazine at an airport 6 years ago and i am so glad that i did i would love to see more articles with affordable sports car alternatives as they print at the end of each issue i remember an article about what used sports cars you could buy with certain dollar amounts and this was to me \( a man on a budget \) a rather nice look at the market as a whole that year also we are not all 16 year olds out there subscirbing to this magazine so it would be nice to see road tests on at least one moderatly priced non exotic each issue thank you for putting together such a high quality magazine for your readers to enjoy	2
0	this razor is not worth the money it did shave pretty well for a few months but the rubber strips wear out really quickly and even though the cleaning option with the fluid seems like a great idea it does not work very well the razor was never clean and refilling the fluid is just a pain i would not recommend this razor	2
1	i ca n't say enough how great this album is grant green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who ever graced the planet his soloing on this cd is filled with beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a pleasure to listen to and for me as a guitarist it has been an encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective my favorites are quot miss ann 's tempo quot and quot blues for willarene quot it is such a shame that he died so young and never collected his just due	2

1	true as other reviewers have stated this is not a gate that will swing open unless you use the hardware which i have not so i cannot comment on how well that works as a tension or pressure mounted gate i love this item i have no problems stepping over it and i'm only 5' 5 so i never found it to be a nuisance it 's easy to use with one hand and snaps into place easily it 's also easy to adjust the size to fit different sized door openings although that takes two hands it 's light enough that i can carry my 13 month old son on one arm and the gate in the other as i travel from floor to floor my 2 year old is learning to sleep in a room by herself so we use the gate at the doorway so that she can call to us from her room without being free to wander into the hallway or onto the stairs again we love the fact that we do n't have to damage the molding on the doorframes my husband and i are so satisfied with this item that we plan on buying another one	2
0	i bought this dvd for my daughter who is from china and though i think xiao foo is adorable i am disappointed by big bird 's behavior not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way but he tells barkley at one point to sic the monkey king and then later again frustrated tells the monkey king to put his dukes up \( as if to fight to resolve the issue \) i am appalled by this big bird is also somewhat demeaning to the chinese people he encounters they do n't understand him because he is speaking english and rather than explain the language barrier he just gets upset i love sesame street and although i will keep this dvd to hear xiao foo sing in chapter 7 \( our daughter just loves her \) i feel i will need to use big bird 's behavior as an example of how not to act	2

0	first of all please realize that the customer pictures of this item are totally off this thing is a foot cube so there 's no way you could fit any baby outside of a newborn inside of it that being said when the cube first showed up it seemed ok outside of the size and my 2 1 2yr old son and 9 month old daughter seemed to enjoy it that is until my son realized that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no way for the elmo block to move at all shoddy at best we 've had this cube for a total of 3 days now and already at least 4 stickers are off of it due to not being placed center on the piece they were on or just low quality stickers my children still play with the cube as currently it provides no real safety hazard but the price i paid for this cube was entirely too much considering the low quality	2

0	i got these when my son was 12 months old and already a strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls of food onto his high chair tray trying to outsmart him i purchased these hoping to keep some food in a bowl much to my disappointment they only stick to the formica countertops well the littlest one does n't even stick to that none of them stays on my son 's plastic high chair tray for more than a second or two on the upside the lids are secure once shut all the way \( which can take a little work \) so they make great storage for on the go finger foods in the diaper bag i have n't had one leak yet and i put things like applesauce in them to test them not a total waste of money now that i found this alternate use they wash well without any noticeable breakdown of the plastic on the top rack of the dishwasher	2

1	nowadays hollywood just would n't have the balls to make a film that spits in the face of terrorism unless it was an easy target that does n't spit back \( aka america and it 's 1st amendment \) this film harkens back to the day when people wished our country 's foreign policy was a bit more leathery well ya got it now ! at the very least a film like this would piss off the surrender monkeys in the jackass party not only for what they would see as a glorification of nationalistic jingoism but for the villification and slaughter of stalinistic castro like communists that they would only want to capitulate and make peace with makes one wonder if the lefty glenn close now hates herself for acting in such a film what would they say to a film like this \? unfortunately there 's plenty of room for criticism in this movie aside from the political implications therein some \( arguably if not all \) of the special effects seemed a bit hokey \( hence the 4 stars instead of the five \) i think if anyone wanted to be bipartisan about anything it would have to be the 90 's style cgi especially the plane crash at best one might go so far as to say it was cute and what can a guy like me say to that \? even as i write this review scarcely 2 days have past from the red letter day in the struggle against terrorism in which the ruthless terrorist leader of al qaida in iraq al zarqawi caught himself a couple of 500 lb bombs with the use of his house for those who want to keep westerners depressed and demoralized \( not a far stretch from fear mongering right \? \) in the fight against terrorism this deals a disappointing blow to those who hate america what 's worse they ca n't seem to ban a film exalting american nationalism such as air force one from those who wish to see it \( oh no ! \) and just 2 years ago the same whiners were bitching about the passion sucks to have the 1st amendment apply to every american and not just the idealistic intellectual few does n't it	3

1	great movie ! delivery of the order came in good time this 2 disc collector 's edition comes with some interesting extras i found the offtakes blubbers to be in bad taste but the rest of the extras were worth seeing personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie although it is interesting to watch especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself just my personal preference no doubt others will have different opinions	3

1	nominated for best actor \( massimo troisi \) best adapted screenplay best music best director and best picture il postino is a tender tale of love and poetry on a small island in the mediterranean sea inspired by an incident in the life of pablo neruda the chilean poet who was briefly exiled in 1952 for his communist ideas which have often got him into trouble 'il postino' is a beautiful heartbreaking movie funny in its simplicity and honest dialog massimo troisi leaves his final legacy in the role of a shy hesitant and uncultured postman who possesses the heart of a poet with truly peculiar observations such as 'the whole world is the metaphor for something else ' often without realizing how exciting his comments are director michael radford had the care to create a wonderful film which floats on the love of words rhythm and imagery his movie is much heightened by a music score that includes quotes paraphrases and argentinean tangos his film turns out to be a great little movie it deals with a friendship between a lethargic villager who takes the modest job of delivering letters to the celebrated poet living in a secluded area poetry becomes their connection mario ruoppolo is a simple man with a complicated set of values who rides his bicycle climbing the hard road to neruda 's cozy home and with his timid manners delivers the armful of correspondence to the single customer of the island a polite neruda shows little interest in his personal postman but he favors him one day with his autograph signing one of his books with the words 'regards pablo neruda ' nevertheless as time passes the 'poet of love' becomes a bit more friendly intrigued by mario 's enthusiasm regarding his poetry and poetic manner of speaking mario impressed that almost every letter delivered to neruda is from a female could n't understand how his new resident despite his advancing age has such magical power over women so he tries with his simple way of thinking to understand all the secrets of the exalted poet sharing his thoughts with him he becomes increasingly curious asking a lot of questions about the mystical creation of poetry forcing the fascinating celebrity to reveal some of the unexposed materials of his artistic vision neruda introduces mario to the verbal rupture of metaphors attempting to teach them to his anxious pupil the two men discover an unexpected friendship based on their mutual view that life should be a framework for seduction and romance as the film goes on mario crafted with a tender spirit attempts through pablo a gentle intervention and poetry to win over the woman he has fallen for beatrice russo played by sicilian fashion model maria grazia cucinotta becoming in a slow way his 'latin cyrano de bergerac ' neruda guides his postman into romance but refuses to write a poem that could charm his young passionate beatrice to attract the prettiest girl in town mario becomes a bit of a poet himself but when he finds his own words insufficient to his romantic mission he appropriates one of his tutor 's sensuous poems and protests when discovered that poetry does n't belong to those who write it but to those who need it unbelievably his 'lyrical words' fascinate the sensual bombshell who was playing a mean game of table soccer in a low cut dress but disturb greatly her disapproving aunt donna rosa who sees that mario is contaminating her niece with his nice words nevertheless the postman wins the beautiful beatrice and convinces her to marry him heartbreak comes when neruda receives a telegram that he can return to the country he loves so much from here on an extended epilogue with smiles tears and regret takes the story on and the film almost breathes lyrical tenderness in its depiction of an honest man who longs so much for love mario who has not received any word or greeting from the poet and had remarked that it 's quite normal for the poet not to remember him returns to the poet 's villa to revisit the place that had once been alive with the sounds and sights of emotional discovery in the silence that now surrounds it he realizes that the poet has taken all the beautiful things away with him he gets the idea to create a 'live' poem for his dearest friend don pablo an outdoors tape to let him listen to the wonderful sounds of the island from the small and big waves at the cala di sotto to the wind on the cliffs to the wind through the bushes to the sad nets belonging to his father to the church bell of our lady of sorrow to the starry sky over the island to pablito 's heartbeat philippe noiret \( best remembered for 'cinema paradiso' \) charms us once again as the affectionate mentor to mario he convinces the postman that poets are quite human but warns mario about the old dictaphone saying 'even the most sublime ideas sound ridiculous if heard too often 'the sets and the cinematography accompanied by an oscar winning score create a wonderful atmosphere of the remote poor island with no running water of the modest houses with pealing plaster of the rocky cliffs overlooking the blue mediterranean of the post war fishing village under the shades of rose and salmon like love itself some great movies seem surprisingly human delbert mann 's 'marty' was one cameron crowe 's 'say anything ' was another and now michael radford 's il postino is exceptional his film stands tall in its own right as a 'must see' movie it 's tough to imagine anyone not liking it it simply revives our memories and breaks our heart	3

1	i used this to haul a 75 pound 74 inch long flat pack furniture box about 100 miles on top of a 1994 toyota camry and it worked just fine i had my doubts when i bought it i lost an upholstered chair on the washington dc beltway once tied it down with rope and it took off like a kite but this highland carrier did the job when putting it together save yourself some aggravation and loop the straps through the plastic bases before you attach the bases to the crossbars \( the instructions tell you to do the reverse which makes the threading next to impossible \) the pieces attached firmly to the roof of my camry with flat metal hooks going on the sills of the open doors once the doors are closed there 's no way the hooks can come out make sure the straps are tight before you close the doors this can be a little tricky as there seemed to be some slippage through the buckles but with a little tugging and wiggling they snugged up pretty well note that the rubber feet that fit on the plastic bases provide grip and protect your roof when the carrier is on but they fall off easily when it 's not in use i do n't know why they were n't permenently attached the maximum recommended load is 150 pounds but i did n't test it to the limit the crossbars look sturdy but they 're hollow metal tubes and they bounced a little under the weight of the box also the bars have a textured finish but seemed a little slippery so i wrapped some gritty no slip tape around them \( the kind used on stairsteps \) to prevent any slippage i attached the box to the carrier with two ratchet tie downs \( highly recommended over rope \) the tie down straps were looped once around the box and under each crossbar and the box did n't budge the whole trip home one other thing make sure to tie up any dangling straps the sound of them whacking against the roof of your car can be very disconcerting an inexpensive solution that 's good for temporary use with light loads on short trips in cars that do n't have roof racks update used the carrier to haul two of the same box on the camry bringing the load right up to the 150 lb maximum rock solid all the way i laid the long boxes side by side with the longest width down to spread out the weight as much as possible then duct taped them together and fastened them down good and tight with tie downs and rope \( overkill \? perhaps but better safe than sorry and sued \) my next car will probably be a small suv but until then i'm glad i have this carrier inexpensive easy to use and remove and does the job	3

1	inc magazine is a publication designed to guide small businesses on their path to prosperity with inc you get timely advice on taxes marketing financing and many other important considerations and challenges that business owners face every day probably the strongest point of inc is the way it presents important information to readers the authors of this magazine get directly to the point they do n't waste your time with petty discussions and attempts to soften the blow of an undesirable fact even when the news is bad like with regulations taxation etc inc lets you have it in a direct manner this is good because i get annoyed by magazines that try to ease the reader into hearing some unwelcome news and then try to downplay the facts inc writers are direct and i respect them for that if there were some criticisms to be made about this magazine i can think of only two the lack of articles geared toward startup businesses and the tendency of the magazine to highlight success stories that while nice to read about present personal success that is a little out of reach of most business owners inc is designed for small businesses that are already established and need some guidance for growth this is fine but i would like it a little better of there were more articles on getting a new business off the ground and every now and them the magazine goes off on a tangent and interviews someone who is very rich again this is ok but i would prefer to read about ordinary people who are only moderately well off because these stories and the individual level of success they portray are more realistic still inc is a very good publication for small business owners it provides some good timely advice on how to help your young business grow and how to handle legal issues and concerns the price to subscribe is low too making inc magazine a must for owners of small growing companies	3
1	i dedicate this review to women all around the world of all colour races religions nationality and creed \( all women are equal in my eyes nigel \) in this remarkable novel sk makes his debut an unlikely but good book it has a good dose of horror suspense and it is one of the best books i have ever read it is simply about a teenager from maine named carietta white \( carrie \) from the beginning of the story we see who her mother \( margaret white \) takes advantage of her making her feel stupid and left out similiarly in school carrie is always the black sheep she has not friends and she is always picked upon she is very unusual and strange at least to most people especially the ones in the book \( story \) \( but i would say quite frankly that i did n't see here as anybody but a normal healthy teenage girl \) at the beginning of the story we also see that carrie has her first period while taking a shower at school she is laughed at and all the other girls throw toilet paper and tampons at her this is her first big humiliation \( i am a guy i know not much about a period so please forgive my use of the term openly \) anyway back to the plot carrie soon realizes that she is psychic she starts to practice using her powers gradually it seems as though she had the powers since birth but the powers were dormant until puberty or at least she was unaware of it so so far we see this a very unusual girl with psychic powers and a stupid mother the story initially and mostly circulates around these facts but things get a little messy towards the middle and end allow me it is later revealed in the story that the psychic gift is sort of genetic carrie 's mother explains alot of things but she is still a bad mother \( but i still ca n't hate carries 's mother because most mothers are sort of protective over their children \) soon carrie gets her first friend sue sue feels sorry for carrie and helps her to get a date for the prom this date is tommy ross meanwhile one of the bad girls chris is unable to attend the prom so she sets up a nasty revenge against carrie believe me when i tell you chris is a very jealous girl and if she ca n't have something no one else can especially carrie so chris arranges a trap for carrie \( two buckets of pig blood \) she sets it up for the pig blood to fall on carrie 's and tommy 's head while at the prom the plan eventually succeeds tommy is badly injured drenched in pig 's blood carrie is laughed at for the last time she runs out of the building she then remembers her psychic powers and decides to use it for revenge she starts to close all the doors she then turns on all the water sprinklers wetting everyone but with a combination of water and electricity \( from the appliances \) some were electrocuted eventually a fire gets started and things start to burn ! she walks toward her home burning everything within a certain radius of her powers when she reaches home her mother tries to kill her telling her that she is the spawn of satan she eventually uses her powers to stop her mothers' heart beat killing her eventually \( this is the good part of the book \) while carrie is walking on the streets \( going i do n't know where \) she seens chris and chris 's boyfriend driving towards her to bounce her carrie uses her powers to diverge to car killing chris and her stupid boyfriend sue eventually catches up with carrie carrie does n't kill her because she realizes that it was n't sue 's falt but chris 's \( during the battle with her mother carrie was stabbed i forgot to mention it sorry \) so now talking with sue carrie eventually breathes her last breath and speaks her last words and just dies \( this is the sad part i guarantee you that it would bring tears to your eyes or maybe not \) but this book is definitely good i recommend it with all my psychic powers enjoy this review was written by nigel	3
0	nice look good feel turns on fast takes great pictures really great with ridiculous depth of field and resolution you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the lcd back which is huge so what 's my beef \? slow pictures double flash slow slow follow on shot slow okay say cheese one second two seconds i only got thiis camera because i thought that problem was solved yes my battery is charged no i do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye \? slow i hate it ! ! ! ! ! ! still its awsome slick and a fair price	3
0	i had a feeling that this toy would be trouble when i saw the delivery guy walking up to our front steps with a weird grin on his face evidently the box had been vrooming vibrating and shrieking throughout his rounds and he was only too glad to end his term as its temporary steward my two year old has largely lost interest in this toy he does n't mind the shaking and noise but more often than not it just vrooms and then does n't go anywhere my advice buy matchbox or hot wheels or something more reliable with volume control this will probably be in our next load of donations thrift shoppers beware	3
0	i tried this product because i had been using arthred g powder which was discontinued this product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that i could not finish drinking it it tasted and smelled rather like soap if you used arthred g you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage there is no comparison here ! ! ! i would totally avoid this product	3
1	i have very fond memories of this short lived irwin allen classic the picture and sound on the dvd 's is better than i remember the video transfer is very nice and the sound is crisp albeit in mono i give volume one of the time tunnel five stars for pure television enjoyment volume one contains the first 15 episodes of the show the unaired extended version of the pilot irwin allen 's behind the scenes home movies visual effects camera test still galleries and promotional tv and radio spots once again it is lacking in cast interviews many of the actors from this show are still alive so why did n't the studio interview them for the dvd set \? it would be a welcomed addition to any release to see the actors today and get their thought 's on the show my only gripe is that this show only ran for one season so why split it into two volumes \? surely the studio could have compiled all 30 episodes into one boxed set at a reasonable price	3

1	had mine for over half a year now and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day i bought it i fill it and empty it every month rarely ever defragging it back up my pc files and play movies right off it on my laptop throw it in my backpack plug and unplug it all day \( hotswaping \) still with rarely a sign of slowdown and it barely gets from cool to warm ever \( even when its running from inside my backpack \) for some reason requires two usb ports on my new pc \( high speed usb2 0 ports \) when it should n't it runs on one port at school just fine and i have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50 success i 'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if i ever thought the one i have would run itself out the fact that it does n't need an external ac adapter to run on my usb1 1 laptop ports \( though it does have a hole for a non included ac adapter \) is a blessing i 've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd rom drive \( my cd rom ac doesnt work on both sadly \) might be luck of the draw hd related items seem to be sometimes and i 've yet to have to try out their customer service but overall worth every cent spent \( especially since i was looking at a 4gb external for 40 before i saw this \) nearly 1 a gig is a great deal	3
0	you get a view into 60 's white america the only people of color in this book are a policeman and a caricature i do n't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe this is set in everyday life and i think its best left on the bookshelf it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair not to mention various shades of skin colour the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one dimensional quot white quot depiction of the world	3

0	as a certified information systems security professional i can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever i got this book based on the glowing reviews i found here and i'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it the most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle an integrated approach to security in the organization the book not only lacks effective security integration techniques it does n't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half hearted integration	3

0	clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is an endorsement of ethnic cleansing if the tables were turned and a jew or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s t i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth ! !	3

1	this game is great both the missions and the things you do on your own \( like extortion \) make this game an awesome part of anyone 's collection i only found one thing wrong with the game when you reach the rank of don everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel for instance when talking to one of the corleone men they will still say something like hey kid stay outta trouble this game although great can still use a little fine tuning	3

0	i have friends who might be into this stuff if only because they like the old and the strange me i'm just like is this it 's a wonderful life \? i think i might have enjoyed this more if it was a novel or maybe if i picked up the script as it is this just barely seems to translate into a movie and forgive me for i have my own opinion city of angels was a good movie too bad if you do n't like all this contemporary nonsense i feel like it worked my opinion it 's long it 's boring it 's hard to hear even if it has a message i just ca n't relate to it so maybe that 's my problem your opinion your own keep it you 're lucky i gave it two stars	3

0	this review is in reference to nancy drew last train to blue moon canyon game strategy guide edition i 've played 3 or 4 of the drew games this one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game before i had installed 'blue moon canyon' i had installed morrowind the game of the year edition which sold for five dollars less than 'blue moon canyon' morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has at the bare minimum 400 hours of gameplay and possibly might literally be endless the entire morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15 20 minutes after i had installed and played 'blue moon canyon' we installed and got up and running age of mythology gold also within 20 minutes this is another massive game a real time strategy game that included the expansion pack the titans both 'mythology' games were completely installed this is another game that can be played and explored for years the two game set sold for five dollars more than 'blue moon canyon' or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition the last train to blue moon canyon took so long to download we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone we have a p4 at 3 2ghz an 80gb hd of which only 23gb were used and 1 5 gb of ram there is no reason on earth why nancy drew games should take so long over an hour to download unless their copy protection program conflicted with our toshiba super multi drive drivers the actual installation was not as painful as the download what was painful was the gameplay i had a lot of fun playing the 'secret of the old clock' whereas most of the amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game i liked playing the golf game and the car chase and the bank shots of reflective light beams to be aligned i even felt proud when i finally got the sewing completed i knew that the drew games would n't deliver the value that the two games \( mentioned above \) did but after the reading the reviews of 'blue moon' i expected to have more fun than i did with 'secret' even though i knew it would be short lived what a let down the game was over in two or three hours most of the gameplay was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over or which way the track leaned to the 'arcade' games in the general store were just hit the button or in this case 'click the mouse' you did n't even have to look the most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing it was very boring between the price the concern over the length of the download the most unimaginative gameplay set to walking back and forth on a train i cannot recommend this game as being fun it had a few moments with the math scale problems but it was n't enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to i realize i'm an adult but the eight year old little girl \( i bought it for \) lost interest after the first 15 minutes she was wiser than i sorry nance this one is a waste of money and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts marf	3

1	this can be used in lieu of a replacement battery plus if an electrical outlet is convienent like when shooting inside you never have to worry about running out of power also handy if you are mobile and have a auto dc ac converter but not as overall convienent as an extra battery i thought it would also trickle recharge the battery but it does n't nikon should add this feature in	3
0	bernard hermman 's score is magnificent this was a major let down for me considering it was directed by truffaut lacked any real suspense and edge boring camera work for the most part some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster the acting was fine i guess it was just a pointless story i felt that really did n't go anywhere and what was with that crummy ending	3
0	if you are looking for boring lifeless adult contemporary music then this cd is for you if you are looking for a great guitar cd this is n't it i had such high hopes for this cd after the robert johnson cds and the cream reunion but all winning streaks must come to an end and clapton 's comes to a screeching halt with this of all the eric clapton cds that i like this is n't one of them i'm glad clapton is now in a happy place \( and deservedly so \) but this cd just does n't do it for me	3

1	this chair is larger than some of the seats out there and fits my average sized 2 1 2 year old boy very well some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats ! the seat is shaped just right for splashes and it seems comfortable now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day we 'd be in business ! i love the simple design my son loves the color \( he picked it out himself \) and it 's so simple to clean it also has grips on the bottom so that it wo n't slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it a must	3

1	the sugar was perfect i ordered it to go on a cookie i make only at christmas time the cookie is an almond flavored one that you make by chiliing the dough and then cutting off a small piece which you make into a ball and then roll by hand out so it is about 9 inches long you try to keept it a little thicker in the very middle so when you twist it it has a tapered look you leave the top with a small opening so you can put a pretty ribbon thru it like it can be hung on the tree when they are cooked and still warm you put a thin coating on them of powdered sugar and almond flavoring and water and when they are still sticky you sprinkle the sugar on they came out beautiful i then put them in an old cookie tin and serve them up to company they think i am soooooo talented and it is so easy	3

1	this philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne i 've tried just about everything out there prescription topicals pills pro activ and all the over the counter stuff i have adult acne i never experienced acne as a teenager when i first started using philosophy 's kit i did n't notice a huge change in the first few weeks beyond pimples clearing up faster around week 5 or 6 i began to notice that i was n't waking up to a new zit every morning and i did n't feel oily at the end of the day now i have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person i do n't have to cover my face with concealer or retouch make up throughout the day i can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years ! i would recommend this kit to anyone who ca n't use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market	3

1	we got this chair as a baby shower gift which i registered for and absolutely love it ! i do n't understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about if used properly this chair gives absolutely no problems the seat locks in at different levels if it 's not locked in of course it will fall apart the seat is easy to use folds easily and cleans easily we store it in our van \( we have stow and go storage \) and it fits perfectly ! we 've used it since my son now 16 months could sit up he lays his body from side to side and the seat does n't budge very safe the tray does snap off easily and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it this does n't bother me since it 's not a 'toy' and should n't be climbed on anyway the tray has n't snapped off while in use and hopefully wo n't ! we 've used this chair on both a chair and the floor when seating was limited \( like at family get togethers \) we have n't had any problems at all anyway i highly recommend it	3
1	i got this game for my kids one is 11 and one is 9 they love it they can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it like baseball soccer boxing etc hey this even come with the camera i rated 4 stars because of the graffics they are not the best but still acceptible hope this review helps	3
1	i love this movie ! ! i remember the first time i saw it i was about 6 7 yrs old on a plane on my way to puerto rico eighteen \( or so \) years later i bought it watched it with my family it brought back so many great memories we loved it all over again i love the music the dancing the actors actresses the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it is an 80 's movie ! we all know how 80 's dance movies have the bad fame of neing corny ! i have to admit it did have some corny and bad acting moments but all in all i think this is an amewome movie i love it recommend it	3
1	this is a great toy for kids of any age we bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1 2 she still plays with it it folds up very nicely and no matter how many times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside it still looks like new at my son 's 6th birthday party \( 13 boys 2 girls \) the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an alien worm while the other kids beat them with blow up swords yes i was supervising but the tunnel took the beating and is still in great shape even out cats crawl through it there are not many toys that are this much fun and durable	3
0	pros very cool toy model for a 12 with extra time on their hands cons too many microscopic pieces to count very little room for open play requires extreme caution playing with it because the propeller and other pieces fall apart at the slightest breath not appropriate for under 7 at least first just let me say that my son loves the lego duplo blocks and spends hours creating all kinds of different designs with them he has been begging for the big boy legos and i have been turning him down pointing out the recommended ages on the box \( knowing that i would be picking up infinite numbers of tiny pieces throughout the house for the next 18 years \) the ages they put on the box seem to be purely arbitrary based on this particular toy a well meaning relative decided to bless him with this present on his 5th birthday \( i will be seeking revenge as soon as they have children \) i spent the next several hours constructing this nightmare which in and of itself defeats the purpose of a building toy in my opinion i have no idea where they have the idea that this is appropriate for a 5 year old given that it was a challenge for me to put this together given the amount of microscopic pieces in this toy one has to wonder who designs these things and if they have children of their own so much of it seems purely sadistic when the helicopter was finally assembled \( and i warned him that that was the one and only time i was putting it together \) my son spent some time playing with it only to be constantly frustrated by the fact that pieces were constantly popping off particularly the propeller and this was with very gentle play bottom line if you have a child under 10 they would probably have many more hours of play if you just bought a lot of inexpensively priced lego blocks \( of various types \) that they could make into all kinds of different designs these expensively priced city lines and the like are really neat once built but then it 's just like a very fragile model once you 've spent the time constructing it you really do n't want to take it apart so i'm not really sure why you would buy this over a traditional model i guess i miss the point	3
0	i have found that the ms 5700 to be very loud the braun 8995 that i replaced it with is very quiet the plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel and look it makes it hard to hold onto i have found that the shaver dos n't give me a very close shave compared to the braun 8985 shaver the solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace as you have read i have replaced the ms 5700 already with the braun 8985 and am very happy with the change the braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner	3

0	i bought this to replace a c strobe light i used as a tail light on my bicycle the c strobe was bright flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain and waterproof just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack this one was by the same manufacturer with strobe action and 1 3 the cost it does n't flash the strobe action is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light it is n't anywhere near as bright as the c strobe i'm going to get a c strobe later this month from a local boating dealer	3

1	this is an adorable movie it 's low budget and the acting is notspectacular but nevertheless it 's a cute story with sexy characters and an impressive unique plot conrad is a successful attractive man recently heart broken venturing into the unknown he hires a sex worker for the night as it turns out his hired man ian is quite the catch a young charming sexy australian trying to save money to stay in the country soon enough ian is in conrad 's life every day though not as you may think as ian moves into conrad 's social life everyone 's issues come to the surface love stories unfold and redevelop problems at home collide with life at work the truth behind ian 's need to do sex work comes out and everyone is in for a wake up call about life and what they need basically it 's genuine it 's cute and charming and it deals with real life problems most of which just happen to be gay a definite plus in my book so give its budget a break and sit back and enjoy a film well worth seeing	3

1	i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises but it works nonetheless and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections but i suspect it 's related to where i have things in the house no so much the product in fact i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine it 's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed ca n't complain especially for the price	3

1	the theory behind this important collection of essays is that quot the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms quot these essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well each essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and thirteenth century europe at issue in each are the questions of what or who held the power to command or punish and how that power was obtained kept and manifested this is a truly enlightening book of particular interest are the essays on holding power over the truth as well as those dealing the formation of the nobility into a self consciously chivalric warrior class however all the essays are intelligent and useful explorations into the very nature and meaning of power ultimately this book must be considered essential for any serious student of history casual or academic	3
0	this is n't funny it is n't well directed or scripted perhaps it could have been great if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director but it did n't so it turned out mediocre at best unfortunately i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i 'd read this was going to be a brilliant hilarious cult classic but now that we 've watched it he and i both know better we know it 's dreadful and i can only imagine all the nice things i'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we 'd seen one of the actors in the movie before i'm pleased to say i won the argument that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me in my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic' as others so often describe it i do n't know how drunk i 'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie or to find it even a little bit funny but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i 'd need a stomach pump afterwards if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci fi classic pick up a copy of flash gordon that has great actors great sets wonderfully campy scripts brilliant humour and a soundtrack by queen furthermore it has stood the test of time and is still great today unlike 'the ice pirates' which has dated really badly better yet get hold of some 'red dwarf' dvds seriously red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it 's so good it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies	3
0	i bought this because raquel welch was in it she did a good job but it 's not worth it i loss interest as sonn as i heard the guy talking about the people in the movie this dvd was dated back to the 1920s and how a movie star struggles to get his life back	3
1	i have been a subscriber for some time it 's a business publication that does not focus solely on wall street financials they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for think entrepreneur or general business topics and that 's business 2 0 it does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree think `oddball' as well monthly sections include `what 's next' `what works' `what 's cool' the articles are cutting edge in some cases well researched and well written with an informal slant they cover tech marketing product development product design ideas new products and services m a 's and a wide range of general business topics you will find out about new things before most of your coworkers giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler happy hour settings to go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market s the ads include autos like camry land rover lr3 mini cooper and even the porsche boxster laptops business productivity software like office 2003 business products like copiers and printers mobile calling plans hp credit cards and even lufthansa airline so if you are not in this demographic maybe they 're not targeting your demographic why buy you are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation' of your career you are entrepreneurial minded you want to keep on top of a wide range of business topics and even some that are not yet making the news as a gift for someone with these interests	3

1	i have long thick wavy hair that loves to frizz up i have tried every anti frizz hairstyling product out there and they either did n't work or weighed my hair down i did n't want to like this hair dryer and was hoping it would n't live up to the hype but it 's excellent on my hair after using the dryer \( with no styling product \) my hair was straight shiny and felt great for me it did n't change the amount of time i dried my hair so if your considering buying it for speed do n't unless you have thin or short hair is it worth the 200 00 price tag \? depends on you personally but i recommend you shop around because there are better deals out there	3

0	as a lecturer of e commerce i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted	3

1	this retelling of the snow white and the seven dwarfs was actually based on a script that billy wilder wrote before immigrating to the united states from germany but it was only after the success of the disney version that a demand was created for it the enormously versatile howard hawks \( quite literally the most versatile director in film history the only director to have mastered and or created five or six genres \) took the script and turned it into one of the last great pre ww ii comedies the story is simple a group of monkish scholars living together in new york city are writing an encyclopedia one of them is writing about slang but being unfamiliar with contemporary argot begins research his topic by talking to people outside his normal range of acquaintance he runs into gangster moll sugarpuss o'shea who takes advantage of the scholars to move in with them in order to escape the police who want to talk to her to implicate her guy joe lilac while hardly snow white she certainly managed to stir up their lives the film is made wonderful by a number of things wilder 's clever script hawks typically deft direction a solid performance by gary cooper but most of all by a scintillating job by the overwhelmingly alluring barbara stanwyck and a stellar collection of veteran character actors playing the seven dwarves all the latter are great but special mention has to be made of richard haydn \( who excells even beside the others with his extraordinary overpronounciation of everyday words \) oskar homolka and s z sakall there are few more delightful collections of character actors in any hollywood comedy i personally prefer barbara stanwyck to any other actress in hollywood history she possessed an emotional immediacy that no other actress could approximate and while her skills were perhaps a tad below those of someone like katherine hepburn the latter never managed to match her fire and passion and she is so sexy ! i grew up watching stanwyck on the big valley so when i first started seeing her great roles from the thirties forties and fifties i was absolutely stunned at how sexy she could be she was attractive yes but sexier than she was attractive and she was never sexier than she was here with the exception of her role the same year in the lady eve another reason to see this film is the appearance of gene krupa in the early nightclub sequence krupa had of course been with benny goodman throughout the thirties so this was very early in his career as leader of his own band	3

0	the setting of this book is beautiful exotic and interesting the author unfortunately does nothing to take advantage of this i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year which i doubt the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else as far as i am concerned i ca n't imagine it being done worse ! tuck 's writing style short vignettes or episodes one after another is terribly ineffective and disjointed i felt completely detached from all of the characters i did n't feel like i gained any understanding of who they were and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies another thing that completely irritated me were tuck 's sexual references throughout the novel tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter \( a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest for example \) these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader all they did was gross me out they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story i do n't know what tuck was trying to do in this novel i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level it is not entertaining it is not profound it is not educational it is not beautiful at only 248 pages i ca n't say it was even a quick read utterly forgettable once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it	3

0	we expose our babies toddlers to a wide variety of cultural sources in several languages therefore having seen similar products it seemed logical to purchase this one given it is touted as a multilingual introduction to their environment \( our little ones are trilingual english spanish and asl and they ignore us in all them ! \) big mistake the video not only reinforces but solidifies the sexist portrayal of love so prevalent in other baby einstein \( be \) items in earlier be products one could see only female hands manipulating objects as they presented them on screen male hands were never present this video goes many steps furhter by featuring male figures only in the background or at best an elderly man briefly interacting with a child everywhere else you see multiple females lovingly playing caring or otherwise being nurturing to children males are only seen \( with the exception of a black couple in bed while kids jump to play with them \) in a distant background in entirely detached attitudes or at least distant dry and quiet poses such as talking with a much older \( male \) child it is as if they are shown there as part of the domestic landscape however as movable and inane as potted plants whom you can move and place at will i felt insulted by this condescending and disqualifying view of male love and nurturing abilities asides when you go into the spanish version it is \( for a professionally produced video \) riddled with mistakes three objects are mislabeled in the first when a cup the plastic or paper tall type not the coffee and saucer version it is called la taza when in reality it should be el vaso as unlike english where it is interchangeable vaso is the specific word for that item the second much worse instance still in the kitchen was to introduce a bowl there the clueless scripter translated it as el bol a clear and poor corruption of the english word into a one commonly used in spanglish instead of calling it tazo'n as its correct name is the last one i saw was in the yard \( i'm suprised they did n't call it la yarda ! looka mami ! get la troca and go a la marketa a buy a boncha de carrotas ! \) this time they called an obvious swing \( two ropes and a seat in between \) la hamaca when in reality hamaca means hammock fortunately we are native speakers amnd are abel to catch these pitfalls but many people relies upon these products to teach their kids other languages in sum i was discusted with the whole thing	3
1	i think it very well could be so i'm not going to differ with those who say it is i bought this to use with a new 5d and itt 's simply outstanding in every regard so far i 've kept it on the 5d and ca n't bring myself to take it off i considered a couple of lenses including the is 24 105 f 4 which has a lot of appeal and the price is about the same but this was the lens i chose in part because i already have a the 70 300mm f 4 5 5 6 do is lens and the overlap seemed a waste while the extra stop helps i have no regrets about it sharp as a tack and quick i note that this is not compact lens especially with the hood on and it can stretch out a lot when you widen the field it is also not light this lens and the 5d will give your neck and back a pain assuming you work with more than one camera but the focal lengths covered are just about ideal and require none of the compromises that a longer zoom range require for that i 've got an 18 200 on a 20d the 70 300 do while not an l specs out in that range and has the virtue of real compactness but it' not a lightweight these two lenses cover just about everything for me and i can keep the 10 22mm on the 20d for the extra wide shots since writing the initial review i 've since traveled for several weeks with this lens and it fully lived up to expectations given the difficulties of travel these days i am concerned about the problem of not being able to carry it with me not a problem to date except for britain but always possible and despite the weight i might favor the 70 200 f 2 8l is usm as a second travel lens i like the brightness of the focus one suggestion there 's a temptation to use this lens wide open a lot of the time it 's very good and sometimes that 's the best thing but i 've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down a good deal for short night time exposures on a tripod and a remote release the effect with lights etc is considerably different along with the extended depth of field	3

1	it all started with john malkovich me seeing the movie i mean not the film itself i was scanning through malkovich 's filmography and saw this film in their i had heard of the film but had no idea what it was about but i checked it out malkovich is close to top billing but his role is really small having said that this was an amazing film truly a work of art the movie stars sam waterston \( 'serial mom' \) playing sydney schanberg a new york times columnist who heads to cambodia on the brink of war bombs have been dropped labor camps have been set up and schanberg wants to write about all of it when he gets there he meets dith pran \( haing s ngor who won an oscar for the role \) who becomes his friend and interpreter malkovich plays schanberg 's photographer al rockoff his role is brief but he leaves his mark after schanberg 's war entraps himself and his fellow journalists pran saves him from being executed but is himself placed in a labor camp the script is based on a new york times article by schanberg called the death and life of dith pran when i saw that i figured this would be a rather depressing story truth is the film is quite uplifting the choice to use john lennon 's imagine for the final scene was perfect anyway back to the synopsis schanberg is back in new york while pran slaves at the labor camp schanberg has no idea whether pran is alive or dead but does n't give up on the idea of one day reuniting with his friend most films that take place in this setting i'm not a big fan of i'm not saying i did n't like these films but movies like the constant gardener and beyond borders are a bit like this movie although for the record this film is way better having said those last two things i was surprised that i liked this film whether you 're a fan of these kinds of movies or not you need to see this it 's an important and uplifting movie that no one should not see grade a	3

1	yes the beatles by which i'm not comparing supergrass to them no supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles but other british rock'n'roll greats like the kinks david bowie the zombies and many others but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000 's this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rock'n'roll of the 1990 's and 2000 's and without doubt represent the bohemia intellectual hard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circa sgt pepper an intoxicating and highly addictive album 100 recommended for anyone any age	3

0	i would n't describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered it 's not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack the best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein still it had a fairly short shelf life for jerky the unopened tubes had gone bad \( mold \? or something \? ick \) within about 3 months	3
1	that 's the day that the first wiffle balls \( invented a year earlier \) went on sale in this baseball crazy country mr david mullany created the first wiffle ball in fairfield connecticut after seeing his 12 year old son struggling to throw a curveball mr mullany \( to whom we bow down and show obeisance \) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the wiffle ball an american institution was born oh wiffle ball wiffle ball it nearly compels me to wax poetic i'm now 46 years old but the love that i have for the game of wiffle ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch ! my brother and i were born to a beautiful baseball loving woman shirley grew up following the cincinnati reds and as a child she acquired a nickname based on a long forgotten big league pitcher as an adult she worked for the los angeles dodgers and the los angeles angels \( that was before they became the california angels and then the anaheim angels and then the los angeles angels of anaheim and then the chicago white sox victims \) she instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for america 's pastime \( in fact my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys little league team \) but when we were n't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys and when we could n't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of over the line at the park my brother doug and i were battling it out in a game of wiffle ball in the yard we had some outrageously competitive games in our glory days we perfected the art of pitching a wiffle ball and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us i remember 1990 and a young athletic college student who claiming to have played wiffle ball throughout his childhood challenged this old geezer on the ucla field behind the john wooden center well my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times he just shook his head and i concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child it wasn't what my brother and i called wiffle ball if you have never owned a wiffle ball you 've never really been alive my dear friend ! although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time \( especially if you hang too many curveballs for my brother who swings with great authority \) they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise ! they can be used anywhere outdoors because the wiffle ball weighs only two thirds of an ounce and if doug never knocked one through a window neither will you ! and although the wiffle ball is light it does not follow that it should be taken lightly after san francisco giant \( man do i hate the giants ! \) kevin mitchell won the 1989 national league mvp award he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of wiffle ball the previous off season one of the greatest hitters of all time san diego padre tony gwynn used to hit wiffle balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball play with a wiffle ball and you 're in big league company ! the wiffle balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety \( and surprise ! they 're still made in the u s a the day production moves to communist china i 'll jump \) twelve wiffle balls are currently going for 14 95 that 's only 1 25 per ball do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a wiffle ball \? well take my word for it you 'll get more than a dollar and twenty five cents worth ! now all you need to do is get the regulation old school plastic yellow \( banana \) bat of course if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum wiffle ball bat funny story my dear ol' ma bought an aluminum wiffle ball bat as a gift for my brother on his birthday but she was n't sure what size to get so she called the company how old is your son \? the representative asked when she said 41 he laughed loud and said i think you 'll want to go with the heaviest model one of the great disappointments in my life \( seriously ! \) is that they did n't think to organize wiffle ball competitions until doug and i were in our 40 's we scouted out the competition at the wiffle ball world series here in phoenix a few years ago \( players fly in from all over the country ! \) we figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more if we polished our long neglected technique over the next year alas it never happened what with work and life and all the other crap that gets in the way of wiffle ball play but that does n't mean you ca n't fly into phoenix next year and win the title ! get to it man ! get yourself a dozen wiffle balls a banana bat and start practicing hint the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half want to throw a drop \? make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point then get inventive there are innumerable variations on that theme ! you can thank me for the hint when you see me you 'll recognize me because i'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it !	3

0	i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality perhaps worth the price to some but i 'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness most ionic and infrared is gibberish tourmaline a gemstone has electrical properties \( when squeezed or heated it develops a charge across the crystal \) but that has nothing to do with hair drying or ionizing air or anything else i 'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam	3

1	this memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced i did n't have to worry about this because mine came with my ps2 it can hold about 40 files thats about 1 file for each game if you have over 40 games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards if you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused the value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng	3

0	this is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author the book is poorly researched poorly written and well words just fail me while i am not a great herriot fan i do have to give him his due the man could write well and could tell a good story \( is n't that what authors are suppose to do \? \) but this guy graham lord i suspect has problems feeding paper into his typewriter ! the intire book is such an obvious ploy to make some money on the shirttail of a quot dead quot and popular author it is rather nauseating shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work ! i did finish the book though \( thank god i did not purchase the thing \) because each page became worse and worse and i could not stop thinking with each turn of the page quot well it just cannot be any worse than that last page chapter quot how wrong i was ! if you must read the thing borrow it or check it out of a library i would hate to see a person waste their money and i certainly would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this herriot 's life warts and all could be such a fastinating subject i do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually we certainly did not get it here	3

1	i got this movie in a three dvd pack from a local dealer it came along with the movies eaten alive and massacre in dinosaur valley i 'd have to say that all three movies were worth the 15 dollars i spent on the three pack the movie jungle holocaust is an adventure movie in a different spin i dont really consider this a horror movie at least in the conventional sense the movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography the storyline is interesting and the acting and er scenes are engrossing \( to use a phrase \) what i would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings communications are not what you would get off the local street corner worldviews are nonexistent \( at least to the tribe in this film \) so there is no connection except savagery maybe this movie would have a greater tie with golding 's lord of the flies a fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we especially in first world countries like the us have forgotten about i would suggest end of the spear as a christian look at examining these prehistoric people that film is n't a horror film it is a christian film but it is \( as i am a christian \) an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory	3

0	as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway 's latest offering let me first say that i am a fan of this group which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom but what i heard was bluegrass muzak yes the group 's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing gospel music even bluegrass gospel has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous some serious and contemplative some that push the envelope of orthodoxy and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new or buy used want mine	3

1	i inhaled this cd after all the hype and hyper blowin' up about this dance punk rock genius i finally broke down and bought it not that i was old enough to get into the discos in the mid 70 's early mid 80 's \( i was still in elementary school then middle school \) but i remember \( and still love \) the groups that influenced this disc the buzzcocks heaven 17 pil blondie hell even the rolling stones some girls album and yes i have to say \( after finding death disco songs under the dance floor 1978 1984 cd and i'm ordering it \) the old stuff is more fun but for the hipsters who do n't know this is not original genre it 's pretty great no it 's very great the first song daft punk is playing at my house was fun and both discs made it worth driving through snowy sleety frozen rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple weeks	3

0	this second part of xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part regardless of what anyone says i no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes the game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non intuitive battle system annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy including the very first one battle result and saving screens are a painful chore battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets the game has very few items weapons or armor to deal with even ordinary enemies which are stronger than expected the skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy battles with main enemies are long which is n't such a problem however they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle just to frustratingly finish off a battle weakened party voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying i do n't remember any music from this game so plain it is some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first xenosaga very noticeable is the use of swearing which is the main reason i do n't enjoy or watch hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore new meaningless characters have been introduced into the story and the focus shifted far away from the main characters the cover character hardly says or does anything this time there is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment but if you blink you will miss it this game is far more frustrating than challenging which is not a good game trait i do n't recommend even playing this game before reading the above to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits if you 're looking forward to anything that made the first xenosaga great you will be extremely disappointed the second xenosaga is better completely avoided	3

0	noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his yours and mine the united states of america he has made millions of dollars teaching lecturing selling his books and investing his world wide fame in psycholinguistics is well deserved his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u s in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism when he always ranks the u s and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now and even in history his distrust of any authority benign or otherwise is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the underdog even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah yet since 1955 hypocrite chomsky has worked for the overdog massachusetts institute of technology which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction and continues to this very day chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money earning the adulation of the american left and freedom to express himself he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea iran or syria let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much the united states of america god bless america which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak teach and make lots of money raybo	3

1	i bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back i am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors after hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here 's the lowdown pros picture quality is amazing even after zooming the full 10x \( i never go into digital zoom because of low quality of pictures although this camera is n't too bad after complete full optical and digital zoom \) prints that i 've made up to 16x20 \( have n't gone larger but i know i can \) are extremely impressive and are as crisp as viewing a 4x6 it is easy to use and the functions are easy to get to with the use of the joystick the stabilization at full 10x zoom is incredible also it appears really shaky through the window but pictures continue to turn out crisp close ups are clear and reveal amazingly clear details the movie feature works better indoors than the regular camera portion \( read cons \) cons indoor shooting is limited because the flash is n't strong enough when at a school chorus concert the pictures turned out fuzzy and unclear award ceremonies the pictures turned out once again unusable in my standards the zoom is fixed when using the movie feature so you need to have the zoom set before beginning a movie this camera seems to eat batteries especially in the winter months i am always on the go and when i go to pull out the camera i find the camera lens cover has fallen off yet again it comes off way to easily causing smudges and smears on the lens so i must always have lens cleaner wipes on me the viewing window cover has also come off and is lost in the woods somewhere but that also is minor most of the cons really are all minor things that do n't interfere with the amazing quality of the pictures as long as you are properly prepared for those minor issues i tried to be as precise about this camera as possible all in all i would highly recommend this camera to the avid photographer if you plan on using a camera on mostly indoor activities just keep in mind for the flash to work good keep your subjects close it 's been bumped jostled and droped a couple of times and the camera still works like a gem	3

0	we bought this camera thinking that it would be our do all eurocam for an upcoming trip to europe it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip sadly the camera is not up to filling this role we will need to take another camera along with it however we will take the v705 for its wide angle lens the reason that we picked this model in the first place it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review the need for a true wide angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera if you do not need a 23mm lens or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p s \( point and shoot \) camera good fairly decent 23mm wide angle lens the 23mm is the default lens rapid start up time internal focus and zoom chromatic aberration well controlled can use 4gb cards freeze frame and extract any video frame mediocre soft images perceptible shutter lag slow shot to shot times exposure compensation is easy but steps are too small for digital and is reset when camera turned off flash does not come close to covering the 23mm image numbering basically limited to 4 digits flimsy construction no manual controls no raw format no optical viewfinder histogram on display but too small to be useful bad the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery unacceptable visual noise starting at asa 400 forced in camera stitching of panoramic images with inability to save the individual panoramic shots panoramic component images forced to 5mp overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image \( even with display on `bright' \) mpeg 4 video compression gives very poor results synopsis if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot this and the older v570 are the only choices if most of your images are in bright light the 7mp v705 gives better images if most images will be in low light the older cheaper 5mp v570 is the better choice the camera seems very fragile treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide angle performance if you chose this as your sole camera you will likely be unhappy with your choice the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide angle lens some expanded comments twenty three mm wide angle fixed focus lens this lens has almost decent optical quality though the camera 's processing still produces overly compressed and soft images from it on power up the 23mm is the initially active lens which is ideal for us however considering that this is truly a specialty lens it would make more sense that the `normal' lens should be the default best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot up lens better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens the camera does have firmware wide angle distortion correction this works fairly well at the cost of even more image softness but even so barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm film camera wide angle lenses of similar focal length this in camera correction can be turned off doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance however being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as manual settings a physically larger sensor chip raw image files or at least a choice of degree of jpeg compression at the other end of the camera 's focal length the 114 117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion there are very few circumstances where one would want to use `digital zoom' so as with all digicams the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus after reaching optical zoom limits one is much better off doing any further 'zooming' in an editing program kodak 's advertised 5x optical zoom is at best misleading actually it is just flat out untrue the camera has two lenses the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39 114mm lens which is not quite 3 1 the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length \( note in some places kodak claims 39 114 in others 39 117 optical zoom \) also misleading is the claimed anti blur technology as best i can tell from looking at the images and at the exif metadata all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera speaking of asa this is an opportune time to address the camera 's incredibly poor menu system it is byzantine being both awkward and time consuming to use to adduce `auto' asa ranges from 50 200 to set a faster \( or to lock in at a slower \) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels to change from `auto' to the next fastest \( 400 \) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control the menu system is next to unusable in the field still on asa settings the camera does have sensitivities up to asa iso 1000 \( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 1000 is available on the camera \) unless your shot is of a once in a lifetime will never happen again moment then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 the previous version of this camera v570 had only 5mp but the same sensor size by increasing the pixel count but not the physical size of the sensor the new v705 camera actually has more low light digital noise than its predecessor this has happened with many of the current p s cameras as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality my initial experience with low light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which when calibrated to the sensor in the camera allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise doing so does allow for semi adequate 8x10 prints at asa 800 if one really wants to get carried away combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography \( where dozens hundreds thousands of images are averaged together \) makes 8x10 's at asa 1000 doable people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak 's target market back to earth the v705 's still image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p s cameras mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression which is not adjustable \( e g `best' `good' etc \) my guess is that a compression setting of 30 40 is being used this results in small files with a lot of compression artifact the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1 2 1 5mb in size those from another 7mp p s i have are 5 6mb my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8 10mb the more the compression the worse the image most cameras allow the user to pick the trade off point kodak picks it for you and picks poorly the v705 's video performance is very disappointing it uses mpeg 4 compression and at very aggressive compression settings unless it is a video of your baby 's first steps or aliens landing in the backyard you will likely find it hard to watch the total output datastream is about 0 5 mbs compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs \( total adding sound error correction and time codes is 36 mbs \) better to have stuck with mpeg 2 which would give less compression but decent enough \( tv quality \) videos that is the choice that most manufactures have made as a result the videos from my other p ss have about a 2 mbs datastream and so are of much better quality the battery kodak 's claim is 150 still images per charge i am getting 100 120 with minimal use of flash and the lcd on `energy saver' even 150 would be poor compared with my other digital p ss where i expect at least 200 and often get 250 if i am at all careful with power management this camera has a proprietary \( and hard to remove \) 720 mah battery my \( several \) other p ss have 790 1120 mah batteries and i suspect more efficient processors since we are only going to be using this camera for wide angle the battery will likely last most of a day we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25 the cost of the camera though the body is of aluminum the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use there is no cover for the charge socket the media door often dislodges open truly my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the \( not included in this model \) easyshare dock system this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory and the overly aggressive jpeg compression shutter lag the b te noire of digital cameras is very evident with this model i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter and the image being recorded however based on over 50 years of tripping shutters it clearly varies and i estimate is at best 1 4 second up to a bit over 1 2 second in addition to the shutter lag there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment an active child at a particular instant or a wary animal almost impossible the shutter lag is much more evident than in same generation price p s cameras from other makers the accompanying `manual' is poorly organized childishly written finish reading this book so you can take and share your best pictures ! at best it was written for 8 year olds the manual does make reference to a web address where one can download the `full manual' however the address given is incorrect when eventually found the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level panoramics one of the advertising points of the camera are another disappointment basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in `panoramic mode' each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image in order to allow alignment as with most `panoramic modes' focus and exposure is locked on the first image so far this is all ok however it rapidly goes downhill first the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 \( not 7 \) mp next the image overlay is so dark that even with the lcd set at max brightness it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements however it gets worse the images must be joined in camera ! the individual images cannot be stored ! in camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1 5x2 lcd in the field gives in spite of the camera 's best efforts much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger and higher quality computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single stills making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light meter readings of course my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera so we will not be dragging it along you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved reading back through this review i see that it is mostly negative this makes sense for as i disclosed at the beginning it was my disappointment in this camera 's actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place likely i have said all that needs to be said so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide angle lens except for this unique lens the camera 's performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p s cameras currently on the market if you need a true wide angle p s you need this camera otherwise forget it	3

1	from what i gather edward abbey has somewhat of a cult following i had never read anything by the guy never even heard of him before i got this book i just thought i should point that out before going on this book kept me reading no doubt about that it has it 's downsides but overall i 'd reccomend it not hey you gotta read this right now but it 's good if you 're looking for something a little different this book kind of made me think i'm not the kind of guy who is always reading into a book trying to analyze every aspect of it but i could n't help it with this story i thought a lot of it was psychological dealing with the main character his thoughts attitudes and what made him tick this is a fairly long book but the actual story of the guy going back to his hometown is short the plot alternates every chapter one about where he presently is and then a memory then where he is then another memory and so on although it was an interesting way to write the book i thought some of the memory sequences dragged a bit but do n't get me wrong overall i did enjoy them if you 're looking for something that might be able to fuel a couple of thoughts about life this is a good bookt to pick up	3

1	187 is a strange movie about schools it 's strange because this is one of the few pictures that looks at a teacher 's perspective of the system and it 's strange because it 's not a rosy picture of schools jackson 's portrayal of trevor garfield paints a picture of a nervous worried teacher who was passionate about teaching but is now scared of the slightest sound continually checking the corner of his eye as he 's been faced with a near fatal attack a year earlier what the film is about is the various teachers' reactions to the students around them garfield wants to do good but has a past that is burning him up inside john heard 's character is a teacher who 's embittered by the students working to merely cash a paycheck while kelly rowan 's character means well but is scared and confides in jackson 's character because he is a survivor what i love about the film is that there is a realism in the way the teachers communicate with each other the good and the bad is here we get a picture of the various attitudes teachers have about their kids and how some events can make or break a teacher i also love how 187 explores the political and sometimes beuaracratic nature of the classrooms including the placement of students in a given classroom and how teachers can sometimes have their jobs put in jeopardy because of very rigid law clearly the writer scott yagemann who is a teacher himself feels the system has failed and has gotten in the way of a primary goal of teachers when they enter the profession a desire to teach the film is somewhat problematic with an over the top preachy and somewhat implausible conclusion but the writer wears his heart on his sleeve and the above all message about the passion being sucked out of teaching is clear for that reason it 's as powerful a movie as any about teaching even if it lacks the uplifting conclusion so many others offer	4

0	i really tried to like this game being that ea chickened out and bought their way out of competition the graphics and sound are great in this game but its ruined by ea 's cheating ai i have never seen a game cheat this much in my life no matter what play you call the defense always knows what you are calling even if you think you have them beat on a play your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his nitrous oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in 2 seconds to deflect a pass if you throw a high pass not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump 10 feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass if the cpu wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do if you qb is going back for a pass and a lineman is 3 feet away from you even if you press the passing button your qb will just stand there so he can take a sack this game is total bs there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure becuase the game forces you into a tackle animation when you are playing defense you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the cpu pulls of bs miracle plays on every single down remember how i said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes \? not the cpu receivers the cpu receivers regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time if they do n't catch it the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it think you stopped a 3rd down conversion \? think again you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penatly and remember about your qb being forced into a tackle animation \? not the cpu the cpu can get of 60 yard spirals while he 's being hit ! what about the inconsistency you ask \? well let me explain how is it that one game you can be totally on but the next game you ca n't even complete one pass ! i 'll tell you why the cpu wants you to lose so you will drop every pass fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book i was playing a game and managed to run back a punt and kr for a td before my offense even touched the field then all of a sudden the cpu turned on its god mode and every thing went right for the cpu bs lobs bs runs and bs calls i did not complete one single pass in the entire first half its not because the cpu was playing good defense its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them wide open or not i ended up only completing one pass in the entire game 1 for 20 i think at this point i knew i had no chance of winning so i just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration my so called impact rb only got 2 yards on 20 rushes and my so called impact cb gave up 3 td passes to a below average receiver what is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win \? yes you can win games as i have but it is so inconsistent if the cpu wants you to lose you will lose nothing you can do about it i see why ea bought the license after putting out crap like this they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better ai instead of this cheating crap i am taking this game to the store for store credit and i am done with ea for good ea sucks and so does this game	4
0	black hawk down has n't got an interesting story on offer when a bunch of marines is stranded in mogadishu somalia all hell breaks loose as militants start attacking them from there it is just angry men running and shooting although this is what you would expect from a war movie black hawk down remains way below average i think this movie could have done better with some obvious main characters now you barely get a chance to start caring about what happens to the soldiers now you have so many qualified actors doing nothing but firing guns as this movie was based on events that truly took place probably americans will appreciate black hawk down a little more \( sarr \)	4
1	i have been using this for my face for over 10 years it is very inexpensive \( especially compared to other cosmetic brands \) and cleans well without irritating or drying the skin i also used it on my 3 kids it comes in handy on the changing table especially when the wipes were not quite wet enough to do the job ! it is also great for any spot cleaning anywhere on the body without rinsing it can just be wiped off without leaving any residue it is very gentle even for newborn 's skin	4
1	love it ! fits the pad beautifully and seems to get softer everytime you wash it	4
1	i first encountered this film on bravo and after a few minutes i knew i had to buy the dvd \( simply because it was clear the our great country had grossly edited the film for a 1 00am showing \) cemetery man is one of those genre defying films that surprises at every turn it is amusing thought provoking and borrows inspiration from the surrealists \( in fact consider the scene where francesco and his love are passionately engaged under the sheet in the mausoleum this is actually inspired by magritte 's the lovers ii \) moreover strains of kubrick can be noted as francesco ventures on a killing spree to an die freude soavi aligns himself with the greats and proves that in many respects he belongs there not a mainstream fan this was my first experience with everett his acting was absolutely impeccable franceso 's ennui reflects our own ennui likewise fran ois hadji lazaro showcases his enormous range with his portrayal of gnaghi \( a seemingly simple minded idiot child who harbors a reserve brilliance \) the dynamic between these two actors is rare their exchanges are both humorous and tender the plot has been rehashed here over a hundred times so there is no need for me to elaborate simply allow me to say if you are looking for a zombie film similar to romero 's work do not bother you will be frustrated in many ways the zombies are incidental to this film they shamble around the edges but have no real role the actual story is one of desire \( and the inherent dangers of desire \) so if you have ifc blocked think bravo is too artsy or find sundance pretentious by all means do not try this film furthermore if the thought of voluntary male castration has you running for the hills visit a more pleasant page but if you are intellectually curious buy this film today five stars for superb acting gorgeous cinematography and unparalleled writing	4
1	overall i like it the best part is the flip up screen protector i have had 2 zire models and managed to break both screens my dislike is that i have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting i have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail as for the sd card issue i remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject to keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo i drilled a hole in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes	4

1	i bought my seven and ten year old daughters moon shoes for christmas i had read all the reviews so i immediately instructed the girls to always wear their bicycle helmets when playing with their moon shoes yes they can be dangerous but with a few precautions i think the kids will have more fun be safer and the parents will have peace of mind 1 do n't let the kids start jumping right away hold their hand or have them put their hand on your shoulder as they practice walking in them 2 once they 've achieved the ability to balance have them practice bouncing in place just a little bit this will help them learn to balance as they move and learn how the moon shoes respond to the way they move 3 set ground rules no bouncing when there is a lot of debris around no bouncing while holding objects always wear helmet no bouncing near each other and if you feel or hear any of the rubber bands break while bouncing sit down immediately and take off the shoes my kids spent the first half hour 45 minutes getting use to their moon shoes they now can bounce around with stability and confidence	4
1	i know who thinks of looking for anything special when replacing your wiper blades get the cheapest ones from the auto parts store and forget about it right \? well if you have to deal with even the smallest amount of ice or snow these blades are incredible they wipe clean and smooth every time and never clog up with ice or snow they sit low and tight on your windshield and do n't skip or chatter at highway \( or higher \) speeds while 20 bucks each may seem like a lot consider your safety in bad weather and how effectively these blades clean your windshield and you 'll thank yourself every time buy them through amazon as they 're the best deal around every auto parts store that had them wanted almost twice the price	4
1	these can definitely be a life saver during the first 1 2 weeks when you do n't want compression on the nipple and you want them to air dry i have small breasts so i could wear them in any bra and i did n't have a huge leakage problem so i changed the foam twice a day the only problem i had was that my skin broke out where the rubber rested against it i think it got damp and was n't allowed to breathe because it cleared up within 48 hours after i stopped using them bottom line the relief was worth any minor inconvenience	4

0	first let me say that i whole hearedly agree with the review by tiberius back in the glory days of counter strike \( 2001 2002 \) this game was the be all end all for 1 \) online video games 2 \) first person shooters 3 \) pc games and 4 \) any video game basically it had real life weapons the graphics were superb at the time the maps were extremely well made the system requirements are still obscenely low and damnit it was fun then inevitabely the hands of time began to take their ruthless indiscriminate toll video cards supported better graphics new \( and yes better ! \) games came out \( battlefield 1942 unreal tournament 2004 \) hacking became the unmistakable poison of counter strike and a lot of the cool casual gamers grew up or moved on from 2000 to 2004 counter strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance by 2004 to present day it has become a problem great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom 's worn out 640 megahertz pentium iii pcs running windows 98 counter strike is still one of the most popular games of all time with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day because people just do n't seem to have enough self control to give up their hopeless addiction today server admins are for the most part humorless dictators and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game 's undeniable monotonous drone people are still playing the same maps from the 1 0 release that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential it always feels as if i 've played the same round a thousand times before and i probably have even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony fy iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way and all look disguisting i 've played on probably over 500 servers and downloaded probably over the same amount of quality custom maps and not more than 3 have i ever seen a server run in its rotation or voted on by the players furthermore people are still playing the game using dial up and cs veterans are always complaining about camping even if its a tactic used to complete the objective as far as the objectives are concerned counter strike has basically become a deathmatch game no one will listen to anyone 's plan \( on the rare occasion there is one \) no one tries to rescue the hostages and everyone always calls someone a p y or nub if you use the auto shotgun or awp and to top it all off valve cancelled the outstanding won net and replaced it with this steam garbage a utility soaking wet with incompetence l337 speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded counter strike culture and has become its own incessant frustration but i wo n't even get into that if you 're new to cs do n't bother veterans of this game are far from friendly and you 'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you 're a beginner for now if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game check out world of warcraft battlefield 1942 sven co op or even team fortress classic \( a dated game with an awesome community that has yet to lose its initial charm \)	4
1	we finally broke down and spent the money on the jumperoo and were happy we did we have to limit the time our son spends in it because he 'd jump for hours on end if we did n't limit him to 5 10 minutes a day the jumperoo has sturdy construction and the 4 settings are useful i was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because i was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it but he 's been fine he does n't play with the toy attachment i think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	4

0	i 've seen the phrase slice of life used many times to describe this movie which makes me wonder whose life is this a slice of \? certainly not mine and not most people 's the anniversary party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain self absorbed jaded and rich beyond most people 's wildest fits of imagination worse there is n't much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people or at least most people who are fun to be around do n't act the way these characters do good films can be made about hollywood in mulholland drive it 's kind of a dream world both in the sense that it 's hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it in state and main the self absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement the anniversary party is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters but i ca n't imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who is n't also a bored rich prick if this is truly a slice of life for the hollywood set it is no wonder that so many films produced in hollywood are so cynical and shallow	4
0	i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard	4
1	i first saw this movie when i was a kid it left a good impression i am now nearly 50 and a cat came to live with me my first female cat i named it mewsette in honor of judy garland 's character in the movie i then searched for the movie on the internet found it bought it while it 's not as good as it was when i was a kid it is still amusing	4

0	i agree with most of the others it worked okay for a couple of months now not only does it not charge my phone but if i plug it into my phone it immediately loses all charge ! it 's also always falling out of the lighter plug i do n't have that problem with any of my other chargers and i carry three chargers with me for my different gadgets	4
1	i read desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with the regulators also this book is filled with suspense from page one the book never drags in my opinion this book though is not for the faint of heart if you do n't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter but if you do n't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes the ending is by far the most suspenseful part i also recommend reading desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what tak is all about the journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also i wish there was a part three to this but sadly there is n't i ca n't choose between desperation and regulators because their both great but the regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end keep up the good work king	4

0	i was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements i had nothing but high hopes i was totally open minded i thought it seemed too good to be true \( low cal no carb noodles ! \) but hey i'm an optimist guess what \? it is too good to be true ! i read about washing them and drying them i did no problem i added sauce i put them in my mouth the taste was not the problem it was the texture it was seriously like chewing rubber bands no noodle resemblence whatsoever i honestly ca n't understand those who rave about these but hey to each his own	4
0	in installed this product on a dell optiplex gx110 \( admittedly not the latest but still a very standard machine \) running windows 2000 with 512mb of memory in spite of spending literally hours with the software i was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls multiple emails to broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that i refer to their website for help this site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems \( like not being able to read the install cd \) it would also appear that this product is picky about the hardware it supports and also the version of driver be prepared for possible frustrations with this product with little support from the manufacturer i cannot report on other features of the software because i was never able to produce even the walls of a structure	4
0	this clarifying lotion is too harsh i used it once and my skin is itchy dry and red i think i'm allergic to it basically the chemicals in these products are really harmful most of the time people do n't need these products all they do is clog up what nature has given us this lotion is horrible	4
1	i read a few not so favorable reviews mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand \( which mine does not suffer \) but i decided to order it anyway figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand \( you can also wall mount it \) well it has paid off as the magnets work as promised the tines stay sealed tight and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices i pitched the included spices and filled it with my own as for labels there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices i honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack and it has worked beautifully	4

0	when i first picked up drinking coffee elsewhere i was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy and truthfully it 's not a horrible book it is entertaining the style works etc on that note if you 're looking for a fun read and do n't plan on thinking about it too much then by all means get it my problem with the book is that it does n't deserve all the acclaim it 's getting if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio political situation of america this is not your book probably one of the major problems with the collection is that it 's heralded as a riveting commentary on the plight of the african american female packer has very little new to say and most of the underlying themes of the stories have not only been said previously by alice walker and other writers but have also have been said better by those authors drinking coffee elsewhere is no more than a watered down version of you ca n't keep a good woman down a book that while having its own problems would probably be a better use of your time and money if you 're really interested in the social commentary in the text even from the literary standpoint it 's not terribly outstanding the characters are stereotypes the plots are predictable the adult female protagonists are all essentially the same person an intelligent outsider who struggles with race religion and fitting in and are generally pretty ornery about it as they do so the other protagonists are the same just not so irritable similar to this lack of variation in her characters packer varies little in her narrative style yes the language is pretty at times but there is no experimentation with language or structure all of the writing is in a highly generic voice finally the stories themselves contain scenes that are n't necessary and that detract from the actual narrative in short drinking coffee elsewhere proves that what it takes to sell a lot of books is n't actual talent but how much your publisher backs you packer had the good fortune to have famous mentors and to be the product of some highly acclaimed writing programs which resulted in her being picked up by a big name publisher who could pay to get her name out	4

0	this is not the best way to get started in astronomy the low power eyepiece is fairly useful the higher power one less so and do n't even think of using the barlow the maximum useful magnification for a 60mm scope is about 120 140x assuming the objective lens is of good quality when you use the middle and high magnifications provided with this scope you exceed that limit and the increased image size is more than offset by breakdown to their credit the manufacturer has provided a reflex red dot finder in place of the useless 5x24 finders that plague so many similar scopes even so what you can expect to see in this scope is rather limited some star clusters will be dimly visible but galaxies and nebulae will be barely if at all visible in a way it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope their upper tier instruments are quite good but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models just make sure gentle reader to stay away from the toys using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar it is a learned skill and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving if you want to see the wonders of the sky contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars \( decent ones are available on amazon \) then graduate to something along the lines of a 150 200mm \( 6 8 \) dobsonian celestron 's own 6 starhopper can be found on amazon for under 290 for more information on buying telescopes see my encyclopedic guide on amazon so you want to buy a telescope	4
0	i purchased through work the powershot s70 in july of 2005 i 've always owned nikon products personally but the features for the price of the s70 swayed me away from my usual nikon brand loyalty in the 12 months i 've had the s70 it 's been sent to the factory twice for repairs the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired the first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track eight months later the flash quit working in all modes and the door was failing again ! the flash and door problem occurred while i was in yosemite np so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning now the warranty is expired and i hold my breath every time i slide the lens door open i have no faith in the canon s70 and have lost a lot faith in canon products as a whole the only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within 2 3 weeks which i thought was fast for warranty work	4
1	being the first ravensburger puzzle i have ever owned it is without a doubt the best quality and the best detailed puzzle i have ever worked with the quality of the product is shown throughout from the sturdy container practically sediment free packaging the exact cuttings of the each puzzle piece \( not a single one was still attached to another puzzle piece and there were only one or two frayed cut spots in the whole set \) and the high quality graphic printing the puzzle itself is made difficult primarily by the use of similar colors throughout the puzzle pieces are otherwise the standard cut type the resulting artwork is something that we 've decided to actually frame and hang in my office which we have never done over the years \( puzzles can be very calming to work on after a long week of long and stressful work hours especially when working on them with others \) the puzzle cuts are so well done that it is not entirely easy for someone to tell that it is a puzzle from general glancing unless they get up close \( within 2 feet \) and look at the detail i will definitely buy more ravensburger puzzles and hope that they come out with even more puzzles of this type \( old world maps \) and same quality	4

0	we purchased this purcolator christmas 2003 and ended up returning the first one after it did not work out of the box amazon was great in sending us out another via exchange the second percolator worked however i wished i 'd have saved my money the coffee basket allowed too many coffee grounds to end up in the coffee do n't take that last cup you will also need a carafe to store the coffee in after percolating the percolator maintains the heat too high when ready and boils the coffee continuously mmmm burnt coffee !	4
0	for those not aware pumpkinhead 2 is \( supposedly \) the 1994 sequel to 1988 's timeless monster classic pumpkinhead the original was darkly creepy superbly constructed in it 's story and featured a wonderfully original costume for the creature pumpkinhead 2 fails at being slightly horrorific butchers the story and basically uses the name and a simliar creature suit to create an otherwise completely irrelevant sequel it 's like a group of writers saw a picture of pumpkinhead on the internet read his name \( and that 's all they read \) and decided to make their own movie as for the plot \( if anyone cares \) a deformed boy dies and comes back as a monster to exact revenge on the people who hurt his feelings i 'll admit if they had altered the look of the creature a bit and had chosen a different name for the movie this would 've been worth two or three stars as a so bad it 's good b flick but the fact that they totally butchered the original by attempting to connect this garbage to it really kills it if you have n't seen 1988 's pumpkinhead rent it or buy it it 's a horror masterpiece \( especially compared to this \) with so much going for it but avoid this sequel at all costs i hate to put down any product but i feel that this one deserves it	4

1	entrepreneur magazine is an easy read that allows us working professionals to have access to fresh ideas and interesting articles i consider it a bargain given the amount and quality of information i receive for about a buck there are a lot of ads and subscription offers to deal with but that seems to be the case with most media i do not consider this a substitute for reading books on business it is a good complement however	4
0	i was very excited to get this game i did read previously written reviews my 13 yr old daughter wants to become a veterinarian someday and loves spending time on the computer so this just seemed like the perfect christmas gift alas the game has many faults that does interfere with the game being enjoyable ! i should have listened to the reviews the game is extremely glichy ! it makes playing it very hard and frustrating my daughter tried for one week and has given up the characters get stuck and just stand and vibrate on the screen until you start the game over sometimes she will play for a half hour before it starts up and sometimes it does this right away very disappointing also some internal setup issues of the actual cd is that it works better running from the disk then saving it to the computers hard drive we have a pretty new computer we have windows xp this program just does n't run well off our computer anyway we have other games that do n't have this problem in fact my son got a game building machines and inventions and it does n't have any of these problems and actually requires more from my hard drive also my daughter complains of some of the limitations within pet vet that do n't allow her to change you have to pay a specified amount to hire an employee and the employee in this game is a slouch there are no other choices when hiring staff no wage choices you ca n't get this employee to work or and you cannot hire anyone else overall because of the gliches in the game she has n't been able to play it to the programs full potential and has given up so the idea is great but the makers should have looked at this better before taking the consumers money and putting it on the market i cannot find any fixes or downloads online to repair it either big bummer ! ! ! beware ! just don't buy this one look elsewhere	4

0	sorry but this movie blew ! the premise was there but the delivery just sucked i can only take the suspension of belief so far we are supposed to believe that this guy has never told his new gf \( whom he 's been w for at least a year \) about his last one before that and gf before that at least two of them have his home phone number they 've never called \? she 's never seen the caller id \? she 's never answered the phone \? give me a break ! then she holds fake interviews with the exes and just opens up the most ridiculous can of worms she meets up with joyce \( the most recent \) whom she finds out that she genuinely likes and starts believing that the bf should really be with her joyce is none the wiser but if you ask me joyce had stalker qualities b c she harassed him when he was with the model calls his house right back when she gets the call on her phone keeps that stupid boomerang in a frame etc this chick stacy \( brittany m \) had to be incredibly stupid not to see where this was ultimately going holly hunter 's character is precisely why i have more male friends than female stacy just met this woman and she 's revealing all these things about her personal life and this woman is all too happy to help her wallow in the craziness of this movie i never expected the 'big climax ' but i did ask myself several times will this barb \( hh \) chick back the off \? ! on to the climax it was actually a surprise but what blew me was that everything ended up honky dory for stacy after she humiliated all those people i never got the impression that the bf \( derrick \) was cheating on her yet that tacky talk show would have made you think different the only reason he pissed me off was because he did n't read stacy the riot act in the end this movie tries to wax philosophical and you just end up hating all of the characters except for the dog a very passible movie i would n't even bother	4

0	we bought our machine 2 weeks ago it looks wonderful nice sturdy with alot of different features but we have n't been able to use it it did n't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with ironman 's customer service department ever since they keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up evertime we call their 1800 number we 're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day well after 2 weeks we 've had it ! we 're taking it back and never buying another ironman product again they 're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they wo n't get anyone out there to fix it \? nothing against the store they 've been great just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer	4
0	i owned this sony for a single day before i returned it to amazon first off it records in mpeg2 format which is fairly compressed and looks it once you upload to your computer it is also not natively supported on the mac without a 20 additional quicktime mpeg2 plugin which has to be converted before editing which makes it a slow tedious affair also the included software is surprise pc only other problems not computer related the chroma shift in night mode is intense making the healthiest of complexions appear sickly i'm not expectant of miracles in night modes but it seems like a simple solution on the production side \( sony \) the auto white balance could also use the same attention like the previous reviewer pointed out not a bad camera for the money if you 're not serious about editing and you 're using a pc the lcd touch screen is a nice addition and easy to use all in all i would go for a canon	4
0	i bought this stroller last year when it went on sale at a local story luckily it was a floor model so it was even further discounted i bought it because it was lightweight had a front tray adult drink holder and was in a very stylish orange color i was looking for a stroller with all the features of my full size gracco but light weight and smaller to put in my trunk well after a couple weeks i changed back to my umbrella stroller and use my graco for longer trips here are the negatives i experienced with the peg prego aria poor steering can not handle quick turns sun shade only works for direct overhead sun 5 point harness is poorly designed the plastic hook is always coming undone and gets tangled my drink holder broke overpriced for features and quality my positives are nice looking easy to fold lightweighti keep this stroller in our attic now as an extra stroller for when we have company thankfully it folds up small and does not take up too much room ! i would not buy a peg prego again	4
1	at first it was a little hard to get my pictures to look as good as the samples but i found that by re sizing them to about an inch or so on the computer before downloading them that they show up alot better also the ones with higher contrast are easier to see farther away just look at the samples that come pre loaded to remind yourself that it is possible to get great looking pics at a surprisingly high resolution after a few practice downloads i was thrilled with the results another plus this one came with a wall charger most have to be plugged in to the usb to charge the wall charger makes it perfect to share on vacation when you 're away from your computer	4

1	there are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed the first is the type of advertising and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have it is pretty clear right away that woodworker 's journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill the advertised 'big toys' run in the 500 to 1500 dollar range although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the 'best' way to do something a recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw writing is solid and reasonably illustrated but they devote little space to what you should already know which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro the magazine is very tool oriented there is n't a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you however traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due i found the woodworker 's journal suited me quite well and i expect to continue reading it	4

0	i purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature the positive reviews here are from first impressions however i have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use when i first received it it felt very light and cheaply made i gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best last time it worked the motor slowed down to almost a halt i keep it cleaned and oiled the motor is just too cheap im not sure what the company wahl was thinking when they made this product they should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image i would not even attempt to use my warranty because it 's not defected parts it 's a total lemon it would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund i would even pay the difference i do not recommend this product	4
0	most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks i talked to dislike this product i 've used it a number of times myself and i would never use it again \( especially after i discovered better products \) it turns your chain and drive train into a black mess finish line was better triflow was recommended by a number of cyclists	4
0	i too read the ta for tots to my 3 5 year old 30 years ago she loved it a lot so i 've been looking for it again this time for my grand daughter even though the title is different from the original one i knew i purchased it and read it as soon as i received it bottomline this story is not the original one and i do n't like it at all other than showing stereotypical happy prince and princess fairy tale characters \( which i can live with up to a point \) i saw bunches of red flags when i got to the evil witch drawn with a full blown ugly face who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan unhappy because there are so many happy warm fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies without enough warm fuzzies \( we read earlier \) it puts people in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die ouch so instead of embracing the wisdom of old women here we have another story that villifies them \( ok i'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all \) no it 's not funny and there is no way i would introduce this book to any child the book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are as the original book did too bad for using images of warm fuzzies and cold pricklies is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children i am returning the book	4

1	this book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low income communities of color in new york city necessary reading for those who still do not realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further fragment and disenfranchise them	4
0	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up but i'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !	4
0	beware ! this thing even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure as well as not keep it in one spot it took the top layer of skin off ! my poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work ow ! i had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed and what 's worse it did n't take out all the hair i could still see some hair here and there it missed and i thought i got it all i returned it immediately and got a refund on my money never again i 'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead	4
1	typical of central italy this sauce has the characteristic of being hot after all arrabbiata means mad in italian although tolerance to spiciness is very subjective this sauce will not overwhelm your palate enjoy this beautiful blend of flavors the freshness of parsley a hint of hand picked organic marjoram and the madness of the habanero recipe suggestions excellent as a dip for shrimp or chips spicy and delicious over tacos quesadillas or any mexican dish unexpectedly delicious over chicken cutlet or poached fish grilled vegetables au gratin or saut ed portabella mushroom ! we 've also added it to a seafood bouillabaisse for a fantastic dinner party idea	4
1	believe the good reviews written here about this film i havent cared much thus far for the movies penn has directed after this one i suppose its because i feel this is such a great film he created a tough act to follow but even if he never does top it he can rest easy knowing he has made a great film that will stand the test of time i like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into and this is one of those although i would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas but overall this is a great movie with great performances by all and it packs an after punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over im not easily touched by most movies but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits its without a doubt one of my favorite films this is the kind of film that reminds you movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art	4
1	this stone is very functional works well and goes from oven to table because of its beauty if you 've never cooked on stone before prepare to be amazed it 's a must for bread baking to develop a nice bottom crust i also use the stone for baking french fries and other stuff just put the pan directly on the stone and your food will be done faster with use your stone will discolor this happens with any stone you also should not wash any stone with soap use hot water and a plastic scraper to clean this is the only all clad product i have that i ca n't get the stainless to sparkle like new i think it 's because i left it in the oven so much the pizza cutter that comes with this is the best i 've ever used because of its size this product is great as a bake and serve occasional baking stone if you bake a ton i suggest getting a larger stone and just leaving it the oven all the time	4
1	excellent songwriting guitar playing and overdubbing another live album following his first with previously recorded songs not on frampton comes alive would have been just as successful as comes alive days dawning crying clown fanfare are a few such songs a few songs from wind of change something's happening and even a couple from his early days with the herd would have contributed to a second successful live album rather than the i'm in you album which was a terrible disappointment	4

1	nikon has always been the leader in photography camera lenses others have nobly tried but a nikon remains the high bar that others only hope to reach when the shift from film to digital began there was some speculation if nikon could keep up with the competition well rest assure that not only have they kept up they continue to lead the way the latest example of this is the d200 like the d70 d80 this is a solid piece of equipment just the feel of it tells you that you are holding an excellent piece of technology but the proof will always be in the end results and again the combination of the nikon know how and nikon lenses lead even a beginner to come up with excellent pictures gone is the lag between shots you can fire up and shoot multiple pictures in seconds so action shots are all yours without even tweaking a picture with a computer program you can print top of the line photos at home people have cited the cons expensive yes the camera does come with a hefty price tag but it should be kept in mind that this is a piece of machinery intended for serious photographers if you are a vacation and holiday picture taker then you should elect to buy a cheaper camera the same is true with the difficulty of the multitude of small buttons dials and switches there are too many and they can be overwhelming but only to someone who is in the point and shoot school of picture taking anyone else will relish the options that nikon has provided us with on the d200 room for improvement \? well the battery life is nowhere near as good as the d70 which i upgraded from but that is a weak complaint as you can still get hundreds of shots on one charge also it would be a boon if the flash would automatically pop up when needed like in former models so if you are serious about photography and always have one at the ready this is the one for you	4

1	it is interesting to see how golems evolve from pratchett 's discworld novel feet of clay \( 1996 \) where they are speechless slaves of clay to going postal \( 2004 \) where a well educated but humorless golem serves as body guard and lecturer in morals to the new post master this is where it all begins commander sir samuel vimes of ankh morpork 's night watch pays a visit to the dragon king of arms at the urging of his new wife who thinks sam needs his own coat of arms now that he 's been knighted unfortunately one of sam 's ancestors was a regicide so his descendent is denied an armorial bearing by the college of heralds he does learn that one of his watchmen is actually the earl of ankh the inimitable corporal nobbs who is forced to carry around a piece of paper signed by ankh morpork 's patrician certifying that he 's really human well this is a bit of a come down for sir sam but he 's got more important matters on his mind including the murders of two harmless old men one of them was beaten to death by a loaf of dwarf bread his body was discovered by captain carrot and corporal angua the only werewolf in the night watch when they visited the dwarf bread museum on their day off the only link between the two corpses is a trace of white clay at both murder scenes subplots zigzag every which way through feet of clay corporal 'earl of ankh' nobbs is being courted by a group of well nobs who have n't given up on the notion that ankh morpork should be ruled by a king captain carrot hereditary king of ankh morpork who wisely refused the crown in men at arms is busy tracking murderers and emancipating golems sargeant colon is about to retire if he lives through a trip through the sewers with wee mad arthur corporal angua helps a new dwarf recruit come to terms with her yen to wear lipstick death who has at least a walk on role in all the discworld fantasies is still working on his sense of humor i am death not taxes i turn up only once if this sounds confusing it is n't it 's brilliant all of the story lines tie together according to character i do n't know how pratchett digs through the sewers and stockyards of ankh morpork and rubs together a monarchist plot with a bit of animated clay to create such a gem i think he must use magic	4

0	this particular dvd edition of nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film 's mood i'm not sure when this score was written although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film with this edition 's music i got confused at times between what i saw and what i heard and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while if you want an affective edge of the seat experience out of nosferatu i reccomend another edition	4

0	when you subscribe to the wall street journal it 's like getting two newspapers a good news reporting paper and an what at times seems like an editorial page written by sophmomores in the local young americans for freedom college rag it 's not that i mind right wing editorials i'm somewhat of a libertarian myself it 's just that its editorial page puts ideology ahead of reason far too often for my taste for a much better deal business news all the financial quotes much better international coverage and excellent and concise reporting choose the financial times at the moment an annual subscription is selling for 50 it 's a much better publication and on saturday 's has a very fine weekend section with good book reviews and arts and culture coverage also because the ft is based out of london the editors are much more balanced and less cowed or ideologically obedient even if they were similarly priced the ft would be the better deal as it is the ft costs a fraction of the price of the wsj	4
0	this is my favorite production of the alice books i love the sets songs and casting it 's also very british which i think adds another great element to the mix however skip this dvd edition i got it excited to see alice's adventures in wonderland in widescreen and perhaps a better print than what 's previously been available no such luck the dvd appears to be struck from the same crappy vhs version that 's been out there for ages faded colors pan and scan in this age of dvd quality like this is such a shame	4

1	this one came out in '91 its one of the very few albums that included the almighty joe preston on bass one of the great things about this cd is that all the songs are all on one track so it forces you to listen to this long winding sludgefest in its entirety as most melvins fans know this \( along with houdini \) was the pinacle of their musical career after this they made some great albums and some good ones but never better than their self titled album \( previously titled lysol but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit \) it would be ultra cool if ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re issue treatment it definitely deserves it	4

0	very simply put the sound is wonderful the design stinks i too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones that lasted 2 days and they fell off i do n't know what bose is thinking clearly they are not doing any end user testing update bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently do n't fall off pretty cool i gotta upgrade my rating from 2 to	4
0	as others have said this was a much anticipated game i played caesar ii and iii and was extremely excited when i heard that iv was coming out what a letdown ! i did n't have any of the installation errors that others have mentioned and i have n't had the game crash on me however the game is unplayable on my system which is only a year old unless i turn down 90 of the advanced graphics by unplayable i mean ten seconds or more of waiting between the time you click with your mouse and when the game responds even with the graphics turned down i still get lag when the auto save starts as mouse control is essential when building roads or aquaducts this is aggravating in the extreme it appears that sierra 's programmers and designers put a lot of work into upgrading the graphics too bad i ca n't see them ! the interface is horrible and takes up the right half of the screen at 1280x1024 resolution this means that you must rotate the map to build along the right edge i much prefer the tabbed building interface of the other city building games although you can build roads along the diagonals in this game which you could n't in earlier versions the interface is not smart enough to auto rotate the buildings to fit along the roads you have to click and drag to rotate buildings and lag even at the low graphics settings can make this an exercise in frustration i dislike the new warehouse management panel the sliders might look cool but they 're slow \( lag ! \) i would 've liked to see additional options for only store basic goods only store luxury goods etc this would take some of the pain out of managing them trade ports are different also you ca n't see prices ! it appears that some of the scenarios have hidden milestones that you have to meet in order to advance in the one i'm playing right now i'm stuck because my prosperity rating will not rise above 36 \( 50 required to win \) i have over 30 000 denarii in my treasury and have been turning a hefty profit \( and meeting various demands from rome \) for at least eight years of game time i have met and exceeded all other requirements for victory but prosperity continues to elude me my city is almost completely automated by now the only thing i do is respond to rome 's requests for goods or cash my advisors have nothing helpful to say it 's not fun if i ca n't advance so while the game is pretty from what i can see of it it 's got too many frustrations to be worth much more of my time	4
0	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out firstly the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought it still could have worked for my but for one thing this bag is not designed for those with a er womanly build it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online just a word of warning to the ladies	4

0	i 've been kinda exclusive to remington ms3 's for a few years they 've just been had inexpensively here and there so that 's the main reason i 've stuck it out but in all honesty these seem to cost me more than i 've thought in the past like other reviews have stated this razor takes effort to get close hair does collect on the foils and thus as i 've noticed causes the blades to bind on stubble i'm a patient person not usually in a hurry to shave so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning but here 's the weakness the foils are like paper and flake holes in them i just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks \( a good deal i thought for a microscreen 3 \) my other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two \( once a hole developed and i 'd rashed up my neck accidentally i removed the bad foil \) i 'd bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those so i thought a new unit was the trick well now just three months later the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two \( used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out \) my bathroom is riddled with these things my patience is now out and i'm headed back to an old faithful braun	4

0	having been a fan of joan osborne 's take of son of a preacher man on her original indie record and heat wave from the recent 'standing in the shadows of motown' soundtrack i was looking forward to hearing this record of covers i was ultimately disappointed first of all i have to say there are two real gems on here that really needed to be updated one for its amazing vocal instrumental sound \( the spinners' i 'll be there \) and the other for its message \( timmy thomas' why ca n't we live together \) to be sure there are some great tunes on here that i am always up for listening to such as stevie wonder 's love 's in need of love today and undisputed truth 's smiling faces somtimes but osborne adds little to these when she does change things around the effect is questionable i know that norah jones has brought back the torch song style but osborne 's bluesy take on edwin starr 's war is seriously misguided the same is true when you rip the melody and add bland vocals to classics like aretha franklin 's think or the band 's the weight especially since the former could have really used some punch from such a powerful singer like osborne overall this was a missed opportunity i hope her upcoming 2005 record is a reinvention	4
0	i picked this book up at my public library because i had put it on my reading list a while back when i saw that the president \( ! \) of the united states george bush read it while he was on vacation too i went to my local cofee place and got a medium regular cofee flavored cofee but in a large cup \( so theres room for plenty of milk which i like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large \) anyway i am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where i have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there so then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning and he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing anyway then he leaves and i notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as i thought previously so i'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so i take it back to the library now here i have to point out that i had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that i returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever i go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when i turn the book in i explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the 8 50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me but you can guess how this ended up i am down another 8 dollars and change \( i paid the 50 cents in pennies i got from the place i keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since i counted them out one by one but it was worth it \) and i never finished the book since it was ruined but ! i liked the parts i read okay and if the president likes it i guess it gets four stars only i made it two stars because i only read half maybe i will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then i will come back and give this book it 's missing two stars if it ends well lesson learned is life is not always fair but you keep on keepin on like they say	4
1	hermann baumann is one of the greatest horn players ever and he shows why he has been given that honor on this cd i do n't think that there is recording of the haydn concerto that even comes close to this masterful performance even better than tuckwell 's the cadenzas are absolutely awesome i have n't listened to the rosetti before but baumann sounds excellent in this concerto as well clevenger plays ok on the haydn but his articulation is a little sloppy i'm a saxophone player but i can recognize true musicianship when i hear it and baumann certainly is a brilliant musician highly recommended	4

1	i'm a long time canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade i can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera the pictures are fuzzy take a look at one of the newer canons with image stabilization and i think you 'll be happier	4
0	this is a wonderful item if or when it works it prints the pictures beautifully if it works the trouble is that after using it for a little while \( and i mean a little while \) it will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink i have messed with it and messed with it for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this does n't work all the time right now my printer wo n't work and i cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink are n't cheap i think it is cheaper going down to walmart and using their instant photo machine this is not worth the money or the aggravation ! ! ! !	4

1	dvd 1 presents a terrific hour long history of the franchise it hits both the high and lowpoints and indicates why the packers are a national treasure and probably the greatest team in nfl history lambeau hutson lombardi starr nitschke the ice bowl favre white the nine nfl championships the three super bowls they won \( i ii and xxxi \) and the one they lost \( xxxii \) the best fans in the league the smallest venue the most legendary stadium and the team 's miraculous survival over 80 years in no small part because they are the only pro team in any sport that is entirely owned by their fans the highpoint of course is the 15 minute section entitled lombardi which encapsulates the green bay career of the nfl 's greatest coach but at the end of this dvd about the packers' heroic ongoing history you realize that as great as lombardi was the team is greater still dvd 2 was produced earlier in vhs format \( i bought it at the packer pro shop in gb \) and portrays the greatest game in packers history and one of the greatest in nfl history other reviewers have justly praised its play by play reconstruction and modern day interviews with the participants yes kramer was offside but luck is a part of any game and the cowboys had a generous helping of it in the second quarter like another reviewer i love the postgame interviews even the glimpses of green bay in 1967 the muted colors of the frigid game \( maybe packer jerseys actually were that dark in the 60s i see the same thing in footage of other games \) and the elegaic tone of the final interviews give a haunting sense of a world that is now departed	4

0	23 for the chinese version and the english subtitles are mad the english subtitles available on american cable television enhance the drama so tape off of cable i do n't regret this purchase because i think drama sets should be 25 tops and the camera is so clear on this dvd compared to what is seen on american cable that you can really see how old the teenagers are it made for a more enjoyable viewing experience for me when i did n't really care for it when it was mistier and flawless on cable so what if there are a lot of matching fat scarves and sweaters in this series \? i do n't get the appeal of this show at all i thought it was really slow my favorite part was a barfing drunk girl in the background of one scene but otherwise i felt my hair turning white watching the characters walk and walk breath in breathe out and ponder ponder i think the phenomenon of the show 's popularity is a tidge more interesting than the show but it is still boring boring boring just thinking about this show strips another layer of elasticity from my heart it 's so boring p s this drama got a 20 rating domestically but sam soon and jang geum scored 50 hahaha	4
1	my 2 year old loves his video the animations are unusual but they are full of flare color and imagination the songs they include are by far the best part and my daughter ca n't get enough of them the main character moustache and the rest of the characters are all well imagined and fun as far as the learning experience my daughter loves to repeat the phrases and sing the songs and i see her using what she has learned all the time and the semi interactive format they use really gets her involved in the story line i personally love this video and would recommend it	4

0	if you want the original recordings do n't purchase any volume of television 's greatest hits i 've had better luck recording the songs off of my tv with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my pc these collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of the beverly hillbillies and the munsters that just do n't sound right to me if the original recordings do n't matter to you then you may like this cd	4

1	the speck rubber case is the best case i 've found for my blackberry 7290 that being said it 's not ideal and i 'd make a few changes pros protects case well no screen scratches minimizes accidental keystrokes while in your bag no need to use the belt clip \( most women prefer purses totebags to belt clips ! \) and i love the fact that you can easily see whether you have new messages \( no need to take it out of the case in addition to taking it out of your purse or totebag \) cons clear case collects dirt screen cover is slightly opaque and requires greater use of the backlight screen cover does n't fit squarely into the rubber case and screen cover gets scratches on it making the screen harder to read i get a lot of compliments on this case it 's different enough to be noticed and people are envious of my ability to quickly check for messages without having to fumble with opening and closing the case however because of the cons i suspect i 'll need to replace this case more than once a year but i like it enough that i 'll pay the 35 to do so maybe the next version will have some improvements in the meantime i feel like i'm getting my money 's worth out of it	4

0	this is overall a real hoot ! anthony hopkins is superb ! fats the dummy steals lots of the scenes the question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the dummy or ann margarett trying to act ! burgess meredith is great as the manager one point of interest is the horrible score by jerry goldsmith he throws in a great harmonica riff when we see fats but during some of the more romantic scenes the music is so cloying it would make yanni blush don t miss the extras where they talk with the real vent that worked with them on the movie if you like movies that are a bit outside this is a must have for any collection pete cavan	4
1	i 've had several gens of the candybar blackberries 7100 nice but reception mike was horrendous 7130 much better finally nailed it was dubious when i had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky but i 'll give it the full thumbs up now slightly smaller than 7130 which oddly does make a difference like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something makes my partner 's treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison unobtrustive in yr pocket the pearl trackball is just fine like it better than roller actually reception mike quality are also good despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130 writing is good too the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate i sometimes forget to check and hey i like having the camera so i thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone the one that i just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great but actually i like the pearl better if you need bulletproof email pda and phone this is yr baby slightly shorter battery life but has n't stranded me yet	4
1	this is truly a beautiful bag ! i got the classic dark leather which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures the leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag 's character the leather is thicker than i expected while it is by no means stiff it is not ultra soft ultra thin butter leather this is leather that will age well and last for many many years the zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather they 'll be durable \( the other hardware is the same type of matte antiqued silver \) the bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap the cotton strap not only adds to the bag 's uniqueness it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over \( i wear it across my chest like a messenger bag \) inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag one is gusseted and works well for a cell phone \( or items of a similar size \) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards i would have really liked for my ipod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick wo n't fit the internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags i 've tried because they were sized for laptops i actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book on the outside each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it this creates 2 tall thin pockets where i keep pens it would have been nice if one side did n't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items but that 's not a problem for me the entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket on the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag the magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong there are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you do n't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag i 've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments though the bag is pricey it is obviously crafted with care from high quality materials it also has a very distinctive look i am very happy with this purchase and have already added another diongini bag to my amazon wish list	4

0	first of all i would like to mention that the invicta brand that exists and produces watches nowadays has nothing to do with the swiss company that bears the same name but went into bankruptcy a few decades ago the actual invicta company is an american one and has bought the rights to use this name the mechanisms are swiss made or made in japan about the ones made in switzerland i cannot post an opinion this particular model \( 9211 \) which i purchased this year has a japanese mechanism \( made by myota i think \) every 24 hours it loses some precious seconds so after a few days it becomes a matter of minutes in conclusion it has a problem with precision beeing unable to keep time with accuracy i would advise anyone who wants to buy this watch to think twice of course the discount price is attractive but the watch does n't meet it 's expectasions i consider that a minimum dose of accuracy is required the only good aspect about this watch is it 's appearance learn from other 's mistakes	4

1	i could not resist trying this method of making espresso you know you can spend alot trying to get a decent product and i have not been disappointed with the practically inexpensive bialetti the first attempt was successful and that told me this was for me the bonus milk frother made more froth that an old steamer frother i used to have there are a few tricks with the frother \( 1 milk by itself not so good but add some half and half to the milk and voile' \) the milk mixture needs to be heated enough to coat the back of a spoon pump it quickly and serve regarding the espresso maker itself just do n't add any more water than to that line and oh do n't open the lid to look at it until it is done or you will get sputter onto your stove top to know when the espresso is done just listen you will know when it is done very quick and yummm	4
1	this fragrance took me quite by surprise when i first tried it from a magazine sample so much so that i knew i had to try it at a department store this was a little over a year ago then i sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was wow ! gardenias from my grandmother 's garden the suntan oils tropical perfumes that i smelled as a little girl at the beach with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual i knew i had to have it ! i bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my x mas list which my sweet generous boyfriend got for me in my opinion this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that i have ever smelled i feel very alluring every time i wear it for my boyfriend and he loves it ! so this would be a great gift for a man 's wife or girlfriend or for a woman 's best friend sister or cousin \( as long as you wear it for your own man too ! \) but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother aunt or grandmother it 's that enticing but if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts then have it given by one of her female friends sister cousin or santa that way there wo n't be any awkwardness at gift giving time believe me this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of french lingerie or a string bikini !	4
0	consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing \( as a non techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp \) expect these to fail within 1 2 years expect to pay approx 400 to replace the color wheel and 200 to replace the colling fan that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1 2 years and some more often than that the lamp costs approx 150 250 depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another 1 2 years while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait 15 minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered ! now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely ! it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand i have had my tv for 18 months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time ! i have a 42 samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 crt both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare ! you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every 2 years if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty ! it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months ! i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line expect dlp prices to drop even further but please look before you leap	4

0	after hearing about this product and reading the reviews decided to get one for our newborn baby the problem however is that this does not cover the entire room even on its high setting over the course of an hour i would say this thing covers only a sixth of the air in our room \( 12 x 12 \) i put my hand in front of the sanitizer and could barely feel any airflow and this was on the high setting i 've only had this product for a month so i will have to follow up on durability first month impression is this thing is too weak to adequately sanitize an entire room if it were a bit stronger would give a better rating i feel like i will return this item and get a stronger air cleaner or buy 3 of these \( not practical \)	4

0	i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years i was extremely happy with my olympus but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting this camera was such a disappointment just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it \( this only happened when using the flash i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash \) plus if you used the zoom at all the pictures came out fuzzy the first digital camera i ever owned \( 7 years ago \) took better pictures ! the store i bought the camera from would n't take it back because i waited two days past the 14 day return policy so i sold the camera and took a 100 loss i 'd much rather lose than keep this camera	4

1	i saw a high school production of brigadoon in san francisco at the ica \( immaculate conception academy \) at 24th and guerrero these girls who played the parts had never been anywhere near scotland you could tell and some had not been in the usa very long and the charming accents of south of the border stood in for the strong scots burr nevertheless they played the show beautifully and ever since then i have had a fondness for the music and the story i feel that the makers of moulin rouge were probably trying to capture some of the big hearted appeal of brigadoon when they created their fantasy world watching the movie i have always felt that a bit of the magic was lost because so much of minnelli 's canvas was spent on dance elements which imho are just not that interesting so many dance numbers created to take advantage of gene kelly 's and cyd charisse 's astonishing abilities maybe too many ! thus some of the musical numbers had to be cut out including some of the loveliest of the songs lerner and loewe wrote for the 1947 musical imagine my surprise and delight when the new dvd came out this spring and i discover that in fact minnelli did film three of the rejected songs \( and recorded another perhaps the greatest \) and that all of this deleted material would be available on the disc i was in hog heaven however we are all familiar with some deleted scenes that you watch and then you say well i know why that sucker got deleted and i was afraid that these scenes would be of inferior quality \( like is it a crime \? in bells are ringing forgive me crime fans ! \) but it is my pleasure to report that all 3 numbers here are keepers i wish somehow they had been re integrated back into the main print of brigadoon and we could then judge the movie for once and for all the way minnelli wanted it if it is too long then maybe shorten down the sword dance i feel sure that somewhere footage must exist for the exquisite there but for you go i or is that just a dream of mine \? in any case we can now hear the track and we can see the fully staged versions of come to me bend to me and the marvelous from this day on which is to brigadoon what from this moment on is to kiss me kate all in all the plus factor makes this disc the one to buy if you 're wanting the full brigadoon magic	4
1	ever wished you could rub your eyes while you 're wearing your make up \? now you can you ca n't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never ever smudge one might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night but all you need to remove it is water this stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved	4
1	this is my first bergman \( and i did not pay 36 for it i bought it for 99 cents on ebay completely new played fine \) i bought several bergmans \( almost all from ebay they 're very expensive otherwise \) when his name kept popping up in connection with woody allen a hero of mine i liked this movie very much it was warm and soothing and interesting i was struck at first with the simplicity of the symbols and the extremely detailed direction \( e g when the old man starts while leaving the room to move a chess piece then changes his mind and continues on out of the room \) i have 6 of his films left to watch and i'm looking forward to them particularly the ones with dubbed in english which most of them are as for its being similar to a woody allen flick all that comes to mind is another woman but i 'll hold my tongue \( fingers \) i have 6 more to see what really does come to mind and the reason i gave this flick such a mediocre rating is a christmas carol ! it 's better than i ever thought dickens was but the dickens came first i loved the movie until i realized that	4
1	i agree that this drive can be a little slow but it has n't caused a problem for me i keep copies of many files \( about 1 gb total \) related to a large project at work on mine when i first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes but now i just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that i do n't even notice them \( just a second or two \) i also seemlessly work on the files on both a pc at work and a mac at home to me the best feature is the reliability between my husband and i we 've had several cruzer minis in various sizes and each one has worked great even through accidental abuse one of his 512 mb drives accidently went through the washing machine we thought the data was gone but when it dried out it worked fine just today i found my 2 gb drive at the bottom of the dryer it had been left in a pocket and had gone through both the washing machine and dryer yep it still worked ! i'm buying a new one to replace it \( just in case \) because i do n't know it there might be some long term effects from the water and heat but i 'll keep using this one for less important applications changes are good though that it 'll never have a problem these things are amazingly reliable	4

0	my sister in law bought this product for me after i had admired the shade \( purr a light baby pink color \) that she was wearing i have used other mac products before with great results but was very dissapointed with this product first of all i gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring however this product is sticky very sticky ! it does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips not only is it sticky but just down right uncomfortable when i wear a lip gloss i want to be soft and smooth feeling i want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak also because of this gloss' consistancy it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed this will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips ! ! ! ! this product seems to be popular with other viewers however i would never reccomend this to anyone	4

0	take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same really is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids \? they deserve better the key point of this movie is that lying is bad good point a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks also good unfortunately the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible \( even kids will have a hard time believing a man ca n't tell he 's been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror \) and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion the entire thing falls flat making films for children is a fine thing they should n't be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children however quite honestly i 'd rather have a kid watch something like good will hunting before this do n't waste your children 's time with this film read them a book a good book instead	4
0	i received my curious perfume not last christmas but the christmas before and i was so excited i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over using every tester i could find when i got it i was just as happy and used it just so carefully i wanted it to last for years i got the one that comes with the pump the largest bottle anyway i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there yellow my curious perfumewentyellowand apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling crud around the bottle and just today i went over to it only to find it leaking all over my table i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking i squeezed it again and my curious perfume splerted out it now smells offand does n't really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed i am disgusted and soso angrythat perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it 's own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume \( i did n't even know that was possible \) i am disgustedwhat a cheap nasty nasty product do not buy it unless you think you 're going to use it within a period of 1 year good work ! a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it	4

0	this was a real let down for my daughter she loves horses and has several breyer horses when we saw this paddock she was so excited about it we decided to get it for her for christmas it is very flimsy does not stay together and breaks easily she spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it after a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away only the doll and horses were salvagable	4
0	men of a certain age will remember how when we were kids and this was played on tv in the early 80s we thought it was so cool when a huge army of police officers fired so many shots into a house that it eventually collapsed and when a bus was shot full of holes by an even larger army of cops but those two over the top scenes are all this movie has going for it the other action scenes are pretty silly and unbelievable especially scenes involving a sniper in a helicopter and atop a parking structure both of whom were in ca n't miss positions and missed anyway moreover if you know anything about law the plot is beyond silly it involves eastwood being sent from phoenix to las vegas to escort a witness being extradited back to arizona for a trial the witness will testify about bad behavior on the part of the phoenix police commissioner and a corrupt assistant district attorney is involved with the commissioner in a coverup assuming a material witness can be extradited which i doubt the crime appears to have been committed in vegas so it would tried in vegas not phoenix and if the ada prosecuting the case was corrupt and wanted to cover for the commissioner he could just dismiss the case and there would be no need to murder the witness the idea that they would want to draw attention to the case by having 200 cops line up and try to assassinate the witness is beyond ridiculous in sum the plot and the action were both absurd and the only interesting scenes were the crazy firepower overkill at the house and on the bus but those two scenes probably ca n't carry the entire movie for the average viewer	4
0	multi page story on asphalt \? who the f k cares ! ! ! skimpy and unfocused editorially the only thing they 're consistent about is the use of short punchy blurbs in different fonts and sizes for example they had mari holden on the cover of a recent issue promising pro secrets what was her secret \? my parents told me to use a helmet and similar advice from other pros read cycleplus magazine from the uk for an in depth systematic approach to product review ride routes \( almost all in the uk \) and a variety of short relevant articles that inform without dumbing down the issue \( ok the two pages on yoga every month is a bit too much but they can get away with that becaause the magazine is so much fatter that bicycling	4

1	i think this movie goes right to the heart of the philosophical question of what art and artists are supposed to be and do are they merely to present facts ideas personalities images with no comment no moralizing no personal ulterior motives \( leaving all those things to the viewer \) or do they need to state clearly a moral purpose and certain direction \( which the viewer can then accept or reject \) \? martin sheen is kit a garbageman working in south dakota he becomes friends with 15 year old holly \( sissy spacek \) when her father tells sheen he does n't want him near his daughter again sheen kills him the two run off together living for a while in the woods like two innocents of some primitive society but then they 're discovered by three men and sheen kills them too they now head for montana sheen committing more murders along the way he is empty inside nothing fazes him he imagines he 's like james dean misunderstood alienated but he does n't have a clue what he should be alienated against and as far as being misunderstood he never once gives the least hint there is anything there to understand we finish watching the movie feeling as empty as sheen i also felt a little angry at malick 's attempt to con me into thinking there is more to sheen 's vapid character than there really is he truly is just a non entity who kills half a score of innocent people so back to my first paragraph malick obviously works from the perspective of the first half of my question posed \( a view that became an obsession i think with artists writers film makers etc beginning in the late 1960s \) i tend toward believing the second half suum cuique	4

0	comparing oceans 11 of the 1960s to the remakes of today is like comparing the vegas casinos of yesteryear and today the hippest casinos of that era were by today 's highest standards of casino elegance and class \( no i'm not talking about excalibur \) dull smokey hokey and cramped just like the original oceans 11 i'm as fascinated with the rat pack as much as anyone but i think it 's important to take the rose colored glasses off when critiquing the work of these sometimes neurotically insecure and deeply flawed individuals in order to judge a movie on its own merits i think too many peoples' sense of self identity is reflected in the image of the rat pack to ever really do objectivity justice humor and style do evolve \( my father for example finds no humor in some of the most critically acclaimed shows on tv today \) so it 's hard to compare two different eras nevertheless great timeless cinema came out of this era but this work is not in that category by any movie standards it drags heavily and its hipness seems contrived and forced into an otherwise hokey vibe the musical interludes and final stride down the strip are incredible for reinforcing this image \( and i do love them as stand alone moments \) but jar so completely with the tone and style of the rest of the movie that i ca n't help but think this was just a vanity flick to satiate the appetites of fans hungry to devour media images of the highest style and pizzaz that era had to offer regarding the issue of whether this movie appeals only to an older generation it should be noted that those in the younger generation who have reviewed this movie favorably are teenagers there may be something deeper at work here an adolscent \( or arrested adolesecent \) quest for a two dimensional this is what cool is mantra by fans of any age to me this movie is little more than a vain time capsule revealing how much tighter interesting and more sophisticated not only most movies but perhaps society at large has become that said there 's still an audience for the old school casino in which dank slot machines greet you at the door on the way to the cheap buffets just as there is and always will be an audience that smugly holds this 1960s ocean 11 as superior i know i 'll take a hit in terms of was this review helpful points from this crowd but by the nature of who they are they got away with a lot that would never compel an objective viewer free from the folklore enmeshed in this intriguing group 's fame	4
0	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products	4

1	if this is to truly be gybe 's last piece of work then they 've concluded their brief and dynamic catalog on a fitting note while i still believe lift yr skinny fists is their masterwork yanqui is easily a close second where fists had a broader range of sounds and textures elements of sacred and profane yanqui is more balanced and focused although you could argue this point i think yanqui never gets as high or low as fists the sound on yanqui is entirely consistent with their previous releases as other reviewers mentioned the only major change is the absence of field recordings which actually helps to distinguish this album as the finale the lack of human voice adds a new aura of mystery to the work well there is actually another surprising moment on this album it happens during a movement about halfway into the album the guitars drop off leaving only a small ensemble playing dissonant woodwinds over a steady tribal percussion for a few minutes it definitely does n't sound like typical gybe in fact the dissonant horns sound almost like a ligeti composition \( although ligeti probably would n't have used a steady rhythm of any kind \) fear not not only does it work but it swells nicely into a full band tidal wave but here 's the most important point i want to make about yanqui to me it resolves some of the musical themes fists introduced which makes u x o a fitting conclusion the last bit on mfer redeemer p 1 slows way down featuring one guitar with one violin \( i think \) playing together in fragile harmony along with some distortion in the background when i listen to this i ca n't help but think of the very beginning of fists except the melody changes just enough to resolve the paranoia that the fists melody introduced in other words it 's like i can hear gybe at last acknowledging that there does exist some hope ! some goodness ! some peace ! in this world the very place that 's inspired them to make such dissonant music and well if gybe can slow down and acknowledge something hopeful exists well then hope must exist indeed mother er does redeemer of course they give us one last act on yanqui just to kick our butts one final time yes it gets so out of control that at one point the siren that 's blaring in the background seems appropriate the very end i love as it builds and builds and builds with distortion and droning until the music finally it suddenly ends yanqui u x o is possibly the final act in a brief but brilliant catalog it 's an awesome finale	4
0	got one as a christmas present great concept but the performance falls well short of the promise as another reviewer noted wine from my wine fridge \( 56 deg \) registered as 74 deg when placed into the unit wine at room temp \( 72 deg \) regularly registered 78 deg or so although the unit ran through it 's cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was in fact if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier i tried about half a dozen times over a couple days but it never worked properly we returned the unit to the store for credit	4
0	i used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way i want my hair cleaned not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products people have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores that they do not realize they are paying for detergent in the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have jonathan is not the only good product out there i have been using phyto shampoo from france and kiehl 's both do n't have the silicon smoothers either and yes the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair ! ! ! ! i used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the shampoo i have not tried the conditioner but will try it too	4

0	i tried this knife at sur la table at the furi demo they appeared to be very sharp however i did not like these knives for the following reasons1 \) i dont care much for the cheap plastic like orange handles2 \) the finish on the knives appear to be cheap furi implies that these knives are made in germany however they are cheaply made in china now generally i dont care that much everything is now made in china anyways but when i am paying so much money for a product i was hoping it was made in germany or usa 3 \) the case is even more cheaply made personally i would wait for a sale on the global or the wustof knives	4
0	i bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods ten months later i hardly ever use the darn thing it worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases my complaints with the product not particularly sturdy the backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily the straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere however everytime i remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear and unfortunately it seems i need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured \( another complaint \) the second tray which pops on over the swing away tray \( at least on my particular model \) is very easily removed by my son he lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor the point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably this seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat it has to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over the good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space it is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites if i had it to do over i would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand	4

1	i had been hearing about steel cut oatmeal and the benefits of eating it for quite sometime now this is my first time ever trying this and i must say that i am extremely impressed now i have n't tried any other brands but i definitely would recommend this brand i received my order rather quickly \( within a week \) the amount of oats i received for the price is amazing the 70oz can is huge the great thing about this product you do n't have to use a lot it at one to produce a sizeable meal i believe the suggested serving size is 1 4 of a cup uncooked it may not look like a lot initially before cooking but after it cooks it swells considerably oh yeah get this i am a type 2 diabetics and usually foods like foods such as rice oatmeal and pasta cause my blood sugars to spike thereafter i feel sluggish until my insulin kicks in to regulate my sugar levels \( maybe i am telling too much of my personal business lol \) not with this i do n't know what it is \( maybe it 's in my mind \) but my body seem to process this differently try it	4

0	to us typical fiestaware pieces have great design color durability and functioning wrapped up all in one we ordered a set of turquoise candlesticks and were disappointed because the candlestick openings are very disparate in size and shape and it was obvious if one chose to use candles it would be a task to insert them properly with quot straight candle quot results even more disappointing was the quality of the color application to the product specifically the lack of even color application to the scrollwork and edges of the bases plus around the edges of the openings for the candles we were sent a replacement set which had even more color variation but the openings for the candles were shaped somewhat better we are returning both sets because they are not pleasing to view due to the shaping and color variations fiestaware can have a color variation that is subtle and uniform a kind of quot softer quot look in the color application around the rims on plates for example and the piece will still look beautiful we do n't want to pay for a product that is not as pleasing to the eye as the rest of our fiestaware products far exceed the quality of these pieces	4
1	i am a solo family medicine physician and have been using the quickbooks pro series since 2003 at first i was a little upset with being forced to upgrade my qb pro 2003 however once i installed the new premium 2006 i must say i am very pleased from the beginning everything has changed just a small bit however in a very good way in my past version of qb pro 2003 i had to toggle between different screens in order to move from deposits to writing checks etc in premium 2006 this is no longer the case a very easy to use and intuitive home page shows everything you need to use each different tool is one simple click away i very much like the new enhanced payroll option in that i can now print out my state tax forms along with my federal forms in the past it would take an hour or two out of my family time in order to fill in those little boxes and double check each figure with my cpa now i print out each form and am finished in less than 10 minutes i would highly recommend this product to any solo or small group practice the versatility and power found in quickbooks premium allows me to keep track of my finances personally the added convenience of the payroll services just makes this product an even better buy yes there are enough subtle differences between the pro and premium version to justify spending a few extra dollars i would definitely buy this software title again	4
1	after the incredible monkey island series was halted i feared that i would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines entertaining dialogue and lush scenery then bully came along and i was hooked this really is a great game and you should n't be set against it because it 's really nothing at all like grand theft auto there 's no blood no sexuality \( except for kissing \) and there 's so many involving and engrossing storylines the characters are also some of the best i 've ever seen each having their own stories and personality the whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school get bully it's an awesome game people who like this game should also look at the monkey island series of games for pc and ps2 and the nancy drew series for pc	4
1	i thank the creators of this film which took me back to the days of growing up in detroit all the time time i was learning every new motown song and every new dance step to go with the newest hits i had no knowledge of the funk brothers i grew up on detroit 's north end and a lot of the motown stars came from this area i connected to the film immediately when it opened to snow covered english tudor homes on detroit 's northwest side the film has wonderful themes fame success heartbreak the beauty of friendship among musicians failure to be recognized recognition much too late and attempts of redemption if not apology i think the whole city of detroit or at least my part of it was heartbroken with the news that motown was moving to los angeles in the film the musicians are given their due a la their cubano brothers and sisters in buena vista social club	4
0	i ca n't believe how many people are saying how realistic this game is that can not be further from the truth all the cpu does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80 of the time regardless of coverage what fun is that \? this in itself is highly unrealistic do n't even get me started on the other things this game does ncaa 2006 is nothing but an arcade game realism is thrown out the window in this one ea does not know the meaning of ai the only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the cpu does do n't waste your money and do n't make ea any more richer its obvious they just throw these games together they just take our money and laugh all the way to the bank	4
1	ohhhhhhhhhh my my my what can i say about this one \? by the time it entered home video on vhs in late 1987 i was not familiar with freddy at all except for the fact that i knew the premise he can kill in your dreams and goes after kids and teens the fact that i was at that time only goin on age 15 did not help i was terrified of anything related to horror in my mind freddy was the worst as a scared 15 year old kid freddy was the last thing i wanted to view i was watching films like raiders of the lost ark and the empire strikes back those i could handle however in late summer of 1987 a friend of mine rang me up and told me to come over because he had a new movie he had rented that he wanted me to watch i asked him what it was and he wouldnt tell me all he said was that id be surprised and that id really like it so i went over and he wouldnt let me see the title on the box he just slid it into the slot of the vcr folks i saw the new line cinema logo and then this graphic sleep those little slices of death how i loathe them edgar allan poe my mind started to reel but i had not yet realized what this film was and then i saw the title a nightmare on elm street 3 dream warriors now mind you the closest i ever came to seeing this film was the wonderfully cool dokken video on mtv called dream warriors i even had a hard time viewing the visage of freddy in that mtv video hilarious huh \? \? anyway when i saw the title come up i grabbed my coat and i was getting the hell out of there and quickly however my buddy begged me to give it a chance he said its not as bad as i was thinkin and that id actually find certain parts of it actually funny now i thought he was pullin my leg with that statement even his mother told me id like it she had already seen it in the theatres and so had my buddy so once i heard her reassure me as well i decided to give it a chance as the opening of the film carried on i viewed the front cover on the box a vicious looking cover with freddy 's face leering over several teens facing him appearing to stand on his out stretched knives with a tagline that i find today to be one of the most creative taglines ever ! ! ! if you think you 'll get out alive you must be dreaming anyhow suffice it to say after experiencing dream warriors i was instantly relieved and i was also an instant fan ! ! i couldnt believe it actually because id sworn this character off i was terrified of him i suppose id have to thank my buddy mike c for that thank you mike for opening the door to this series for me ive loved it ever since ive seen all of them many argue and argue over which film is the best but dream warriors will always hold a special place in my heart because it was my first nightmare and the first time i had to get ready for freddy ! ! \) hope you enjoyed my review by the way i did laugh during my first viewing and i also feel that poster art was the best of all of them	4
0	we bought this when our baby was born \( 6 months ago only used it a few times until recently \) he loves it now to get him to sleep the problem lies in that at 4 am my husband and i awake to hear the mobile playing scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it we go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off causing the mobile to fall on the baby \( he thought it was the funniest thing in the world he was okay thank god \) but the little plastic hook piece was in his hand if you have a 6 month old child you know that they eat everything they can find i thank god that he didnt put that in his mouth it is a great soother for the baby but be sure there are no defects every day ! like i said before other than this it has been great	4

1	i 've lusted after a super auto for years when i finally decided to get one i did a fare amount of investigating the gaggia titanium had the best spec 's for the price and good reviews i decided to spend the extra money for the stainless unit i have n't seen the painted plastic model so i ca n't comment on the appearance i do think the stainless looks great ! you can find reviews of the non stainless here on amazon and other than the outside appearance the device is the same i 've only had the unit for a few days but so far i'm very happy to the negatives first the manual is awful ! it 's not just the italian to english translation ! the text is skimpy and the illustrations not so great i spent a fair amount of time making sure i understood how to setup and use the unit i'm pretty technically savvy and in the end i figured it all out but do n't rush into using this product until you 've figured out how to set it up clean it and adjust all the settings \( there are many \) the only issue i 've had is whereby the auto bean grinder thinks it 's empty when it 's not open the lid \( which could be a bit better designed \) and stir and it works could be the beans i'm using not sure it 's an intermittent issue the good stuff once you figure out the coffee strength and grind the gaggia makes a delicious cup i wish the brew were a tad hotter \( i have it set to max \) but using the cup warmer helps no issues making froth with the wand much better than the older manual machine i had you ca n't put a huge mug under the unit \( the max size is 4 5 inches \) but its so easy to make a cup you just make fresh when needed you can set the unit for the amount of brew however i found that clicking the large coffee button twice the unit thinks it 's making 2 cups and that just about fills a decent size mug it 's much stronger too since the unit grinds two doses of coffee instead of just adding more hot water using the programmable size you get a nice foam on top and as i said the coffee is outstanding i love the clean up \( or lack of \) compared to the drip maker i had \( a bodum vacuum unit \) i still have that unit should i need to make a lot of coffee for company but for the two mugs i drink in the morning the gaggia easily replaces this unit and there 's far less cleanup the grinds sit in a canister and after a few days you just tap it out into the trash and maybe rinse so you can use this gaggia to replace a conventional coffee machine as long as you 're making a cup or two what i love is just pressing a button twice \( for two large coffees \) and walking away from the unit a minute later a great cup of joe it truly is super automatic i have the unit set for energy savor whereby it 's in a kind of sleep mode a few hours after i use it i only drink in the morning however if you decide to wake it up it heats up in about 2 minutes it also does a rinse cycle so i keep a small glass under the unit so it can clean itself and rinse out about 3oz of water there is a little pan under which would catch the water but then you have to toss it out ever few days there 's also a full rinse cycle that thoroughly cleans out the unit and uses about half the water in the reservoir it 's a menu item so do n't select it unless you really want to do this \( takes about 5 minutes and a lot of water goes into the catch pan or several cups if you so desire \) yes it cost big bucks but as long as it works well for years and keeps its great looks i'm very happy update the issue with the grinder was the beans \( too oily \) i called the ny office and got someone in tech support in minutes she knew her product sure enough the inside of the grinder area was super oily making it hard for the beans to fall into the grinder area	4

0	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage and recent years have only accelerated this trend in the 60s and 70s it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend \( originally it was considered quite conservative \) but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop culture fluff with little substance as for its being part of the liberal media this is inaccurate recent coverage of the \( 2004 \) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non person the first debate between john kerry and george w bush was not even covered except for one very brief article listing a few fact check points instead the cover story wa about new products and movies a kind of sharper image catalog lite time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u s election but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment the bias seems to be in favor of mr bush but it 's still mostly bland and superficial your money is better spent on the british magazine the economist which is far more substantive while its editorial viewpoint is conservative it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u s politics the economist also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a \( dare i say it \) fair and balanced approach to the news time can still be entertaining to read but i would n't take what they say too seriously they tend to bend with the political wind	5

0	everybody i know loves this film in today 's environment when wkw is being hailed as the premier director from asia and one of the world 's best i do n't know how many really actually love the film and how many do n't have the courage to state a contrary opinion make no mistake i think wkw is one of the greatest directors i have ever watched how can somebody who makes a movie like in the mood for love \( itmfl \) not be \? actually his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like itmfl but in his versatility it is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both itmfl and chungking well his greatness notwithstanding i ca n't stand this film and no i ca n't sit lie or do anything else with it either so what is it about this movie which gets my goat \? the directorial style and the cinematography actually i think parts of the latter are great and the parts i do n't like are influenced by the former so let me just talk about the former wkw uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films including happy together and fallen angels \( yes i 've seen all of them and hate almost all of them uniformly \) the hallmark of this style is a very modern staccato piecemeal approach stringing together relatively disparate ideas scenes or action sequences \( almost reminiscent of godard 's breathless as the editorial review says here though not quite \) his style is further marked by characteristic filming styles for example the slow shutter speed effect actually this is one of his peeves which even spills over to itmfl where it oh so does n't fit and stands out like a sore thumb having watched nearly all his films and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme i can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage it gets used for dream like sequences for grounded reality for sentimental togetherness for aloofness for tears for laughter for thoughts for action the list goes on wkw similarly uses other weapons in his vast director 's repertoire to some bizarre effects taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory the above notwithstanding let me round off by saying that if the kind of style i have delineated above appeals to you then you should definitely watch this film for outside of his jarring style wkw has pieced together a great story and actors as for myself i will continue to watch every one of his films living in the suspense of what this genius will do next make me fall in love or hate	5
1	i really like this mascara i only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and i have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out otherwise it is the only mascara that does n't cause me to loose a ton of lashes everything else from estee lauder bourjois to great lash causes me loose a lot of lashes i also like that if i cry i do n't wind up looking like a raccoon it subtly melts away no mess ! it washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible not flaky	5
1	thankfully this is not littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies the hallmarks of 99 of the latest and greatest business books especially since it was written in 1999 moore 's is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high tech industry he was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005 the book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation i help run an online software development company and although it is n't exactly high tech i still found the vast majority of it very helpful and the rest of it fascinating market shifts are demanding broadband wireless internet everywhere free companies are shifting towards web basing software applications all very relevant to my business the book is well written an easy and moderately fast read and very accessible by anyone who is technology savvy enough to at least hold an email address yes buy it buy the paperback and save money short synopsis in the infancy of a market products need to be highly tailored to meet the psychological and technical needs of leading edge techno geeks nothing new here when a company wants to take that product and make it marketable to the middle majority where the biggest money sits it requires a commitment to discipline and shift its strategy in order to do so the emphasis shifts intially to identifying a single niche segment and creating a comprehensive tailored product that meets all of their needs create the whole product by using partners and 3rd party services to patchwork the thing together then stop tweaking the product if that works pick related niches and go after them the same way creating the whole product for each of them once people at large are comfortable enough to make the paradigm shift for that market \( this all deals with new high tech changes \) and start doing so en masse the strategy must completely shift again to a ship first fix the product later mentality in a mad market share scramble at this phase you are in the tornado lots of examples of successful and abysmal strategies used by high tech companies whose names are familiar to everyone at each stage mentioned above	5
0	i was a charter subscriber to this magazine when it started up publication it was a breath of fresh air in a stagnant field of almost universally wretched photography magazines over the years things changed columnists died or moved on editorial directions were switched articles that once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers when digital photography became dominant in the marketplace outdoor photographer was in the vanguard pushing every gadget and photoshop manipulation plug in that popped up the magazine became a wasteland of promises of better pictures if you just buy \( fill in the blank with whatever the current trend might be \) what i thought was ironic at the time was that the best photographs they printed were being done by photographers using the least sophisticated equipment photographers using film \( ! \? \) a lot of large format guys occasionally some black and white and stuff made with cameras just about any serious hobbist already owned but these portfolios began to dwindle from occasional to rare to almost non existent at some point my interest in this garbage lapsed before my subscription the magazine made a once monthly trip from the mailbox to the trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it outdoor photographer impresses people who measure quality photography by whether or not the equipment used in production cost the equivalent of the gross national product of small third world countries it offers little in the way of nutrition to a hungry mind it 's empty calories just making you want more and more while starving your potential it truly is wretched	5

1	a pure and engaging story of redemption amongst family `you can count on me' tells the story of sammy \( laura linney \) and terry prescott \( mark ruffalo \) siblings who lost their parents in a horrific car crash when they were still very young years later and sammy is a single mother of 8 year old rudy \( rory culkin \) she works hard at her job at the bank now run by over critical brain everett \( matthew broderick \) and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is \( josh lucas has a great cameo as rudy senior \) when terry shows up after months of no communication sammy is immediately thrilled but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw up and is just using her again terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend 's abortion but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with sammy and rudy over the course of a few weeks terry has made a deep impact especially in the life of young rudy who idolizes him this film follows the changes each of these siblings make changes in themselves but also changes they cause others to make it 's a beautiful story of redemption and acceptance and it should n't be missed the performances by the two leads are outstanding and young rory culkin is adorable and mature as sammy 's son but the real shock to me was matthew broderick who played the demanding philandering unlikable type brilliantly and he 's not one i'm generally impressed with	5

0	let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie 1 it is incredibly beautiful animation2 the music is amazing3 i happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv seriesthe things i do n't like about the movie 1 the characters are not developed at all2 you get the feeling your only skimming the surface like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread3 it almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process ok you may have see that i gave this moive a 2 out of 5 well that is becuase of the story line and plot the story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation the movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end i just kept thinking there has to be more but there was n't the best way i could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just could n't find its parents this movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff but if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please do n't buy it rent it first i'm not saying its a bad movie by any means just a bit empty for me just one more thing the escaflowne series is very very good do n't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series	5
1	you have to be very careful how you apply this product the instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution only then will it work if you use too much you will experience the oil and water effect the other rater stated otherwise this product works very well remember to reapply when you see the effects going away	5
1	i bought this for my wife as a throw in with more expensive items because it was so cheap i actualy forgot i even ordered it until it came in i was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture she is a size small and it fit perfect this not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me the only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up	5
0	i have to be pretty honest i was excited to get this kit but so far i 've been disappointed maybe i'm not getting the whole technique down but i find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it is n't supposed to \( like under my eyes making them look very raccoon y and tired and when wearing smoky eyes i figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect \) maybe i ca n't pull of the look or maybe i'm not applying it correctly but either way it always ends up looking like a big dark glittery mess i'm a big bare escentuals lover but i was disappointed with this product	5

0	this camera is incredibly frustrating i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day the camera takes wonderful pictures however photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light this is not the camera for you the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably since the camera does not have very good image stabilization \( if any \) indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon of course you can use the flash but then your subject will be overlit while the background is pitch dark and forget about taking long range pictures indoors \( i e at a graduation ceremony or wedding \) because if the flash is on you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on if it is off your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for 1 2 seconds since i take alot of indoor pictures this camera is worthless to me if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light this is the camera for you if you want to do any natural light photography forget it	5

1	i was looking specifically for the magic combination of an all around video and still camera that was compact and built very solid that i can travel with easily i have had this camera since dec 19th 2006 i had very bad luck with my previous camera a canon elura that used minidvs when it worked the videos were great but the cassette mechanism kept falling out of adjustment and failing on trips or gatherings and i lost many unrecoverable moments ! i had an extended warranty and sent it back 3 times but they were never able to fix it properly perhaps this was an unusual lemon but i did not want to take the chance again ! of the many media types i 've been told the sd cards are the most durable and almost indestructable i liked the idea of no moving parts for recording videos in addition i was tired of having a separate digital and video camera and the technology has finally arrived to combine the two for the non professional camera person looking to catch candid home and travel shots and videos i 've found this is to be a great little camera it is amazingly small and really will fit in a coat pocket extremely solid it is also a snap to use yet still provides powerful manual override abilities the camera turns on within a few seconds the video colors are extremely natural and not oversaturated in any way and the resolution very fine the microphone works well and of course there is no tape hiss since there is no tape the still photos are of fair quality i printed some at 8 x 10 and they looked decent however if very high quality photos are what you are after this is not the camera for you again this is definitely for the snap and shoot for memories crowd not for people who want to win photography awards the miniscule pop up flash is amazingly powerful i also looked at the sanyo which has a competing sd model with a higher still photo resolution ability but it does not have any motion compensation ability given how small these cameras are it is not possible to hand hold without jiggling it a lot so i ruled the sanyo out okay now the negatives there are quite a few but for what it does i still found this to be the best camera for my purposes \( 1 \) the camera does not record well in low light conditions i'm sure due to the light required for 3ccd color processing and the small size of the lens \( cost of being compact ! \) filming indoors requires pretty good light to ensure decent videos my christmas tree light pictures were disappointing and my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow puppet plays \( 2 \) the cost of buying additional 4gb cards is high and i am worried about misplacing them because they are so small \( 3 \) i experienced wide swings in over and under exposed still photos using the flash although i was \( usually \) able to balance the brightness and contrast with my photo editor i'm sure this is partly due to not being used to the camera yet but the whole idea is not to have to worry about such things flash fill in on backlit subjects works amazingly well \( 4 \) the lcd display on the camera is not synchronized to the same level of brightness and contrast as your tv set or your pc which you will have to adjust upwards during playback thankfully my sony tv allows custom adjustments for each input source ditto when you are creating dvd 's you will need to increase the brightness and contrast to match what you see when playing back a scene through the camera 's own lcd viewer \( 5 \) there is no still photo zoom playback on the camera \( at least i have not found it yet \) frequently i think a snapped photo comes out okay only to realize when zooming the image on the pc to review the details that it is slightly blurry and i need to retake it \( 6 \) you will need to use the included software to view the mpeg2 videos as mpeg2 is not an included driver in the editing tools i 've reviewed \( 7 \) there was no still photo editing software included only video software i supposed panasonic assumes everyone has their own photo editing software already but i did n't my canon photo editing software works for these photos so i am using that \( 8 \) finally the battery fits inside an enclosed compartment so you are not able to buy an extended battery pack since there is no energy required for running a hard drive dvd burner or tape admittedly the batteries seem to last longer before recharging but i still ca n't see taking a trip with less than 2 3 packs i guess i will be spending extra on more batteries ! even with these drawbacks there is no doubt that this is an amazing sleek winner with really no competitor in its class that i intend to use heavily at home and on my travels	5
0	i 've used ms streets and trips for years with minor problems this year i upgraded to a windows vista laptop and wanted the latest software for it i have a gps and i use a pocket pc pda so i need pocket streets after i got home i read the fine print on the box it list support for no higher than the windows xp os but so far the program is running fine on my vista machine the laptop has no serial com ports and s t 2007 wo n't detect a usb port the description of s t 2007 which includes a gps indicates it uses a usb port but apparently it needs the included usb adaptor i could not locate where i could purchase such an adapter s t 2007 no longer ships with pocket streets nor could i locate where i could download a copy i can \( for now \) use my old pocket streets program because 2007 does export pocket street maps finally within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early 90 's the main highway a few blocks from me has only 3 exits in 2 miles yet s t 2007 list over a dozen intersections which means when i get directions i always end up down a dead end road i 've purchase many versions of streets and trips and this is the first time i felt i 've wasted my money open software ca n't be returned from where i purchased it i guess i 'll have to start researching other software packages	5

0	purchased this machine for my wife \( born 1949 \) who has high blood pressure \( 150 90 untreated \) and type ii diabetes had high hopes as this was not a drug related therapy but was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results yes she enjoyed using it but her blood pressure was not improved here is my analysis for your consideration if your high plood pressure is caused by stress and the cares of life resperate may work for you but there is no mechanism by which it can address or cure arteriosclerosis so carefully analyze the cause of your high blood pressure before buying	5

0	this is n't funny it is n't well directed or scripted perhaps it could have been great if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director but it did n't so it turned out mediocre at best unfortunately i believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and i to watch i told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews i 'd read this was going to be a brilliant hilarious cult classic but now that we 've watched it he and i both know better we know it 's dreadful and i can only imagine all the nice things i'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity the only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and i got into halfway through the movie about where we 'd seen one of the actors in the movie before i'm pleased to say i won the argument that was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me in my opinion this is not a 'hilarious cult classic' as others so often describe it i do n't know how drunk i 'd have to be to agree with that assessment of the movie or to find it even a little bit funny but i suspect i would have to get smashed enough that i 'd need a stomach pump afterwards if you want to see a genuinly hilarious cult sci fi classic pick up a copy of flash gordon that has great actors great sets wonderfully campy scripts brilliant humour and a soundtrack by queen furthermore it has stood the test of time and is still great today unlike 'the ice pirates' which has dated really badly better yet get hold of some 'red dwarf' dvds seriously red dwarf is sci fi humour at its best ! it 's so good it will spoil you for other sci fi comedies	5

0	i purchased this blender several months ago and the power of the motor is great but if you make smoothies and crush a lot of ice the plastic carafe will absolutely not hold up to that use mine now leaks all over the base unit even though i 've always washed it by hand and followed the manual 's instructions the waring website says this product is sold with a glass carafe but they do n't sell the glass carafe as a replacement part only the plastic if you think you 're going to crush ice or use the power of the motor you 're going to have big problems with the plastic carafe \( and the replacement plastic carafe is 50 ! ! \) at this point i think i'm going to have to throw out the blender	5

0	maybe it 's just me but i really do n't see the appeal of this movie it 's an incredibly small production \( 3 actors comprise nearly the entire film \) with very low production values norman reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker but alan rickman and polly walker are not at their finest either \( and i am an alan rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie \) if you are an alan rickman fan chances are you 've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them and dark harbor is just one more of these do n't let the promise of a nude scene convince you to buy this movie honestly alan rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on as far as the movie is concerned the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging it is a very dialogue heavy film and the dialogue is not well written enough to carry it off	5

1	i really like this protective cover it is very well made and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the sansa even from a fall the funny thing is that now that it is in the toughskin i am much less likely to drop it before i bought the toughskin the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped now that it is in the case it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure it is true that the buttons are easier to push with the toughskin on than it was without it the hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well the only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than i would expect overall this is an excellent product that i would not hesitate to recommend	5

0	in this film made in uk and luxembourg madeline stowe stars as senga senga and her daughter nat are driving at midnight after visiting nat 's father they bicker the whole trip and it just increases when they stop for a break at a rest stop nat runs away with a mysterious girl who tries and recruits her into a mysterious cult and we are left with a nerve wracked mother doing all she hectically can to retrieve her daughter both the daughter and mother eventually learn that this cult kills people for their blood why they do so is never explained and even at this point when senga is trying to rescue nat she still acts like a brat the last third of the movie seems to just generate more confusion and becomes unbelievable and my main reason for the rating i assigned that good part of the movie has to be attributed to the direction not the wirtting the movie is dark and suspenseful though you do not know what really is transpiring in this movie it does keep you on the edge of the seat as senga tries to rescue her daughter	5
1	print magazines are behind current news by about 3 4 months the websites have news about new digital cameras instantenously the print magazines are destined to be 3 4 months behind if you are looking for the latest news you will get them tape delayed if you only read magazines however this magazine goes more in depth than some other popular magazines the reviews are actually 4 5 pages long not one page politically correct recaps of the feature lists \( still nowhere near as technical as the web reviews \) having said all that and understanding the limitations of print magazines this is a good affordable magazine to read if you are interested in digital photography it has some useful and helpful information reasonable reviews and some interesting articles	5
1	so if it 's such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating \? well it 's a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating and it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me they physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so but everything else is great about it graphics are great not excellent but great sound is great too gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed kinda on the easy side in normal level though but i guess nothing is perfect go ahead and get this one it 's worth what it costs	5

1	after all the hype on line about the t amp i had to check it out for myself all the reports are true ! this is one hot little audio amp which can not be touched for the price if you have a portable audio device and two speakers you need to drive with it this amp is for you you will not be disappointed i recommend purchasing the ac power supply as well you can find others cheaper but the recommended one works perfectly and insures the warrantee for the t amp remains valid	5
1	i enjoyed this movie some of the reviewers do n't understand this was not a documentary on the bambino this was a movie the fine gentlemen p b pereira attempt to dismiss john goodman as a somewhat successful star from the late 80 's is idiotic and off the mark you sir are taking the whole movie too seriously babe 's rough and tumble upbringing left its mark on him goodman is terrific throughout the movie i really fell for the lovely trini alvarado who plays babe 's first wife she is stunning as far as the would have could ofs and other wild speculation on how good babe would have been think about this babe did n't use illegal steroids like today 's ball players he rode a train not a jet fitness equipment did not exist in addition the old ball parks tended to have greater distances from the plate to the fence i highly recommend this movie if for just the pull my finger line	5

1	yes there are tons of great shots in the mag great articles \( in french only \) contests very chic however customer service will treat you like the redheaded stepchild when you ask them why have you not sent me the latest issue of photo \? \? and you know it will happen they only send you sporadic issues when they feel like it \( or so it would seem \) most issues are available on the stand weeks before you get yours delivered via mail \( should it be the other way around \? \? \? \) and they wont give you a courtesy letter postcard telling you when your subscription is up that 's for you to figure out so if you can deal with the lame french hold music when you call photo 's cutomers service constantly this is a great magazine cough cough vive la france !	5

0	would n't you think that the manufacturers of a wine rack would measure the bottles of wine before designing the rack \? apparently not in this case after purchasing 3 of these racks i discovered that about 10 of my 200 bottle collection does n't fit in the grid holes it was understood that magnums were n't going to fit which was no big deal but when over 20 bottles end up sitting on the floor because they are about 1 8 to 1 4 too large in diameter i get a little irritated especially after paying over 300 including shipping the overall quality of the product is average the racks were not straight along their length and had to be tie wired together to keep them in alignment	5

1	it 's a great manual pump but it 's just a manual pump after all manually pumping both breasts one at a time takes more than twice as long as double electric pumping to get the same amounts of milk it would be impossible for me to keep pumping at work if i had to take that much time out of every work day however i do keep this pump in my desk drawer for emergencies \( like the time i forgot my other pump at home \) or for out of office meetings \( because it 's small and discrete \) it 's also great for occasional home use or for women who need to leave the house with a pump every once in a while i'm giving it 4 stars because i do n't think it should be advertized for use at a full time job	5

1	this ramp set is just one heck of an item traction is great and if wanted each of the three ramps can be used alone or all held together by an easily removable rubber hinge system i like the ramp because it can be used with small wheel products like a lawn mower track machines like a snow thrower or even as a great loading platform for my road king motorcycle i recommend that the 77 length set be purchased if you can store them easily because of the hinged attach platform to the vehicle and easier load angle enjoy ! !	5
0	while one of the other reviewers states that it only works on some types of champagne bottles i could n't get it to work at all i tried it on two different shapes of bottles but to no avail the problem is that the ring that is supposed to slide down the neck to secure the stopper does n't slide when it 's on the bottle when off the bottle the mechanism works fine it appears to me that the stopper must be made for a specific bottle and not for most champagne bottles in general at least that was my experience i found a good 3 00 stopper at sur la table that works just fine and is not dependent on the shape of the champagne bottle it does n't have the fancy pour spout but at least it keeps the bubbles in the champagne	5

0	the next generation is basically a remake of the original texas chainsaw massacre in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical though different characters and locations are used the original was a little overrated in my opinion and this remake is quite frankly terrible bad acting with the exception of renee zellweger and matthew mcconaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several b movie actors the only major differences from the original are that leatherface now dresses as a woman which was fairly amusing but hardly essential and a tacked on conspiracy theory the conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous i wo n't explain it theres no point watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends i would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though even die hards admit its awful i only gave it 2 stars because i reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst \( yes even worse than this ! \)	5

1	fable is easily one of the greatest games to ever be released the story of a boy who grows up to become a hero and still wants revenge for the tragedy of his past it is compelling and very entertaining the gameplay is excellent it 's not your typical rpg since this plays like an action adventure game i love how you can choose to be good or bad and the choices you make reflect on what your character looks like the game also plays like real life you can get married divorced have sex and buy houses even decorate them ! the game is so real that you can choose to be straight gay or bi sexual depending on who you sleep with the only thing that is missing is that you ca n't have children but that should change in future installments another cool thing about the game is that the more evil you get the more people are afraid of you but the more of a hero and savior you become you are greeted with praise and clapping in every town you go to overall this game is a must have ! ! ! the replay value is extremely high i have played and beat the game many times and i'm still not tired of it ! if you love rpgs or hate rpgs this is still fantastic i ca n't wait until fable 2 is released which is currently being completed get this it is simply amazing !	5

1	i love this story for my boys it is now a story i put on for my grandson it keeps their attention and there is always something going on i do wish that the few cuss words that were put in this movie had been ommitted you should explain that this has nothing to do with your religous beliefs it is really entertaining i love the bird and i love the song bright eyes i would recommed this for anyone 8 and up i do n't think girls care for it as much as boys	5
0	sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie but peter sellers did many better films than this dr strangelove was the masterpiece being there is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in washington the world of henry orient \( at last on dvd ! \) is priceless but virtually unknown with delicious performances from sellers and especially his teenage tormentors finally the pink panther series is much better slapstick than after the fox which has many famous talented participants but is mostly silly unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as clouseau co one irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations as if we might not notice them otherwise i agree with other reviewers that victor mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted and martin balsam does okay with his stuff too when watching this film i kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant i could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money	5
1	has insightful articles about what 's hot in the business world great articles on tech companies and wonderful ideas about how to get rich honestly the best thing about this magazine is that it gives an immense amount of motivation and inspiration to the reader i would agree with one of the reviewers however that it tends to go off course it has great potential and is definitely worth subscribing to	5

1	this is the second elder scrolls game i 've played the first being oblivion i really enjoyed oblivion and decided to give this one a try and i must say i 've really enjoyed it so far still on the main quest though right now i'm gonna join the morag tong now first off if you 're an impatient type or really easily confused then this game is not for you this game takes time and patience to really enjoy one thing i did when i first started playing i paid attention to what people said and went where i was told to go i know it 's a game that really gives you freedom to do what you want but for someone just starting out on the series just follow the main quest line and make sure to pay attention to what people say and just go where you need to then once you 've become more accustomed to how things work then i 'd suggest exploring some you 'll often come across people on the roads with quests they 'll want to give you that 'll often deviate from your current objective i would actually suggest helping them out as the journal is often enough to get you back on track afterwards just remember to stay on the roads and look at every sign you come across so you know which way to go in closing if you have patience and are willing to put some serious time into the game then i 'd suggest getting this it 's an older game and the graphics are clearly outdated but it can be quite an enjoyable experience in fact i'm liking it more than oblivion which had my attention for a few months no telling when i 'll be done with this one	5
0	the buttons do n't have that clicky button feel so you press and you 're like did it go \? the labels are hard to read icons take a little figuring out honestly i use it for turning on off and if i want to do anything else i go up to the ihome to adjust it	5
0	very disappointed in the watch and amazon the day date did not work on delivery but i was unaware of it until the end of february when i tried to manually change the date i found that it was broken at that time about a week after i received the watch the day date did change automatically each night amazon refused t orepalce it because i had the band adjusted seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3 4 weeks ! had i purchased it from a reputable local store i could have exchanged it for a new watch	5
0	this game has a 25 minute introduction or story square enix was really creative and the stories are so good ! however i do expect them to put something like skip intro cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories ! i however only get a game every five months so i am fine with that this is only a minor flaw another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears very annoying but again a minor flaw this game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again ! it get very boring after awhile you have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker this game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters there is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle 1 0 3 5 terrible3 6 5 bad5 1 6 5 average6 6 8 good8 1 9 great9 1 10 must buy excellent ! graphics 9 10 greatsound 9 10 some voice acting but greatfun 5 10 depends on how patient you are and how you react to battling the same monster over and over againaverage about 8my grade 7 goo	5
1	wow ! ! ! this game is so freaking cool ! ! ! the colossi are amazing ! i 've played my share of games and i can honestly say that i 've never encountered creatures like these before i'm only about halfway thru the game \( having slain 7 colossi with 9 more yet to go \) and yet each new colossus that i meet astounds me all over again one thing about them that i have never felt in other games is that they envoke sympathy towards them until you find them in their own little area of their world they are just giant hulks resting peacefully bothering no one but once disturbed they awaken and you must figure out how to take each one down i actually feel sad when they fall supposedly your character must take them down to resurrect his lifeless lover however i get a sense that there will be a twist to this story before it ends another equally awe inspiring aspect of this game is the environment in which you are playing it is without compare the most beautiful mystical unbelievably gorgeous landscape i 've seen in any game ever the world looks feels and sounds like an ancient place and time you just have to experience it this will be one of those games i 'll remember years from today and will have to play all over again this game is a work of art just as certain films are plus it 's just so freaking cool ! ! ! do n't miss it	5
1	i have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts all in all pretty pleased with the purchase it was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my ipod mini there are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models panicked at first because they did n't have one for the mini but it was already installed on the model cons light dimmer has three settings but even the lowest is too bright you can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote no ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week for example 7 00am monday to friday no alarm on weekends wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset \( by you \) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle sound is great for an alarm clock do n't think it will compare with a mini stereo or bose sounddock would buy again at the price	5

1	gene watson was one of the finest voices in country music and this compilation of 18 hits provide a fine sampling of that voice considered by some to be hard country i find gene watson to have a more pop oriented voice that combined well with his selection of songs and in the '70 's that proved to be enough to keep him on the charts while many of the songs on this album are pure country others are the typical drab 70 's pop that filled the void between the nashville sound and the new traditional era of the 80 's in any case there is no doubt that gene watson earned his spot in country music and this collection carries those hits that made him the household name he is today including his signature songs farewell party and love in the hot afternoon if you prefer the more traditional country sound his you could know as much about a stranger and should i come home are also included	5

1	my dad got this for me to supplement a latin textbook i have been studying for my high school language course it is quick and easily understandable you get plenty of words and phrases which is perfect for a traveler if you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it not travel however you 'd better get a book to supplement this it does n't teach about pluralization verb conjugation or other oddities that the language holds such as in latin the ending m which implies a direct object the latin cd also does not use the dashes over the vowels \( ie \) overall i am very happy with the product and with the price of 39 99 \( usd \) but i am also quite glad i have my textbook \( ecce romani \) to go with it	5

1	first i want to make a slight correction to the previous reviewer 's text the size weight of the gloves does n't change according to the size of your hand but rather to the size of you the user of the gloves if you are an average sized male you will be hard pressed to find a sparring partner if you only have 10oz gloves nobody in their right minds would agree to spar with you because with such small gloves the risk of injuring the receiver of the blows goes way up hence 16oz is the standard size for sparring gloves women can use 14oz and children 14oz and 12oz depending on how big they are the point with heavier bigger gloves is to protect your training partner anyway on with the review these are good all around sparring gloves their over all quality is quite good and even the velcros are done well so you could use these for thai boxing as well without scratching your partner 's neck and shoulders when clinching however i found that when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend to come through a bit so they 're not the safest gloves around still they are good enough for pretty much anybody who 's looking for a good pair of gloves for sparring i recommend that you get a separate pair of bag gloves or 10oz gloves for bag and mitt work since hitting the heavy bag and focus mitts harden the leather which again makes the gloves more dangerous to use in sparring remember to wrap your hands and wrists when hitting the heavy bag in order to avoid knuckle wrist and shoulder injuries everlast is a good company and for the most part they make quality products these gloves do what they are supposed to do	5
1	there 's a reason everyone loves this game there 's a lot of exciting action ! the popularity of this game is well deserved too because you can do so many things in this game that it 's almost ridiculous driving around is a blast and the many weapons you can use such as shovels baseball bats golf clubs pistols and shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun and revolutionary game it 's a game you have to own if you 're a fan of video games	5

1	i definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game unfortunately that absolutely is n't always the case one of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80 's was super password with bert convy the game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle this edition does n't reflect on that edition this board game edition is a example of the original password with the late allen ludden the game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually have n't seen the original password like myself but it is just delightful unfortunately it is n't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the bert convy edition hopefully when password is remade it will be just like the themed 80 's edition of the nbc game show price b game c 1 2 fun enjoyment b overall c	5
0	an anti catholic newspaper in a catholic town \( this peculiar quality of the paper existed long before the priest child sex abuse scandal in the area \) whether you are a catholic or not the paper 's anti catholic bias makes one wonder why it has such an ax to grind and wonder too if the paper does not hold other prejudices its factual reporting often times reads more like editorials it has elitist pretensions without the quality to back them up i live in the boston area and am exasperated with the globe i prefer reading the new york times	5

0	the good when i first heard about this board i was incredibly excited i have been playing bf2 \( battlefield 2 \) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys so it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game the interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing the first that i have seen but the price for each is kind of high but well worth it the bad the board is constructed well but do n't expect this to replace your home keyboard the windows keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run of the mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with \( i might be biased since i have a msoft ergonomic split keyboard \) in game typing is difficult at best \( with the gaming keysets \) with most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1 2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1 2 side they are all vertical \( not staggered like u j and m keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other \) the keys feel a little cheap when you push them down they do n't bounce back as much the ugly about 2 weeks after i purchases this board \( and the bf2 keyset \) 9 keys went completely dead i tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of windows xp to no avail i contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that i have a faulty base unit duh ! they are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day maybe this post is premature but i do n't think i am getting a new base unit conclusion the expression great idea bad execution holds true here my opinion do n't buy this board ideazon has too many issues not enough support staff and a website that does n't do anything but look good	5

0	it 's not just that if lucy fell is a bad film 90 of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer director star eric schaeffer 's nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday 's roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he 's cute speaks volumes	5
0	i'm sorry i wasted the money i can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it i'm not squeamish by nature but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims but animals as well three quarter 's way through when i realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end i started skipping these parts \( which got me to the last page quite quickly \) i was bored and disgusted with the author i believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages in the end my eyeballs got six pack abs from rollng around so much this book is going on my do not lend shelf as i value my friends and would n't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense	5

1	eddie and rose are meant to be in nicole savoca 's dogfight this is a warm and wonderful movie those of us who have seen it have an obligation to spread the word to as many others as we can it 's sad that so few people have heard of or seen dogfight how a film that was so universally well liked by viewers and critics managed to completely slip under the radar of popular attention is a mystery to me many others have synopsized the story so i wont be repetitive i will say that this movie 's genius is in its acting river phoenix and lili taylor have the chemistry of childhood friends and it shows in scene after scene river gives the most endearing performance of his career in this film as the affectedly coarse absurdly young jarhead eddie about to ship out to vietnam his coming of age is the narrative behind this movie while rose 's idealism and grace throughout the humiliating ordeal of the dogfight make her character angelic the poignancy of the closing scene in which eddie embraces rose in tears after having lost his three best friends during the vietnam war will stay with you for a long time dogfight is a unique and touching film it harkens to a sensibility which is dissatisfied with much of the droll offered as romantic by hollywood today	5

0	this is definitely not a bad collection but there are so many better ones out there that this should not be your first choice the song sweet emotion has been completely destroyed on this album the entire bass intro has been cut out and the song starts about an entire minute into it there really is no reason to do this as even on the radio they play the entire thing as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long the song starts at a terrible place too it sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song then just stuck it on the cd that way again not a terrible compilation but definitely not a good first choice	5

0	i bought this premium priced product because it has both built in voice mail and speakerphone the latter was the key feature i sought well it works intermittently just enough so you can tell \( occasionally \) that it 's on but infrequently enough that you ca n't actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation it reminds me of the can you hear me now commercials i 'd rather live with courtney than own this piece of junk one more day ! all the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well ugh do not buy this product ! !	5

0	this book is a place to start at best the main part of middle eastern cook that i find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices this book calls for dried spices at times the dishes do n't produce the food that i remember eating growing up with my family the book is not a total loss however the spinach pies are acceptable there are many other books out there that i would recommend first	5
0	this film has been re released as meltdown there are a few reasons for watching this movie 1 \) jet li 2 \) chingmy yau \( the reporter \) 3 \) wu ma \( frankie 's dad \) 4 \) a decent fight scene at the end jacky cheung is also not as aggravating as usual that 's it jet li has appeared in three or four films directed by wong jing and just as chow yun fat does in god of gamblers and jackie chan does in city hunter he does what he can the direction of the film however \( as well as gog and ch \) stinks the plot copies die hard and speed with some broad satire aimed at jackie chan but that is not the problem put simply jackie chan knows how to direct a film wong jing does not if you want to see jet li go see fist of legend once upon a time in china or just about anything else he has done if you want to see a good hong kong action movie watch films directed by john woo ringo lam tsui hark jackie chan and sammo hung jet li is fun to watch but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this	5

0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	5

0	i have watched this movie along with many other jet li films to be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection i was so caught up in the title that i really was expecting much more from the film but i was very disappointed to say the least the movie takes place in the early eighties when gangs dressed in leather with chains carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally this was not the type of movie that i was expecting jet li to be in if you want some real action packed jet li pick up the contract killer which will give you alot more for your money trust me you want be disappointed	5

0	this is a nice looking wallet but the internal design leaves something to be desired there is an internal flap used for credit cards etc that makes the wallet too thick even if you do n't fill it with cards i am tempted to cut it out \( it is stitched to the inside \) to make the wallet less cumbersome the credit card slots are also too tight so you have to pry the cards in and out and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards there is a nice display for your license with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed \( it is also in a tight slot \)	5

1	my husband and i recently went to florida to see his mother in the hospital she had suddenly become ill as we waited for her prognosis we went to several local grocery stores to try to locate drake 's funny bones which my husband considered a comfort food that his mother would always get for him when he would visit we looked to no avail unfortunately his mother passed away the next day we headed home to arizona and the first thing i did was try to find out how to get some of these snack cakes i knew that it would mean so much for him to have them if anything out of remembrance of his mother i located gristedes through amazon and was so excited the package arrived today unfortunately i was at work when my fianc notified me and i sat with him on the phone while he opened his surprise both of our eyes filled with tears and you could hear the cry in his voice when he realized what it was he said it was the best gift that he had ever received thank you for allowing him to have a little extra tribute to his mom for christmas time	5

1	we love this game we were first introduced to it at our children 's preschool where it fast became a favorite at free choice time the children engaged in it delightfully and playfully everyone has fun the game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was i worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were better at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged but have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school the board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for it is a challenge even for us big kids i would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game	5
0	this game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes also if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again it 's a huge waste of money for 30 00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the dvd or have more than one dvd included in the game this is a big disapointment	5
1	i received this for christmas from my amazon wishlist i wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing i was a long time user of norelco shavers but switched to a blade since i could n't get a close enough shave now that the whiskers are mostly gray you ca n't tell for a few days if i shaved or not so closeness is no longer an issue i typically use this shaver in the shower and have noticed that if you wash your face first it takes more of the cool skin creme to give a smooth close shave just a hint guys for the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles dimples and adam 's apple cleanly with very little drag my only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the 'stash sideburns while showering small complaint that does n't remove any ratings stars all in all a great shaver	5
1	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	5

0	my mom was a subscriber to newsweek for years and i 'd flip through her copies most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be \( although not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail so much for protecting our freedoms \) anyway since newsweek is beholden to big business advertisements it wo n't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns if people are interested in more honest more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world \( the neoliberalism of the us empire and other wealthy nations \) then i 'd recommend z magazine i 'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it 's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize z also publishes articles and interviews with the most cited living author on the planet noam chomsky \( another figure i'm sure the us soldier thinks should be in jail although chomsky recently spoke at west point so even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings \)	5

1	born in steventon hampshire in 1775 jane austen was one of two daughters of the reverent george austen and his wife cassandra she was educated in oxford and in southampton finally attending a boarding school in the abbey gatehouse in reading berkshire the environment provided by her home was conducive to writing and she often enacted plays for her family something that gave her the opportunity to present her stories and develop the characters in depth jane austen 's works are imaginative full of emotion and depicting relationships that transcend time jane austen wrote about society about propriety and about etiquette she was highly critical of the snobbery with which the upper classes kept away from others her study of human flaws and prsonal relationships provide great material for the development of her characters jane austen wrote pride and prejudice in 1813 and it still enchants audiences all over the world the first time i read this book i read as a child back in cuba orgullo y prejuicio the writings of jane austen shaped my perception of true love as i identified with the love between elizabeth bennet and her one and only mr darcy with this bbc adaptation completed in 1996 i have been able to relive the experience of exposing myself to a classic one of the best books ever written with this bbc miniseries we feel as though we were reading the book for the adaptation faithfully follows the author 's writing the filming is magnificent offering us a view of gorgeous scenery magnificent castles and locations that bring the book to life for we can see what we expected after reading the book the love story presents the struggle of the times as two individuals fall in love regardless of class differences or status and yet the antagonism and friction created as a result of said differences darcy is a wealthy single man who upon meeting the family of elizabeth boisterous non polished and simple believes her to be beneath him the meet at a dance where his best friend falls in love with elizabeth sister but darcy thinks he knows jane 's heart not to be true to these emotions elizabeth overhears a conversation during the dance and feels insulted by the proud and distant darcy keeping her distance and yet without her awareness falling in love with him jane austen is masterful at creating enough tension to keep us all in suspense as to the path these lives will take as some members of elizabeth family make the wrong choices the dialogue is almost verbatim to the book making this series a true delight for those of us who identify with this work jennifer ehle as elizabeth and colin firth as darcy provide magnificent interpretations of this timeless classic keeping us all dreaming of ever encountering love of this magnitude in our lives as with most dvds that we own we watch by selecting english subtitles which enhances the viewing by allowing us not to miss a single word said by the characters who would want to miss a single word in this marvel of the english language \? there is a documentary as an additional bonus where interviews with cast members are included simply awesome ! interviewed are jennifer ehle elizabeth colin firth darcy we also get to see those who played mary bennet lucy briers mr collins david bamber mr bingley crispin bonham carter and mr wickham adrian lukis	5

1	yes ben witherington is a \( relative \) conservative but do n't hold that against him yes he has strong opinions but do n't hold that against him either because they are well argued the fact remains that this is the best overview of quot third quest quot jesus scholarship i have been able to find admirers of the jesus seminar may not appreciate his critique but it is very fair and well thought out one of the benefits from a book like this besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research is that the different views of jesus can help one achieve a well rounded portrait of the savior no one scholar gets it right all the time \( not even witherington with his own view of jesus as god 's wisdom \) but the different insights are valuable because jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend that should be a cause for humility \( something some jesus scholars have lacked at least in print \) i highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary jesus scholarship	5

0	i have just bought the sony cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and i have only taken 30 40 pictures i loved it and then it just stopped working so i recharged the baterry no luck still the camera would n't turn off or on so thankfully i had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again no it does n't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off basically worthless it seems like it might have short circuited but i was so excitted to buy this camera i read all instructions before use i have n't let anyone else use it and it has n't been out of my sight never been dropped never in extreme hot or cold always well protected so i am going to try to return it or exchange it i am hoping to get good service or i will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30 40 pictures hopefully i can let you know if they stand by their products before now i have always been happy with what i have bought from amazo	5

1	this film is a landmark in blending science and advocacy it seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives not unlike our own but it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity it avoids going too far into the subjective it does n't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute stagey displays of animal interaction instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments but by the sheer genious of editing and writing one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama the movie wisely lets the animals' behavior do the talking and does n't try to push the viewers' judgement one way or the other it left me rethinking everything i had assumed about animals emotions and the nature of our \( and by 'our' i mean all of god 's creatures \) existence	5
0	i purchased this toy for my 3yr old in december last year he has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find any products \( discs carrying case etc \) for the videonow i have called the company several times everything is always unavailable and i do check on a regular basis my son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it it was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired if you make a product make sure that there are enough discs it is simply a waste of money and time i cannot continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week i hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy	5
0	i ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback we followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee after that the machine said ventilate we followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself went to make another cup of coffee and it said ventilate this time it would not fix itself i tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray turn off the knob and ventilate comes back up on the screen turn the machine off and turn it back on ventilate came up on the screen we called amazon and they sent us a replacement a few days later \( thank you amazon \) unfortunately this one i did not get cup one out of the machine it read ventilate as soon as i turned it on the difference is with this one no water would come out at all gaggia provides no customer support so you are on your own with this unit	5
1	great quality well made and best results with amazon thanks and five stars brav	5
1	as far as wireless bridges go this item is expensive some can be had for 40 50 at other sites but those items are a seperate item with another plug and would require more space this adapter is designed to work perfectly with the the 360 and does just that it connects to the back of the console \( and hd dvd drive if you purchase that \) and use the power of the 360 it does n't take up any extra space and has a strong connection i would recommend it to anyone that has a wireless network in their home	5

1	i am 62 years old and seen them all i have never seen anyone as visually and emotionally stunning as beth hart at the paradiso ! simply the most powerful stage performance i have ever witnessed ! she takes every single song to an epic level of entertainment and just plain never coasts through a song some of the spectators in attendance looked almost scared by what they were seeing and most were mesmerized by her on stage and off stage sexually potent antics ! she has been compared to janis i saw janis twice and beth hart would bury janis in any category ! i ca n't imagine how she can possibly maintain a level like that captured at the paradiso for very long it just does n't seem humanly possible ! i am so glad someone was there with so highly skilled a video crew to capture one of the most shattering evenings of music ever magnificent in its fury !	5

0	i 've used printmaster 12 platinum on dvd and liked it well enough but the disk wore out i knew from reviews of subsequent versions that broderbund was giving us less and less but even still i was stunned by just how much less where are all the projects \? even counting the online projects there just is n't much here for anyone for kid 's masks version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2 ! the cards are terrible many are just small clipart images with a white background \( at least you wo n't need much ink \) in short if you want to create anything decent you 'll have to design it yourself inspired by the one nice looking cut out card i was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that i would be pleased to send	6

0	i registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn i thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse well the first time i used this it took more time to set it up than i did using it also the button on the shower head is hard to press and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom \( found that out the hard way \) when you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick my daughter does love the spa effect but i think she prefers warm water throughout her bath the one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it i have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out needless to say i had to purchase another insert for the tub which does n't fit very well so im a bit irritated overall this is a good idea it needs some kinks worked out of it just not worth 40 so now im off to target to purchase a new tub	6
0	i can attest to the author 's views because i too have precognition telepathy and remote viewing ability for example right now i see the author counting his income from the book and laughing at the gullibility of new age readers	6

1	i 've been a chef for almost 15 years and a knife is one of the tools i reach out most of the time during those years i 've used all kinds of brands including kershaw wusthof mundial and even smart and final brand and to be more specific an 8 inch chef 's knife is my favorite after having fun with these toys i thought it 's time to reward myself with an ultimate gift so i sought after a kind of blade that could be totally distinctive one day i came across the shun classic on the amazon web this knife sets itself apart from the others the simplicity in design the beauty of the blade the sharpness and finally its steel quality the blade has some kind of a pattern as a result from layers of steel which is said to be the same steel that is used to make a samurai 's sword wow ! the d shaped handle is made of dark coated hardwood it fits in my hand nicely but the most stunning thing of all is the sharpness i can slice pieces of lemons micro thin ! it 's not only super sharp but it also holds the edge sharpness much longer than other steels i experienced with it weighs a little heavier but i'm sure that 's not a big deal for me cleaning up the knife after use is a breeze because there is n't any corner which will accumulate grease shun 8 inch classic is the best i 've ever had you wo n't regret what you pay for even though the price is very high a good chef deserves a good steel	6
1	black metropolis is perhaps the founding document of african american studies a classic work of sociology that still resonates today it is a paradigmatic expression of the chicago school of sociology however a school that today stands in some disrepute at least in some circles indirectly it was the target of james baldwin 's famous attack on richard wright in his essay everybody 's protest novel the claim of the criticism has been that the chicago school due to its insistance upon using a quot scientific approach quot merely reproduces the very terms under which african americans have been oppressed a claim that has proceeded under the warrant of european intellectuals such as theodor adorno still black metropolis is a landmark study and unfortunately many if not most of its observations and conclusions remain true today and in fact it could be argued that conditions in the black belt of chicago have gotten worse not better since 1945 the year of black metropolis' publication which lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above though perhaps it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of the chicago school as they are criticisms of american society since then as we know we have witnessed a great shift in american public opinion away from what some consider to be the excesses of those days so much so in fact that the work of black metropolis may again be regarded as a profoundly useful book embodying american liberalism as it does which counted as a grave sin thirty years ago black metropolis may possibly be due for a fresh look	6
1	ahh the tekken series probably the most influential series of 3d fighting games outside of the virtua fighter games tekken 5 is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre with the 4th game just a distance memory this takes the series forward \( or back depending on how you look at things \) tekken 5 uses the tried and trusted tekken gameplay while still making everything feel fresh characters that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones are now fully fleshed out with moves of their own anna williams for example is now not a clone of her sister nina when people mention tekken they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their 'mad skillz' as it were making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre this i think is far from the truth tekken 5 welcomes new and veterans to the series alike whereas button bashing pretenders to tekken 's crown coughdeadoralivecough leave you feeling somewhat cold tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play yes tekken 5 has its button bashing characters but every single character is unique and how unique they look ! arguably the best looking ps2 game to date with gorgeous backdrops fluid realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next gen console music wise it 's back to form mix between techno dance we 've come to know and love from tekken the least we say about tekken 4 's music the better ! you 've got your usual story mode to run through with each character to see why they 've entered the tournament etc but this 5th edition borrows the human ai mode of virtua fighter 4 this has replaced the arcade mode in name and pits you against humans who have uploaded downloaded their data from the tekken arcade machine from all over the world it 's a welcome challenge even though it does n't even compare to facing a real life human opponent all in all this is the true homecoming of a master easily the best tekken to date and probably the best 3d fighter in existence though i am partial to abit of soul calibur heh	6

1	first off i need to tell you that i 've carried a swiss knife since i was a kid i have most of the styles but this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason for me since i do n't fish i found more uses for this in the most unexpected area the fish scaler tool is one that i would never use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly too much work but this tool i have used more than any other on all my knives i 've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights pick locks to measure things \( something you need more often than you think \) to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it 's perfect to scratch those areas one ca n't reach that 's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which i use except for the absurd parcel hook this tool is useless and yet victorinox continues to install it on many knives the only useful task i 've found for the hook is to tighten one 's laces on my boots when i snow shoe anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook \? please post it if you have	6

0	i can not stand this book i ca n't even finish reading it kevin j anderson can not write original star wars books at all the only thing i have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the dark lords of the sith comic book everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story he seems to have some obsession with death stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those darksaber jedi search dark apprentice champions of the force heck even the ig 88 story he wrote for tales of the bounty hunters had the death star tied in \( ig 88 transfers himself into the death star what the heck \? \) seriously this book is not worth it try timothy zahn or michael stackpole at least they do n't always use death stars and while zahn 's last 3 books are based around thrawn the original heir to the empire dark force rising and the last command when thrawn first appeared was not him dry humping the same concept over and over	6
0	having read a few bosch books already \( the closers and lost light \) i realized that i should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how bosch became the bosch i was reading in the later series however i was very disappointed with this book one of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors \( mispellings and such \) i found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages \( before i stopped reading \) ! i thought it was ironic that connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book also i found the book to be too gritty it lacked the emotion and soul that i found in the later books it seemed that connelly was trying too hard to make bosch fit this certain mold but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that i read so it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because i just finished reading the narrows and loved it and will probably pick up some other bosch books and just read it out of order connelly 's writing seems to be getting better and better which should explain why i did n't enjoy this book and could n't finish it i gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe i was too impatient this is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order	6
0	this book is a cure for insomnia if i ever have trouble falling to sleep i 'll just dig out my old flatland book and i 'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later ! listening to the a square character telling us about his flat two dimensional world is not thought provoking its just confusing ! trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing i mean i understand what flatland would be like but only after i carefully think out what mr square is saying i spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of flatland than i do enjoying the story not very interesting at all even two stars is being generous	6

0	they spend the first half of this movie saying how great the ultimate warrior was the journey is awesome ! then all of the sudden the paid wwe guys just began to bad mouth the warrior maybe he did have questionable judgment but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved \? they take some very low blows they say that the warrior was a bad wrestler actually he seemed just fine to me when i was young and i really ca n't distinguish one 's ability from the other they just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations vince says quickly that the reason why the ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test as soon as he says this they fade to black then come back with a new issue what drug use \? which drugs \? presumably they 're talking about steroids but what about that high and mighty hulk hogan with his admitted drug use let 's not talk about that let 's just keep ganging up on the warrior they completely ridicule him changing his name to the warrior and they also just try to badmouth him so much who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him \? i do n't ! he excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him including hulk and oh yeah they do n't even let the warrior defend himself why did i have to find out from imdb com that he was asked to appear but declined \? why do n't they address this \? this docu is more slanted than fahrenheitt 911 every wrestling and ultimate warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it it just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking	6
0	when your infant is crying because he 's hungry and you 're only thinking about how you want to be back in bed you will not necessarily hear the very quiet click another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit did it already cycle through once \? twice \? i do n't know i never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and i was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out yes it was in plain sight but that doesnt mean i caught it at the right time what i do know is that leaving the bottle in there reagrdless of it being 4oz or 8oz makes the formula very hot even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby this went in the trash the only reason i gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if i waited for water to boil otherwise i just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem	6
0	i'm not sure what compelled me to seek out americano written and directed by kevin noland it 's not as if i was dying to check up on the career of joshua jackson a star of tv 's dawson 's creek perhaps i was intrigued by dennis hopper 's inclusion in such a small scale production i mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar here however the lure for him seems to have been his daughter ruthanna who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film maybe it was international star leonor varela a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in america most likely though it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of spain with great scenery bull fights hemingway hard drinking and partying the running of the bulls the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing however i am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film i think noland has talent and i look forward to other works the film is photographed well and has good performances my problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming of age story with an astounding lack of real character insight this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat the setup is simple as recent college graduates jackson and two pals \( who bicker comically \) are spending the last few days of their vacation in spain before jackson must return to the real world and a new job facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood work and independence freedom and monotony dreams and reality jackson falls into lust with a local played by varela should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance \? should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure \? should he stay in spain \? these are legitimate questions and a legitimate albeit familiar story path what makes americano so tedious and uninvolving however is that the film does n't allow you to know its characters a character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off and americano does n't succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation we never know anything about jackson 's job or life in america or his dreams passions interests etc aside from this fleeting romance sure the film goes through the requisite motions jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of hemingway what else would you expect in spain \? if he has artistic aspirations however the screenplay surely never develops this lacking any real guidance as to what jackson envisions for his life i simply fell into the camp of who cares \? there are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of spanish culture dennis hopper 's role however as a club host is a complete misfire ultimately though my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth sure jackson 's at a crossroads but lacking any understanding of what he wants it made no difference to me what he chose sorry but that 's a big problem when it is your film 's central theme kgharris 02 07	6
1	you need to be old enough to look at a set of several horse cards and decide which kind of horse show a particular hose would do best in and which horse you would get the most points for if you had that particular horse compete in a dressage show jumper show ect points are added up and who evers horse earned the most points wins that horse show and that player gets to keep the cards so i would say ages 8 to 12 but younger children could play with help from someone who can read and add up numbers there is a limited amount of rounds in a game since there is a limited number of cards to play for each horse show so the game last around 15 minutes or so i like this part a lot since games like war chomp can go on forever it does take a table top to play the game i originally purchased the game for my daughter thinking she could play it on the bus with a friend but you need to have a surface to lay out some cards i quess you could try to squeeze them onto a larger text book laid onto your lap but it would n't be easy	6

1	do n't hesitate to buy this grill ! ! ! ! for the past few years i 've been switching back and forth between my gas grill and my good ole weber kettle grill like everyone else i prefer grilling over charcoal so this seemed like the perfect grill for me i was right ! this grill takes all the pain away from grilling with charcoal one push of a button and 15 minutes later i am grilling ribeyes yes ! it is that simple the chimney revolutionized how i grilled with charcoal but this is 10 times better than that the propane ignition rocks the work area is great the lid holder is a nice addition and the water proof charcoal holder is more convenient than i thought it would be let us not forget it has a dual purpose thermometer ! it took me about 40 minutes to assemble but that 's to be expected oh yeah i ordered it on monday and it was delivered on thursday	6

0	do n't get me wrong i'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing i'm just really miffed at the fact that splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it 24 grams per cup ! ! they get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp which is 0 5g would you believe that in 0 5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate ! \? no way ! ! the sweetener sucralose is not a carbohydrate but since it 's 600x as sweet as sugar they need to bulk it up to make it measure like sugar but all the maltodextrin they use for filler is carbohydrates this could really screw up somebody on atkins' induction phase for example the day before i learned this i made some kool aid with splenda i did n't know that in 2 quarts i was drinking down 24 carbs ! what to do \? find somebody online who sells liquid sucralose they use water as the filler it 's super concentrated still and it truly has 0 carbs i look forward to the day when mcneil nutritionals meets the demand for zero carb splenda \( that 's 0 0g not 0 49g !	6

1	let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect it is in fact flawed as you may have noticed i still gave it a five star rating and i will try to explain the reasons for doing so reading the reviews here i noticed two complaints one pointing out that this machine does n't perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine i researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while i spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money during my research it became very evident that my favorite rower is a water rower followed by schwinn 's windrigger both were extremely smooth in their operation both were also about 1000 ! at any rate these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the integrity and it should surprise nobody that the integrity does n't really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers and it should n't given it substantially lower price and this is exactly what it important in considering this rower you cannot expect to get a professional grade rower for such a low price just like you cannot expect to get the comfort and performance of a rolls royce if you are buying a honda nonetheless what you do get from integrity is well within the parameters of what i would expect for about 200 the machine is reasonably stable it is reasonably smooth and it does provide a great workout the noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the windrigger the electric monitor is basic and provides speed time calories burned and distance it also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout the seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and does n't appear flimsy i was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides it is much more than that of the schwinn windrigger in addition resistance can be adjusted pretty easily i think my only disappointment is that the air flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him her down but this is certainly a flaw i can live with as a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile which means you need to have a non slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface as i said before i also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower i cannot confirm this problem assembly was extremely easy and quick even though the instructions are not the greatest however it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze too all you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before i suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical but as i said the instructions are not great taking all these factors into account i think integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price it does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner however as with any product your expectations should be realistic and if they are you will not be disappointed if you expect a gym quality machine you will not get what you are looking for if however you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high end products then this is probably the best deal you can get	6
1	we got this toy for my son when he was 2 1 2 years old he is now 4 years old it still runs like new he drives it like a champ we have used it to haul mulch to the back yard and some yard bricks it never fails us and he think he is a big helper which he is i am thinking of buying a 2nd one for my younger son now	6

1	tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case which encompasses motherhood mental illness child abuse and matricide dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion that in and of itself is impressive because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other get caught up in emotion and appear unable to really present all sides of the story lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society 's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them but also tragically failed their mother	6

0	i have been using norton anti virus since i purchased the compaq presario 4000 the reason i have stuck with norton because this presario came with norton internet security 2002 attached to it i never used the nis 2002 though but i purchased the norton anti virus \( nav \) 2003 which i have bee using for the last three years in fact i used the nav 2004 for two straight years without any response from symantec then all of a sudden that subscription was eventually retired by symantec i liked the nav 2005 \( which symantec six months prior to its due date subscription which made me mad and hence my wanting to try nis at a subsidized rate \) because like nav 2003 it could tell if someone or something was trying to intrude into your computer it is after purchasing and trying nis 2005 that i realized how low and base norton can go with its software first when i tried nis 2005 it blocked all my websites i couldnt access them and i could not read my e mail \( whenever i tried to read my e mail the response would be that that action has been cancelled \) so i reformatted my hard drive and the nis 2005 appeared to be working quite well until i tred to install adobe reader 7 08 and could n't allow me to proceed moreover it was snail slow in allowing me to read one mail to another so i uninstalled nis 2005 and installed nav 2006 which appears to be working well i have now purchased tend micro pc cillin 2006 as well as mcafee viruscan 2006 at subsidized rates should symantec pematurely terminate my nav 2006 prematurely i e before the 366 days of subscription are over i think one of the reasons why nis could not work is that it is a program that it is trying to do more than it can chew it tried to be an anti virus personal firewall privacy control antispam as well as parental control in one it reminds of the days when it was better to purchase a cassette player separate from the radio since the technology at that time could not produce a good combined raio cassette player i think norton internet security is in that mode it is not yet competent to produce a combined solution that is both antivirus and anti spam anti spyware at the same time hence the many complaints of its being a buggy program at this stage i would stay away from any program that calls itself internet security i may try trend micro internet security which has received rave reviews from a couple of its users but that will be if something goes wrong with my current nav 2006 otherwise i am still wary of those programs that pass off as internet security such as norton internet security or trend micro internet security pending their perfection of this technology at some future date	6

1	ignore anyone who talks about this game 's shortcomings it 's a fun game addictive game period although one reviewer suggests that some of the levels are too easy i say that this only goes to keep the game \( and the plot \) moving in fact let 's face it when you break the tasks down events in a typical episode of 24 are n't that complex you run you hide you shoot things you drive fast and chase people but you do it all looking sounding and panting \( yes the video jack bauer even breathes like him \) almost as if you were in the show the kiss adage is fabulously apt keeping it simple is how the game makers have kept it fun related to this is the comment about trying to make the actual game play last 24 hours firstly the show itself is a little loosy goosey about real hour what with commercial breaks and its creative liberties secondly each hour is broken up into smaller missions and learning what it takes to do well in each section can take little time thirdly those that choose to complete their missions with finesse \( and higher scores \) will find that they 're not only coming closer the hour they 're also having more fun because they 're acting more like the characters in the show after all i suppose that someone who wants to complete their missions quickly could just avoid shooting anyone and instead just run past the enemies ! or better yet if that reviewer really wants to take the 24 hour thing seriously i'm surprised that he is n't complaining about being able to save progress to a memory card he really ought to be asking for a game that 's played straight out for an entire 24 hours no saving get it right the first time just like on the show	6

1	this is the fastest and funnest racing game we 've ever played it may not have simulated vehicles by specific manufacturers as in gran turismo but that does n't matter here because the fun comes in the super fast racing and battling as the name takedown implies a lot of this game is about taking your opponents out forcing them off the road into other cars etc the crashes in the game are well simulated so much so that there 's a crash mode where all you do is see how much damage your car can cause by crashing into other vehicles very fun game with high replay value ! p s if you are into cheat codes there do n't seem to be any for this game you have to win the different challenges to unlock vehicles events and locations	6

1	the is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals families and society the film is graphic in its depiction of addiction but as an addiction counselor who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery it is very close to actual tragic events i have seen in the world of addiction the emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent these events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many unfortunately even though some of the content may be offensive to some it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction 's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life watch and learn the truth about severe addiction	6

1	if you are like me and get the occasional zit when you least expect it then this works out well it will not remove the zit but it will cover the nasty monster pretty well ! ! i put it under my lancome powder and it really made a difference because it is clear it will blend in with whatever foundation or powder you use oh yes and it covers all the redness that comes with those nasty zits a girls new best friend	6
1	i received my 28 200 yesterday from amazon having read the customer reviews i immediately put my rebel xt on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28 200 and my canon 28 135 is three shots each at f stops 5 6 11 and 20 one set indoors at iso 1600 and the other outdoors at iso 200 focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera highest jpeg setting after shooting both series i compared them fresh out of the camera side by side results the 28 200 was at least as sharp as the 28 135 in both foreground and background in most instances it was visibly sharper at iso 200 with f stops 5 6 and 20 \( the 28 135 took the honors at f stop 10 \) and at 20 it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background the 28 135 was one stop faster shutterwise both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in photoshop there are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider different test scenes conceivably produce different results my conservative conclusion the 28 200 is as good as it gets for a super zoom on your canon \( unless you are going to drop 2200 on the l series 28 300 is and carry it \) and the 28 135 is has no clear sharpness advantage between these lenses its a tradeoff an extra 65 mm of focal length \( 105 mm after a 1 6 conversion \) versus image stabilization and low light shooting capability both lenses focus quickly and silently and both lenses produce usable shots	6
0	i have seen others wear these slides and i know adidas usually supplies an excellent product i did read the other reviews that warned of a need for breaking in the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process however i 've worn these slides for 2 months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless i continue to wear socks i am disappointed in the slide but i will stubbornly continue to wear them maybe some day they will be broken	6
0	i bought this for 30 from best buy what a waste of money ! the ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it the sound quality is terrible ! people i am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my motorola v300 what is worse people i am talking to hear me very poorly they say there is so much background noise it sounds like i am in a noisy bar even when i'm just sitting in my car people can barely hear me over the background noise racket	6

1	i really liked this movie i thought it was a great super hero movie that had some humor built into it it was well told and the characters were well developed the special effects were great too ! ! i am not one for comic book heros but this one confinced me otherwise i recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a good over evil story that was orginally a comic book character	6
0	i have been very disappointed in this product if i could return them i would i purchased this product because a friend of mine has some polycarbonate wine glasses which she has had for several years and that still look like new she even washes them in the dishwasher i have only had these for about 6 weeks and have only used them about 4 5 times each time i have hand washed them but they are very cloudy and i am embarrassed to use them i would not recommend them	6

0	this appealed to me since i would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways i liked to idea but just does n't work this mobile constantly stops working \( before the 8 minutes are up \) it stops going round the music continues the lights are still on but the base stops rotating it seems as though it always gets stuck and we have to push it to get unstuck we 've changed the battery and that does n't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck i contacted mattel to get a voucher since it 's been more than 90 days since i bought this ca n't return it in the store \( it 's kind of big and ugly too did n't expect that from the picture	6
1	i have not gotten into watching the dvd as of yet because i am still watching the reruns on tv but i know i have no qualms with the dvd i have bought all the series thus far it is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan	6
1	still embarking on spooling off all the hi 8 tapes i have but i 've been very satisfied with the plextor unit so far first thing i did was to spool one hi 8 tape and then make a dvd using the functionality of the bundled windvd creator software good news it worked and a few hours after i started i was watching the dvd i created on my bedroom dvd player bad news the software is full of minor and sometimes more than minor annoyances it may be that i'm still climbing the learning curve with it but i think it 's just not very good i'm looking into other solutions such as pinnacle adobe premiere elements etc meanwhile i keep spooling i have n't yet tried the tv capture in any depth it looked like it worked but again with some annoyances on the software side plextor could improve this offering vastly with the addition of some better bundled software	6
1	i take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week so when i travel on business taking a mat along is n't the best plan so i purchased these and when i traveled they were great on the hotel carpet i read some of the other reviews that they are n't durable and i do n't think these were designed for everyday use regardless i love them for travel or when i ca n't make it to the yoga studio	6
1	i picked up a copy of spirituality health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away this magazine is wonderful if you 're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life this magazine covers everything mind body and spirit the total package in the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in i highly recommend this magazine as i always catch myself saying to someone i just read this awesome article in spirituality health	6
0	my daughter loves it you wants to practice more often now thank	6
1	true they are a bit bitter but not too bitter and not nearly as bitter as unsweetened baker 's chocolate ! there are also some taste components i noticed that i 've never noticed with processed chocolate a delicate floral essence and flavor that adds character i was also surprised to find that raw cacao smells and looks like cooked chocolate i thought the smell and brown colour came mostly from the cooking process i want to try grinding them up and sweetening with agave nectar a delicious sweetener with a low glycemic index i tried sweetening a ground up mix with stevia i think i might 've used too much and i don't recommend this ! stevia is a good sweetener for a lot of foods but using too much leaves a bitter aftertaste i 'd recommend this product to anybody who likes chocolate especially raw foodists and chocolate connoisseurs enjoy	6
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	6
0	i purchased two cushions to use on small chairs when the cushions i arrived i could hardly believe how small they were smaller than the description stated in addition to the small size the cushions had a lot of stuffing and seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions	6
0	the new look is very nice but when you install you have also to keep the previous version \( in well behaved software automatically the previous version is cleaned not here \) the system of validation of license through internet for the physical machine is fine i just hope that i will not have a disk crash and then waste time to be authorised to re install a product that i rightfully paid \( and at such a price \) well make sure you do not try to de install 5 5 after the install of cs2 \( or bye bye the license \) have a clean and robust backup of your installation i am not sure i will make the next upgrade	6
1	i ordered both the brown sugar jerky and the peppered and both were absolutely fanstastic this jerky has a slightly tender consistency which makes it easy to chew the flavor is sublime not too salty just the right amount of sweetness a real taste treat i am on my second 2lb order i am totally hooked	6
0	giving 2 stars on the suction alone hepa filter does n't self clean turn after one use a lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you do n't pay very close attention to aligning it just right i really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it 's heavy and dirt just falls out a lot of dirt when emptying the dirt box i'm returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience	6
0	i heard that song recently quot three strange days quot and i recalled how much i detested it when it came out overt pandering to tyros in altered states now i ca n't get it out of my head and may require a lobotomy there was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91 but this was n't part of that canon nice try school of fish have fun playing the cyo circuit	6
0	this book should get 0 stars speaking as an artist myself the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous the basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics etc to me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse admittedly i could not even finish this book after reading for the nth time a line of shaky circumstantial evidence like all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw but there are no correction marks therefore optics must have been used i could not even stand to keep reading ! on the contrary all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction that is just one example the book is filled with flaky examples such as those hockney claiming this is too good to have been done without optics or this was too difficult to have been done without optics and i found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art if that is indeed what he thinks and modern artists must remember this nowadays the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists for many reasons superior art education is very hard to find and there are many distractions in the modern world \( tv computers having to hold a 'day job' lack of patrons etc \) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did therefore most will never attain the skill of the old masters but that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology ! some of the other examples used as 'evidence' refer to 'odd' proportion perspective etc in otherwise masterful work i am surprised that this author \( and those readers who are artists \) apparently does not realize that throughout history great artists did not necessarily strive for exact realism even nowadays photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists because after all we are artists not cameras ! the point of realist art is to accentuate the reality not to copy it ! therefore many inconsistencies in proportion perspective etc evident in old masters' work are not 'oddities' or 'mistakes' but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition all that being said i think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of 'trickery' or technology of some sort instead an art student should be encouraged to build skill discipline and self reliance because that is the true secret of the great masters	6
1	while the dubbing may be a little annoying i still love this movie the fight scenes are great and the movie is pretty funny at times driving motorcycles over cars will always be cool in my book do n't expect the deepest movie in the world but do expect a quality martial arts film	6
0	i had the tx sr304 everything sounded great however certain times when i played my dvd the onyko produced a loud high pitched ear piercing sound sounds almost like a record scratching the most common times it made this sound was during the dvd menu when it replays the music theme the receiver would transition from dolby digital to stereo then back to dd again then making that loud sound everything was great but this one problem made me return this item which is a bummer because i would have kept it otherwise	6
0	we have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us we were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us so now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor if you live out in the middle of no where or you do n't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you	6
1	this product works great for bodywash but is much too thick to be a shampoo	6
1	this really is a cool pedal free bike we got it for our three and a half year old and he really likes it friends of ours \( with more disposable income \) bought their daughter a like a bike which is about twice the price i have yet to discover any big difference in performance the like a bike is certainly nice looking if a bit precious since it is constructed primarily out of wood the kettler looks fine however more like a real bike in fact and less like a museum piece the only reasons i would n't give the kettler five stars are 1 you need to assemble it and the instructions are not great \( my husband who is generally a handy guy managed to get it together but not without some swearing \) 2 the wheel covers make it hard to inflate the tires	6
1	the pump works well certainly as good as can be expected for the excellent price ! it does however leave at least an inch of oil in the bottom of the pot the instructions say that this last bit of oil is too dirty and it is best discarded in reality the design of the pump just does n't allow it to suck oil up from that low a level i was however able to sufficiently filter most of these last few cups of oil using the pump and a large mouth jar when poured into a jar with a much smaller diameter the oil is deep enough that the pump can get to it leaving only a small amount that i did n't mind discarding	6
0	in terms of both format and style and despite its superficially modernist tendencies rent has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition yet it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters in more traditional musicals the long stretches of spoken exposition between song and dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable flesh and blood human beings this is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like phantom of the opera which seems a natural for this type of approach but with material like rent which is small in scale and intimate in scope the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience i know that this play \( and perhaps now even the movie \) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers rent practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism but to someone like myself coming cold to the work rent adds up to much less than the sum of its parts the story a modern day update of la boheme set in greenwich village starts on christmas eve 1989 and ends on christmas eve 1990 this was at the height of the aids epidemic and indeed many of the film 's characters primarily gay men and former junkies are struggling with the disease \( aids being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story \) there 's also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists \( one is tempted to call them deadbeats \) from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re developing a city block rent with its noble performance artists doing battle against the big bad corporate bullies feels less like a relic from the `80 's than one from the `60 's though intended to be the heroes of the piece the artists and bohemians often come across as na ve painfully self absorbed and annoyingly self righteous an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local atm machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend 's name \( the heavily allegorical angel \) as the password \( this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man \) anything`s better than actually working i suppose and becoming a tool of corporate america when one of the men finally takes a dreaded job \( a mere sinecure i might add \) so that he can actually pay the rent he owes \( horrors ! \) he acts as if he is selling his soul to satan and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest to god paycheck i wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them with the exception of newcomer rosario dawson the filmmakers have retained most of the original broadway cast members for the movie and even though their acting is n't all that impressive some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing in his direction chris columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we 're watching despite the constantly tracking sometimes even spinning camera he has chosen to employ the film still feels stagy over stylized and artificial in almost every scene as to the libretto by the late jonathon larsen only one tune strikes me as truly memorable while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling one of the problems too with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian pedestrian and prosaic when they are n't pseudo intellectual drivel on the order of the opposite of war is n't peace it 's creation that they become unintentionally funny when set to music it 's not for nothing that the sharks and the jets did n't actually sing out most of their confrontations there are admittedly some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings i have ever seen in a motion picture in that one crucial moment the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it i don`t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for rent \( or of its many devoted followers \) but it`s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people especially sensitive artists should be allowed to live on other people`s properties for free	6
0	i got this because it was cheap at k mart and thank goodness i can return it the ball is really small i love how they omit the size from all of their information i did n't pump it up with the pump so i do n't know how good that is \( i used an air compressor \) the other equipment is n't too bad but i was really getting this for the ball which just so happens to be a piece of poopola i would n't suggest getting this	6
1	this is simply one of the best movie magazines on the market you can always be sure to be updated on the latest movies and dvd releases and it 's nice that the crew of empire does n't take themselves too seriously the articles are well written but keeps the humour intact as well where other movie magazines seem to be too keen on showing how intellectual they are unfortunately it 's rather expensive here in denmark but it 's worth the price	6
0	i bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen that was a bad decision after having received two issues i continue to be disappointed the quality of the art design and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky i would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine	6
1	i found the product to be very useful myself wiring diagrams are better than any books i had seen and now i know why the information here comes from mitchell1 most of the pro technicians i know pay good money every month to use it the vehicle has a leak near the tailgate area and there were some honda tech bulletins here that i never knew about it was worth it just for that and details of the surprise third fuse panel under the hood true some of it might be over your head but overall i found eautorepair to be a great deal for a car savvy do it yourselfer	6
1	final fantasy vii dirge of cerberus is said to be the last spin off \( aside psp 's crisis core \) and the one that goes furthest into the future of the vii world the game seems like a must play for final fantasy vii and vincent valentine fans alike and it is thinking most of those fans probably play mostly rpgs this game is relatively easier than popular fps \( shooters \) like halo being an rpg fan yet still wanting to learn the story of the game i was very happy for the easy difficulty \( though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode \) the controls are a little bad but nothing that someone ca n't get used to for one of square 's second or third shooter games this one is pretty good i 'd recommend if you 're doing what i did and playing it for story then get the official guide so you can get all of the hidden capsules as you go \( which unlocks the cutscenes and once you retrieve them you never have to get them again \) the guide is actually pretty good for this game as well as the soundtrack if you 're a fan of the final fantasy music definitely pick the soundtrack up lastly if you 're a final fantasy fan or rpg fan get this game and everything related to it it 's worth it i could n't put this game down even if some characters are a bit under developed if you 're a shooter fan for games like halo you will probably be disappointed	6
1	i would n't say they 're my favorite pair but i definitely like them soft comfortable sexy	6

0	if you 're in the bathroom with time on your hands ! i must admit that i did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over puzo \( like leon uris \) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception in just a few hundred pages president kennedy ii is shown as a tyrant a socialist a reactionary a humanitarian a political bumbler a visionary of usa utopia a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector a dear and loving husband father etc how many characters must one man be \? and what 's this odd sub plot of a former mormon hollywood oddball who on a whim \( in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself \) decides to kill the president of the united states once again another character with fourteen different personalities ! puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the mormons \( he should have stuck with the catholic church \) i would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me ! i would go crazy reading it again	6
1	very impressed so far used it to recondition 2 batteries and charge up 2 others and it has worked flawlessly never impressed with black and decker tools but i think they got it right this time time will tell and i would have given it 5 stars if it holds up for a few years	6

0	i purchased this product in an attempt to help out with jet lag and it worked really well i 've used it a few times since and find it does n't send me to sleep any quicker than usual but i do n't tend to wake up through the night if i 've taken it it 's obviously not something you 'd want to rely on all the time but very its handy as a occasional aid if you 're having a bad run of nights does n't make you feel hung over the next day either sadly i ca n't buy any more because australia does n't recognise the product i do n't know why because as far as i can make out its active ingredient is good old fashioned benadryl	6

1	i had heard about this flick being talked about as the chinese charlie 's angels it took me a while but i finally popped it in wow this has to be on of the coolest movies i have seen in a while i was expecting a chick flick but maybe that is why i liked it so much the story is about these 2 women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do now is assasinate people for a living sweet ! i am not going to lie i was n't paying attention to the story what so ever the first time i saw this because of how hot these women are add in a super hot cop who wants to take them down and you have yourself one of the funnest movie ever all of these girls know martial arts or at least they can put their legs up really high and director corey yuen puts in some of the best wirework i have seen this movie certainly is n't going to win any awards for it 's high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that i wish i could fill my room with about 100 diffrerent screen shot posters so on top of this being an amazingly fun movie yasuaki kurata shows up for the finale ! ! ! ! ! ! ! corey yuen goes all out with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie if you have seen some of coery 's 80 's stuff like yes madam or even the newer fong sai yuk then get ready to be taken back some years when corey did some of the best action sequences in the history of cinema \( example ninja in the dragon 's den \) kurata plays a great character in my favorite movie ever legend of a fighter which was made in 1981 well at 56 years old he looks just as good ! ! ! ! i was so amazed by this movie i have watched it 3 nights in a row and i will continue this routine for a while \) the picture quality on the columbia tristar version is perfect and has pretty well written subtitles also good 5 1 sound cantonese track the original mandarin track and a horrible english dub	6

0	i have had this camera since jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10 000 shots while on trips and at weddings do n't expect much from it and you will be happy as an entry level dslr it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions i find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light provided that they are not moving cons in landscape photography this camera is lacking both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well battery dies fast the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting especially when shooting in raw mode i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode \( approx 150 shots \) before the battery dies surprisingly when shooting jpegs i get more shots per charge \( over 300 \) but hardly enough to last a day i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike so i always carry a backup film camera \( my trusty elan 7 \) the viewfinder is very dim when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d 's viewfinder in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap especially when having to resort to manual focus autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible when shooting indoors the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus the 420ex flash is supposed to talk to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed however with the 300d this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over under exposed after about five months the shutter button started sticking i would click it and then it would remain depressed the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button and since there is only one thumbwheel it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed for example if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera this is a real annoyance so would i recommend this camera if you are a casual point and shoot person it 's an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately look elsewhere	6

1	i was very excited to get my hands on this book i have been ordering this series from amazon co as they are released as i can get them several months ahead on their american counter parts i must say that i was disappointed with the beginning of the book first hem is not the character that i wanted to read about second the start is slow and the plot drags a little but all is forgiven after 100 pages i warmed up to hem i actually think that the authors writting style has improved each book and this book just feels right i was done reading way before i wanted to be done the ending is nothing but action i put the book down entertained and wanting more what else can you ask for in a work of fictio	6

1	i just bought these and my daughter looks adorable the first time i put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them the shades come with two straps one small and one large my daughter is four months old and the smaller strap barely fits but the larger one is still a little big the velcro on either side of the smaller strap is just barely attached and fits comfortably only if around the bottom of her head in this position her ears are a little pushed down but as the strap is soft it 's not a big deal if straight around her head the shades are too tight and squish the area around her eyes even if adjusted as small as possible the large strap is still a little too big it should fit in another month i think	6
1	it 's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there but thank halstead co for proving me wrong i am happily pleased with their latest and very eagerly awaited effort instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on say out of tune they give us 41 minutes of what seems like basically it 's good everything 's going just way ok it 's happy maybe i 'll hear a lyric later that says something else but for those for whom music is the priority you ca n't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop four and a half stars	6
0	seriously the sound is the worst i have encountered on any dvd release a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles there is a lot of video jittery things going on it all adds up to my conclusion that the dvd version is transfered from a very very bad analog copy on top of all the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled dont buy this unless you are a fanatic wkw fan who already own all other releases	6
1	i love it i am a 55 year old woman in pretty good shape and i was able to get it out of the box and assembled completely by myself it arrived very very quickly my only complaint is that the bottle of touch up for the aluminum finish which came with it was not securely closed and leaked out so that when i opened the box i could smell the strong odor of solvent everywhere and the bottle was empty	6
1	i received the 10 pc set from my husband for christmas i have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them the pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly i feel we made a good choice	6
0	pull ups are not very good for potty training they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom potty training does not include using diapers that is what these are is fancy diapers if you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them the wetness liner is a joke these also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants	6

1	bought these to use while doing my daily walks mowing they work 100 better than the little lipstick antenna you get with the myfi plus you do n't have to use the earphones the only time i lose signal is if i'm really boxed in an area that does n't face south it actually works in some areas inside my house the sound quality is good enough for a casual audiophile like me besides there ai n't much in the way of other options this is my second pair because my first pair had the left channel crap out because of a broken wire after a year so i use them as an extra antenna in the kitchen when i want to use the fm tuner on the radio	6
0	the product description should state that it does not work with the verizon v3c ! when plugged in it states unauthorized charger and will not charge at all \( although if the battery is dead it will give you enough juice to speak but it still wo n't charge \( \? \) \)	6
0	i was very disappointed in this mirror i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because i do use the mirror i have a 2000 vw passat with a headrest in the middle seat so i had no problem installing it it 's great to watch my little one while i drive i do see the other reviewer 's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road however it never obstructed my view at all i registered for this because of the remote control feature well the remote control only turns the unit on and off and you have to keep the switch on the unit on \( remote control access mode \) in order for it to work there 's a switch on the unit to play music or turn the lights on and play music you cannot control that feature from the remote control you also cannot control the volume from the remote it 's really a pain i'm keeping it because i like the mirror but i'm not happy with it save your money and buy the safefit baby in sight mirror	6

0	there is at times a fine line between noise and music nin not only crossed that line in this cd but stomped on it a few times in the process not even close to the calibre of with teeth this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians songs that go from semi music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide while playing the same thing over and over and well you get my drift if great music is your thing pass this one up or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination	6
1	this is the best of the leappad books i have seen my four year old has spent hours on it it 's very interactive and covers a lot of ground for that age highly recommended	6

0	the prime rib slices i had were pre cooked and they are terrible nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home they lack in both flavor and texture the remaining slices i have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos	6

1	our 10 piece of junk umbrella stroller \( you know the one \) bit the dust on a 10 day trip to europe so in a bit of emergency we got this one at harrod 's in london and about had a cow paying 60 pounds for this exact stroller turns out it 's the best one we could have gotten and the price was right you ca n't go wrong it 's sturdy well balanced super easy to fold up and carry around \( sling it over your shoulder it 's that light \) and has a nice larger sun rain shield \( ours happened to come with a rain cover as well but this was in london and i do n't know if this us version comes with it automatically \) the color orange is great for boys or girls and bright enough for pedestrian traffic awareness love it like many people with two kids we calculated that we 've gone through half a dozen strollers over the past 8 years \( how does that happen \? ! car seats too \) and this is the best so far go for it	6
0	i would recommend a seat that clamps to the side of the tub over this if your baby moves at all ! this seemed like a good idea but my little guy was kicking and moving all over it barely floats and sucks up water so it is extremely heavy to lift up and hang to dry when you are done with the bath it also says that it is for 0 months on up but i definitely would n't use this if your baby ca n't sit	6

1	i and my wife have been very pleased with the jeep wrangler all weather umbrella stroller unlike the cheap umbrella stroller we used to have this one has better construction for the main folding support tubes plus the handles are longer which means i \( 5' 1'' guy \) do n't have to walk like a neanderthal to push my toddler the wheels do work pretty well on most surfaces even in very light snow the brakes are durable plastic and should last longer than my previous stroller the pouches are an added plus for storing snacks or bus passes my only disappointment has been the sun screen it is not that useful for blocking the sun from my son 's eyes unless i pull it directly in front of him at that point he ca n't see anything that 's ok if he falls asleep but otherwise he \( an independent todler \) will pull the sunscreen off if it blocks his view an added bonus would be a shoulder strap that i could use to carry the stroller for walking more than a few feet while it 's light and compact for a stroller it is still cumbersome to carry if you have to fold it on the bus or walk anywhere with it frequently my son wants to walk so i take the stroller with me because i know he 'll get tired so again a shoulder strap would make toting the stroller much easier	6
1	let me count the ways they 're great for a quick energizing snack breakfast healthy dessert and tonight i even had one for dinner they are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they 're good for you ! plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball they 're very filling and only about 200 calories genius	6
1	\( review written by my wife the user \) i 've happily used the quicken checkbook program for many years when we changed operating systems from windows xp to windows vista i was unable to get the quicken 2002 version to work in vista so i purchased quicken basic 2007 and am totally pleased with the program the only feature i use is the checkbook program and as far as i'm concerned it 's perfect i 've never used the download from bank option because i prefer to review all posted transactions when the bank statement arrives i use edit preferences feature to tailor the program to my liking and i could n't be happier the price is reasonable too	6
0	this item is very heavy and bulky descriptions give you the idea that your feet will endure the kneading action as well as your calves however that is not the case your feet only rest on these two painful round balls that only vibrate should you wish them too the kneading pressure can not be regulated only the speed the kneading pressure is very intense and can be very uncomfortable at times if my massage therapist ever worked like this i would fire immediately i tired to like it however quickly returned after a few days	6
1	i recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended asics shoes to me this is my first pair of running shoes and i am very pleased with it the shoes were very comfortable from the day one one comment that i have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front i have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe i worked out fine for me however because i had purchased 1 2 size longer than what i usually wear overall i am very happy with this pair and would recommend it	6
1	great price free shipping basically i love it ! ! i placed my order on sunday and got it 8 00 a m tuesday morning i highly recommend this seller i will definitely continue to buy from this seller myself	6

1	yes this film feels like a diatribe it 's probably less factual than the film version of john dillinger 's exploits that director john milius made in the seventies so why do i recommend this film over milius' more polished account \? well this film in a campy over the top way is just so entertaining secondly lawrence tierney in the title role is such a magnetic screen presence his tough ferocity keeps the film 's campier elements in check and grounds it in some semblance of reality there 's also a good supporting cast here with gangster veterans marc lawrence and elisha cook jr \( seems like he 's in all these noir gangster flicks \) on hand the story is told here crisply and in an economical 70 minutes so if you have an hour plus to kill there 's worse ways to do it oh john if only you had the two bucks to pay for the drinks !	6

0	i used to have ddr for xbox and when my xbox broke on me i decided not to spend the money on a new one however i missed my ddr workouts everyday so i bought this as a replacement i should have spent the money on a new xbox this product is not worthy of having the name ddr on the box imagine a dance pad game for atari then imagine it is the worst possible atari game you have ever seen and that would be a close description of this game there are 50 computer generated beeping monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you the rythem and the timing is off on all the songs and the dance pad is very poor quality it was n't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home i wish i had sent it back without opening it now i'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take	6
0	i am very disappointed with this product using the features of it are very difficult \( red eye sizing etc \) in addition digital photos downloaded into photo album 6 are of poor quality clarity on the computer screen i expected more from it but have found i have less i will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features	6
1	overall this is a great little knife it opens fast is very sharp and holds it 's edge well and feels good in your hand the liner lock is great i have used some others and absolutely hated them because they were so hard to operate this one is smooth as silk and located in a great position very nicely designed i did make a few changes which required going out and buying a torx screwdriver first i reversed the pocket clip because it came the facing the opposite direction i was used to on my spyderco knives second the safety had to go i found it slipped to the on position on its own so the knife did not open when you expected it to and was hard to disengage quickly not because it was difficult to operate rather it is tiny and hard to find blind if you like the safety though it definitely does prevent the blade from opening accidentally speaking of safety the knife arrives razor sharp i opened my package and promptly sliced a finger badly enough to leave a scar the tension that the blade is under requires some force to overcome and gives it a different feel when closing the knife from a regular lockback be sure you fingers are nowhere near the blade i am now in the habit of disengaging the lock and closing by pressing the back of the blade against my thigh	6
1	this is the best product we have ever used for our little girl \( yes that includes swings and bouncy seats \) i stumbled across it when they had just come out she was sitting in it at 4 months by the time she started crawiling though we couldnt use it because she was able to twist herslef and climb out of it however i see now that they have an attachment for it so it can be used for self feeding i recommend this to everyone we know who is starting their family or already have had a child it allows the caregiver to be hands free and it helps your little one learn to be more independant faster \( which is a double edged sward ! tough fro parents good for kids \)	6
0	wow what a fine example of terrible engineering the only control is a knob that ranges from off to super to set the thermostat you turn the knob to the super setting when the room reaches a comfortable level you slowly turn the thermostat down until the heater goes off this is the point at which the thermostat setting equals the room temp at this setting the thermostat will automatically turn on and off to maintain the selected temp this design sets the stage for a frustrating user experience by design you must turn the thermostat to the highest setting then wait for the room to heat up before fiddling with the knob until the unit clicks off at which point you end up turning it up a bit until it clicks on \( if it does \) its like trying to adjust your home 's thermostat in the dark just show me where to set the dial for 68 degrees and let me get on with my day when the heater is working as designed it turns on for 30 60 seconds turns off for 10 90 seconds then repeats the cycle relentlessly and unpredictably until you unplug it let it cool box it back up and send it back i want a refund reimbursement for lost productivity and an ice cream sandwich	6
0	i was so happy to order this it has n't even been put together yet in box for two weeks they sent the wrong hardware with it i emailed them 2 times and got no response after twenty minutes of trying i finally got a human voice she was nice and shipped the parts they arrived today and guess what \? the same wrong parts again i ca n't get a response so i guess i will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together at least i have a list from the owner 's manual overall experience was a big fat bust	6
1	ok let me start by saying i am not a coffee snob i am more of a coffee nut i very much prefer a cup of my nice dark italian roast but if the neighbor offers me a cup of his foldgers i wont turn up my nose and for a guy like me this machine is perfect ! ! i looked at the 500 dollar machines but just couldnt see spending that for something i see myself using 4 5 days out of the week so i setteled on this machine and i have not one regret i have had the machine about 3 weeks now i admit i dont use it every day as i have thoses mornings where i am just running late and dont have time but in that three weeks i have used it at least 5 days out of every week and it has been great this thing is so easy to use right out of the box with the pods i was just amased my old machine went down quite a while ago so i havent pulled a shot in a very long time and with this machine i was sipping a great one in minutes ! the one thing that did dissapoint me is the pods i bought the machine thinking i would use them as they seemed so convient and dont get me wrong the illy dark roast pods make one of the best shots of espresso i have ever had very quickly but keep in mind they only make one shot at a time so for me who usually likes 3 or 4 shots in a cappucino they are a bit time consuming and i have found it better to just pack my own double shots but besides that little thing this machine is perfect for a coffee nut like me it does a great job no matter what im in the mood for be it a straight shot a cappucino or the nice mocha latte every now and then this is a great machine for you may not be good enough for a coffee snob but just right for a coffee nut ! oh and one hint i found very helpfull turn the machine on 5 or 10 minutes before you are going to use it \( the longer the better \) with your cups up on the warmer i saw some people complaining that the espresso was only luke warm when it came out i exprenced the same problem when i dont let it warm up and brew into a cold cup but if you do let it warm up it will make you a nice piping hot espresso !	6
1	i was a little skeptical about the gazelle at first because it did n't look like you could get a work out from using it but i was wrong ! but let 's start at the beginning it 's pretty easy to set up the directions on the dvd were great and i could do it all myself i was really excited to use it so i hopped right on \( i'm already used to ellipticals \) and enjoyed a great workout i was sweating and after watching the training dvd i worked my upper body and lower body i look forward to using it tomorrow now i do n't have to drag myself to the gym i can work out at home ! downsides it does squeak but some wd40 or petroleum jelly should fix that it folds up but it 's not extremely portable i have it in my living room currently all in all i recommend this product i can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training you 'll see results	6
0	ernest hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300 page book and so does author valerie hemingway 's story for that reason this book merits only two stars early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in 1959 at age 19 valerie is aware of the author 's magnetic and dominant personality around him everything came to life there was an urgency and vitality that did not ebb when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway this is an endearing look at the older struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of a moveable feast but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject as a result her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a e hotchner 's papa hemingway the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain paris key west cuba and america share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway 's strange son gregory \( apparently the other bull referred to in the title \) it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway even in death and over 40 years later that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man	6

0	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	6
0	this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy does n't respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just do n't play the pc version borrow someone 's xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	6
1	my car was broken into several months ago so i decided to buy the wrap it has worked so well it is better than other steering wheel binders since it has an alarm on it much cheaper than other conventional car alarms a little bulky but it does the job i really think thieves think twice when they see the huge thig on the steering wheel and the lights for the alarm i am really glad i got this product here at amazon co	6

1	i have been a fan since valotte and i like the other reviewers here ca n't believe why this cd did n't receive the airplay it deserves ! there must have been some politics in there with sean 's cd coming out on the same day \( yoko \? \) it is one of those cds that you just leave on and you do n't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you do n't like ! i love every song ! ! especially day after day i should have known i do n't want to know and my fav right now cold i hope that what i have heard is true that he is working on his latest now ca n't wait ! buy this cd you wo n't regret it	6

1	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	6
1	this is great granola and at such a great price ! i usually make my own but for this price it 's not worth the effort ! thanks for the great value	6
1	most of the other reviews printed here i am in agreement with there is little i need to add except that i saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape i just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some schlesinger 's work the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek happiness in all of the wrong places especially in the wrong people after the twenty odd years of first viewing this film i realized tonight how strong julie christie 's performance is in this film there is not one hole in this bravura performance it 's odd to make this statement especially since she 's playing such a shallow role it 's not an easy nor a desirable part to play but she carries it off as if she herself were the character selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity and she stoops and conquers laurence harvey has never played the rogue better and dirk bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart but nevertheless gives in \( but not completely \) to ms christie 's empty needs he indeed sees through her throughout most of the film but cannot help being swayed by her charms emptiness served up brilliantly and we must respect the talents involved for providing us with a lesson as well as thank them \( on two levels at least talent coupled with making us examine what should really be of value to us \)	6
1	hi folks the movies all look very good and there are a nice group of bonus features from vintage featurettes to commentaries ! on macao i particularly enjoyed the 30 minute interview with jane russell and robert mitchum that robert osborne conducted very late in the life of mr mitchum the packaging it great and frankly 6 films from the great robert mitchum at under 10 each on dvd w bonus features is a terrrrrifffic deal ! the movies are n't generally considered mitchum 's best or best known but when you consider you 've got jean simmons as a costar and otto preminger directing angel face josef von sternberg helming macao vincent minnelli directing home from the hill the great fred zinneman directing and the legend deborah kerr co starring in the sundowners you can figure this is n't the bottom of the barrel either ! oh and sydney pollack directed the yakuza and contributes a great commentary to sum up warner bros continues to deliver the very best classic titles on dvd with the best combination of quality transfers bonus features and value packages ! ! ! !	6
0	not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand	6
1	compared to fp 2000 and earlier versions it offered some major improvements even letting one code in \( gasp \) php with live preview it is highly configurable and easily tied into sharepoint \( well i think that was the intent \) it was quite an evolution moving beyond fp2000 with some fairly advanced features while still retaining the entry level small business learnable functionality \( albeit cookie cutter designs \) of previous versions i was surprised to find it even offered options to strip out all code that hinted this site was made with frontpage \( an odd change knowing ms \) but also offered other code functions some on par with dreamweaver but do not mistake this for dreamweaver even the first mx version it 's still aimed at microsoft only you really have to dig and tweak to configure it for anything else \( e g php cold fusion \) but it does offer some major improvements for flexibility over previous versions mostly good some horribly bad the good being able to tweak it to dozens of standards' compliance sec 508 xml'ish stuff whatever by default these things are not set up so it does take some learning what annoyed \( and freaked me out \) was that while it easily allowed for desktop development with access to create database driven sites the database had to remain in a public folder ok i suppose if you 're using it only on an intranet i believe the point was to code with access then mod it slightly to interact with sql server but most folks probaby did not use it that way knowing the history and fire and forget ease of use of frontpage anyhow i 'd call this a para professional version it has way more flexibility and functionality than any version of frontpage ever it is also going bye bye there will not be a frontpage 2007 due to the switch to expression web \( which retains some fp functionality but the friendly and pesky bots are gone \) no more email bots whatever bots gotta learn how to roll your own	6
1	my cousin 's wife is a professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses to me for clothing lifestyle photoshoots \( i 've been pretty active in this area for some time just now starting to go full digital \) and i 've used the f 2 8l about four or five times and this is one of the best lenses i 've used period shooting wide open allows you to retain high shutter speeds for night shots as well as get very interesting and vibrant long shutter shots \( of crowds the freeway at night etc \) when shooting action shots the tripod mount can get in the way of zooming and focusing but it can be removed easily enough i personally just purchased the f 4 0l which coupled with a relatively wide max aperture and shooting at either 1600 or 3200 on my 20d should do nicely but i still rate the 2 8 high up on my list	6

1	while this certainly is n't the best pearl jam concert ever it is n't the worst either the first disc starts a little slow but you ca n't argue with getting to hear song 's like in my tree and faithfull highlights are love boat captain a nice opener one of the best of riot act song 's for sure in my tree one of if not my favorite pj songs not quite as rocking as the 2000 tour performances but still great gimme some truth maybe not a technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt and passionate good john lennon cover even flow always great spin the black circle the band starts to get more into the show after this rocking performance thumbing my way just a great slow song breath in my opinion the best performance of the show just great crown of thorns i really like this version of the song played well whether you think ed should sing it or not baba o'reilly the classic who song a great performance just try to sit still during this one i would reccomend this dvd to anyone that is a pearl jam fan already but if you 're not then i would start with some of their studio albums first	6

1	which i suppose i'm not allowed to say what with the worldwide phenomenon that was songs from the big chair but i think it 's right roland took the opportunity following the breakup with curt to make an aggressively postmodern record and return to the steely eyed austerity that the lyrics on the hurting always suggested indeed this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time as a previous reviewer noted goodnight song has what has since become a familiar aor sound i call it the first coldplay song and it 's fair to suggest that band would never exist without tears for fears roland also finally nails the pacing of an album here on songs and seeds 8 tracks was not enough to allow for a full dynamic arc a sense of opening progression and completion the 10 songs here have room to breathe vary significantly between each other and finally close satisfyingly with goodnight as both roland and curt have matured they have also mellowed the anger they felt at the world and towards each other seems to be gone and their latest album everybody loves a happy ending has none of the dge that made their older stuff so energizing but cds do n't age so pick this sucker up it really does n't get much better	6
1	this dual watch winder is awesome not only is it ultra stylish but it works great although i have expensive tastes when it comes to watches i cannot justify paying more than 100 for a watch winder that no one will ever see this dual watch winder works great with my tag heuer link and my movado it 's truly a great buy no reason to spend more money	6
0	lucky magazine makes me feel not so lucky it makes me sad that i can not afford all the items they put in their magazine one month they tell me round toed shoes are in and show me 50 pictures of shoes that i would love to own of which 2 i can afford then the following month lucky tells me round toed shoes are out and square toed shoes are in and show me another 50 pictures you get the idea \? this magazine is based on trends and you will be broke if you try to keep up and feel bad if you ca n't afford all the great things it is showing i did enjoy lucky for it 's profiles on upcoming designers some great website links and the one or two affordable items it does toss in each section i also got a few ideas on how to wear clothing in new and different ways most of the time though i felt sad and envious after i finished reading it these are feelings i 'd rather not encounter i think i would enjoy it more if it were more informative discussing the quality differences in the items they are showing maybe testing them out in different situations to help me make the best choice in my purchases	6
1	works great fits well and has a nice design definitely recommend i	6
1	these little nibs are very bitter i would n't recomend poppin them straight from the bag they were fabulous melted in a pan with some sweetner dip with chunked fruit lay on tray covered with wax paper and refridgerate for 20 min the chocolate hardens raspberries are my families' favorite but any fruit works ! also very good sprinkled in warm milk for a homemade hot chocolate this is a great product for experimental food people straight out of the bag disappointing	6
0	this book up to the very end was very good with out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half the end is what ruins the entire thing do n't worry i'm not going to spoil anything i 'll just say the ending stinks out loud ! this story is not really horror its sifi a adventure drama sifi it really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed and somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough the writting was dead on as always and character development was good this book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book	6
1	high fives to paperport 11 pro ! being in a business where i am constantly told to print this and print that off of one website and another a product like paperport professional 11 has really come to my rescue the product has given the opportunity to do something with a document picture or file other than printingnow when i select the document or file and hit my print option button i now can print it to a multi page pdf if i choose to do so files that i download scan save or archive are no longer just random clutter on my hard drive i can retrieve the information from them effortlessly using the product 's powerful search engine i was thrilled to find that its all in one search engine was able to work with files generated in many ms office applications all i needed to do was remember some of the content text and the pp pro 11 would find the file for me now i'm stacking individual ms office files into logically named pdf groups or using the product to search the web and retrieve information of interest i find pp pro 11 to be well worth the money and my time to use it	6
1	i bought this game not as a video game but so i could have my own personal trainer without paying for a gym membership i am two weeks into my 12 week routine and i love it the software is very well done and it really does have real time feedback if i'm leaning forward when i'm not suppose to while doing an exercise the trainer will say try standing up straight i am definitely getting a great work out 10 more weeks and i 'll let you know if it did any good or not so far it seems to be helping i love that it builds on itself so that by week 12 you are doing more routines that are more intense the one drawback is the camera is really sensitive i have to make my kids leave the room because if they walk around in the background it picks up their movements and lowers my score if you hate the gym but have always wanted your own personal trainer kinetic seems to be the way to go	6
1	we received a graco travel system from our registry and got some good use out of it however we are in a big city and the stroller just could n't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads not to mention it was so rickety i'm positive we could be heard a mile away i broke down and ordered the jeep liberty limited urban terrain jogger and i love it 1 it was simple to assemble 2 it is easier on my hands and wrists to steer 3 the air filled tires provide a much smoother ride for my daughter 4 the toy steering wheel \? she freaks out over it in a good way she beeped her horn about 30 consecutive times in the grocery store since that distracted her from pulling boxes off the shelves i am ultra pleased 5 the price is wonderful we do n't use the music on the move feature so i ca n't really comment on it i fill the tires right before we leave the house every time and it 's not hard to do so i have no complaints there it is a bulky item so transporting it and carrying it is a bit tricky however the pros all outweigh the cons for me i am extremely pleased with it	6
1	the best edition so far however the color is smeared and skewed just enough to bother me but what do you want for 10 bucks \? i saw gorgo a bunch of times in first run and i remember seeing the actual gorgo creature on it 's trailer being driven up woodward ave in detroit on it 's way to the fox theater a great promo the eyes are the thing i remember most as gorgo rises from the sea those red glowing eyes were just beautiful and so expressive the color smearing just manages to obscure those eyes but still this print is the best i 've seen if i live long enough i hope they issue a perfect hd version of this movie i would pay 3 times the price of this edition to get my clutches on that but this is worth the cost a must for any serious collector	6
0	this accessory system does not fit my kohlcraft umbrella stroller i can find a place to put the parent cupholder but there is no place at all to put the child 's snack tray the stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller the whole purpose of spending the money on this system \( which was considerably more expensive than others in the store \) was for my child to have a snack tray therefore it 's going back to the store there are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this even the prince lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive the product itself is also very cheaply made the s hooks look so flimsy i would n't trust them again they sell thicker sturdier s hooks that look like they will work much better than this so that 's what i 'll purchase plus the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy already the arms have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter ! thirdly i'm not sure if it was the clips that came in my packet \( perhaps a defect \) or if they are all made this way but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips and then they did n't fasten correctly no matter how i tried \( i worked on it for close to an hour and i consider myself pretty good at these things ! \) i could not get the clips to tighten properly they continued to be loose even with using the smaller screws perhaps my stroller tubing is too small \? \? \? very unlikely but it just might be the case this is going back to the store where i will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for 5 a package of two \( thick \) s hooks for 3 and my child will have to learn to deal with holding her snack cup and straw cup i will save myself 10 a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items ! ! ! do yourself a favor and do n't bother with this product ! ! !	6
0	i have worn jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time the product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them ! i shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings given the cost of panties and other similar products you 'd think the quality would be decent however jockey is n't the only company out there with a substandard product i guess until i can afford to spend substantially more for panties i'm stuck i will only pay sale prices	6
1	this sinus rinse works great and it 's easy to use great price from amazon and quick shipping	6
1	this is an hbo remake of the original 50 's 50 footer naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era however it still captures the thrills and chills you may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever \( rats \) nancy \( the little woman \) does not have quite the devoted husband here life is not quite ideal soon a chance encounter with aliens \( the space type \) leaves her feeling bigger about the situation 50 foot bigger now it is nancy 's turn for a little revenge the ending is a little unnerving be sure to see daryl in just as serious of a role in high spirits \( 1998 \)	6

0	run as fast as you can do not try ! okay so i bought in to the hype of blow out once i saw the jonathan product line on the shelf i thought hmmm how yummy ! boy was i disappointed the moisturizing shampoo was anything but ! the product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue once applied to the hair i felt knots forming upon rinsing my hair like it had been stripped ! i used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act but was left aghast when i rinsed and felt the new texture of my hair i could n't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until i applied a leave in conditioner from another product line ! once dry my hair felt gritty brittle and generally nasty i'm taking this stuff back and demanding a refund ! i'm going back to my frederick fekkai products immediately	7

1	i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product other than offering more color combinations would be to make it bulletproof which it damn near is already a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory although 15 might come across as steep for such a small product the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds the 100 shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it 's category	7
0	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	7
1	if you burn lots of calories in your activities this high energy food could give you a lift there are 250 calories packed into this little 2 4 ounce bar which is advertised to be at least 70 organic this bar is advertised to be for athletes first and as a casual snack second if you are overweight and trying to drop pounds you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn when i opened this bar i noticed that it looks like compressed goop however the compressed goop tastes pretty good the texture is much like a granola bar though more moist than a granola bar the black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated there are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor which is a big plus i was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial which is an even bigger plus one thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy i guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross contamination from some other process in either case vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product the label also states that there may be traces of peanuts this bar also contains 20 of the daily recommended dietary fiber which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar there are also lots of vitamins and trace elements which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing clif bars could be a casual snack but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities if you fall into that category which could include hiking climbing bicycling running jogging and other similarly strenuous activities then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package enjoy !	7

1	this is such a versatile chair love the way you can fold it down compactly yet it 's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used the tray stores on the back legs when not in use nice touch for the reviewer who complained that the thing that separates the legs is attached to the tray you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray plus it 's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up my 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime	7
0	i bought this product on my mom 's suggestion because she was impressed with the suction power not only did the suction power fade over the first few months of ownership but within 6 months the vacuum was completely broken i called in to customer service because it was still under warranty and they were anything but helpful they sent me to a small shop 45 minutes away to have it fixed which took over a month they even lost my paperwork one month later it broke again and customer service suggested i take it out in my backyard take the vacuum apart and blow the small holes with an air compressor to clean it out for 400 this is ridiculous i want my 100 vacuum back	7

0	i used to enjoyed discover but the past several months of their radicals changes got me to think a real dumbing down once in awhile they would put together a good article but not constantly how can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage there are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv discover 's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube thank goodness scientific american astronomy sky and telescope science news havent fallen down i am not renewing my subscription unless discover 'rediscovers' itself how dumb americans are !	7

0	the gloves looked great online but in actually the quality of the product was not what i imagined the gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm instead it had a thin sheet of nylon the closure was not secure enough so i was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on on the bright side the gloves were pretty and i had no problems returning the product back to amazon com	7

1	i reach for ck one on days that i want a crisp fresh scent intended to be a unisex fragrance it is not at all sweet or flowery however it does have a softness to it that i personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man i find it to be slightly musky without being masculine overall this is a really nice neutral fragrance for everyday wear	7
1	note 4 1 2 stars is what i mean this is one of the most gorgeous films you will ever see you can watch this film without sound or subtitles and still be enraptured the breathtaking landscapes the gorgeous use of colors the wonderful costume design the stunning dance and fight choreography will captivate you like few films do the musical score is excellent it enhances the mood of the scenes even further the acting is also very convincing your hearts will go out to these characters the story is simple but has some interesting twists and is told very well compared to most movies there is very little dialogue but you wo n't miss it words are never wasted every line seems essential my only qualm is with the final unfolding of events which are not bad but were not up to the level of the rest of the film target audience anyone who does n't mind subtitles	7
0	oh those were the days when i was in college reading my first issues and then subscribing there were great things to be found in its pages columns by brian crozier russell kirk erik von kuenhelt leddhin \( sp \? \) the great struggle with the soviet union was going into a critical stage it seemed nr was so on the right track and it was wonderful to read at least from about 1979 to 1983 but then it became for a while duller it had some periods of recrudescence such as under the editorship of john o'sullivan but when rich lowry took over nr really began to dumb down \( nothing personal mr lowry \) but what i 've really discovered of late is how badly the neo con agenda has sort have taken over the magazine we 've got in the 50th anniversary issue a call by midge dector to rally the country to our illegal and immoral war in iraq really something has happened to the magazine a sinister force has entrenched itself there what is that force \? well go to come and hear com and you will begin to learn part of the picture especially when you read the material by elizabeth dilling i would also recommend paul findley 's they dare to speak out which details the israeli lobby 's domination of our congress nr was once a courageous conservative magazine but now it has been heavily tainted by the influence of a terrible thing wfb should know better and maybe he does if he does n't then he should pick up neo conned ! and neo conned again ! and then he should listen to tony martin 's talk given to the ihr on a certain group 's tactics deployed to suppress free speech what has inspired me to write this review is wfb 's recent column on the incarceration of david irving it ends in a disgusting gloating wfb has fallen into an evil trap and so has the magazine he used to run what has happened to the christian faith of people like buckley \? he now seems lost and terribly afraid of offending that supposedly saintly interest group and you mr lowry come on now read widely and deeply and do n't be afraid of reading the talmud and about the israeli lobby once you do maybe you 'll develop the strength to think outside the box we 're going to have to do that if we want anything but the bleakest future for mankind and the planet	7
0	the straightener works ok it straightens my hair better when it is dry i have very course hair i still had to blow dry it to get it to straighten out and go over it a few times to really make it straight the remington is to thick so you can not style the hair at all with it the worst part about this particular straightener is when i leave it plugged in and have it shut off it keeps making a beeping sound \? \? i have to unplug it to make it stop i just bought a chai straightner for about three times the cost of this it is only 1 inch thick so it styles the hair very nice but it straightens my hair the same as the remington i have only had it a few weeks so i am intrested to see if the chai causes less damage as it claims then other straighteners	7

0	unit gives inconsistant results especially with front projection sets spyder also requires room to be as dark as possible in order to make adjustments this is not always practical the tripod mount fits too loose on spyder and easily falls off i think this is a good beginning to a potentially fine product but not yet ready for prime time	7
1	works as billed i am currently playing a dvd rl that would not play on any other player i have not purchased a 1080p lcd tv but it is why i purchased an upconverting dvd player i have tried dvd r and dvd rw i will be trying audio formats later i would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the hd versus blueray to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down	7
1	the only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus especially where there is not adequate light aside from this it is a good but not great lens it is probably worth the money that it cost however i believe that a better lens would be the 70 300 mm vr which costs about 4x the price of this lens	7
1	learn catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base however i have taken about 5 years of spanish and found the cd to be fairly basic and while catalan differs in many ways many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope there are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist i definitely have benefitted from this cd because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it overall great for beginners and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge	7

0	i would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool you do n't have to clean 2 out of the cup and you 'll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink it really saves a lot of hastlemy mother in law and i both bought this potty for my daughter \( one for her house and one for mine \) it was hard for me to put together my mo in law could n't get it together at all it makes a loud trumpet sound every time water passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died the other thing i 'd like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die they are almost impossible to replace in order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart which again is very hard to put back together we got ours on sale so i do n't mind the expenditure when you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops	7

0	i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost you truly get what you pay for and this thing is n't worth a plug nickel i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was 300mm \( 480mm on a digital rebel xt \) incredibly soft even stopped down i would never want to make an enlargement from it stay away do n't believe the fools who are novices you will be disappointed with this lens you 're much better off to buy the older used 100 300mm 5 6 \( the l version costs more too \) but both are so much better than this junker you 're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo 's with this lens handheld having switched from nikon when switching to digital i almost judged canon from this one lens which i'm glad i did n't do n't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did this lens also had terrible purple fringing almost as bad as the kit 18 55mm after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses canon 10 22mmcanon 28 105mm \( 3 5 version \) canon 100 300mm \( 5 6 non l version \) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it the kit 18 55mm makes usable shots but when i could afford it i sold it too you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100 300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75 300mm lens	7
1	and you will to this music conveys the happy feeling of latin music produced for the american ear from 1946 to 1949 i picked up the album from amazon after listening to selected cuts offered by the yahoo music radio service el cumbanchero and cuban pete the cuts are almost all strong and all are well recorded especially when you compare the sound quality to those on some other big band recordings that have been reissued babalu which became desi arnez signature piece on the i love lucy tv show is probably one of the least appealing and that may be why it was used comedically in the tv show through the years the highlight cuts include peanut vender holiday in havana you can in yucatan and brazil while brass strings drums and guitars tend to dominate much of today 's music this album gives the spotlight to a variety of percussion instruments flute clarinet and bass clarinet it is refreshing to hear them in solo the liner notes by will friedwald are extensive and give you a glimpse into this period of desi 's life between his movie career and the defining work he and lucille ball did on television in the 50 's i could not recommend this album more and hope you enjoy it as much as i did	7
1	a documentary about the making of a film that never got past the shooting of a couple of scenes does n't seem to promise much but the story of what was to turn out to be a real life disaster movie is riveting stuff terry gilliam 's obsession with don quixote is infectious and his enthusiasm for the task he faces coupled with glimpses of what it could have been really make you wish that things had turned out better the insights into how a film is planned and the hugely complex logistics of a live shoot are fascinating while the build up to the almost inevitable collapse of the project compounded by unbelievably bad weather and the illness of the central actor coupled with the impacts of it all on those involved is about as far removed from the typical self congratulatory making of the movie add on as you can get finally the whole sorry affair in particular gilliam 's persistent unbridled optimism in the face of virtually insurmountable odds as he pursues the chance to realise a long standing dream becomes a quite bizarre tragi comic parallel to don quixote itself you may only watch this once and renting is therefore probably the best option but you wo n't be disappointed	7
1	this matcha green tea powder is delicious ! it does come slightly pre sweetened so people who do not wish to consume any sugar may need to be aware also sometimes the package has mo cha on the label which is 'chinese' for green tea \( exactly the same as matcha green tea \) i used this powder to make a green tea smoothie frappe and it tasted great highly recommend	7

1	i replaced our old ocean wonders aquarium soother with this rainforest waterfall version about a month and a half ago the aquarium was still working and our baby liked the lights and music but i was looking for something that would play for a longer period of time with the aquarium i had to go in her room and press the button a couple of times before she would fall back asleep not fun at 3 or 4 in the morning when all i want to do is fall back asleep i had read that the waterfall soother plays for up to 18 minutes so i thought i 'd check it out the soother has 3 different length settings lights music sounds and movement for 6 minutes lights and music sounds for 12 minutes music sounds only for 18 minutes there are 3 settings for the sounds rainforest sounds without music rainforest sounds and lullabies rainforest sounds and classical music there are 3 volume settings as well i have ours set for 12 minutes of sounds and lullabies and i rarely have to go back in her room and press the button a second time she almost instantly settles down once the music starts if i happen to put her down for a nap or for bed while she 's still awake she 'll quietly watch the lights and fall asleep on her own and i 'll admit that hearing the songs and rainforest noises over the baby monitor is soothing and relaxing as i try to fall back asleep my only complaint is that the lights seem really bright for something that is supposed to lull a baby to sleep i ended up covering ours with a light flannel blanket to dull the light a bit the baby ca n't see the critters but since i do n't have them set to move it 's not really a big deal despite the bright lights we 're happy with this soother	7
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	7
0	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11 inch apertures so i expected better i ordered this for my daughter it arrived defective the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket making collimation impossible in celestron 's defense it likely happened in transit amazon 's return policy is not a hassle and i'm upgrading her to another telescope i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	7
1	this is a nice toy for kids to ride on my daughter loves the little horn there are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music that does not work well at all there are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either it 's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features do n't work well worth the buy if a family is really into the john deere theme	7
1	i'm so technically challenged and i had no trouble figuring out this system i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it altogether they were a bit pricey but worth every penny ! very easy to understand the directions and lots of bells and whistles lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description i love the intercom features they are great for when the kids are upstairs i do n't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them very cool	7
1	this fragrance starts off fine but the longer you wear the better it gets and that very nice smell lasts a wonderfully long time ! !	7
0	does n't tell you how to get anywhere when used with a gps simply shows you where you are nothing more than a glorified paper map a complete embarassment	7
1	i guess the reason i enjoyed the movie so much was because i went into the theatre expecting a good drama and that 's exactly what i got the story was very interesting to me i enjoyed the relationships between the villagers especially lucious and ivy the scary moments just added to the drama having grown up in the country i know how scary the woods can be i loved all the twists to the story the only thing i did n't like was william hurt 's performance it was too hammy i think if this critical role had been cast by another actor the movie would 've moved along at a better pace but still a great movie	7

0	la grange is probably at the top of most zz top fans lists and rightly so as it is superb but the version contained on this collection is the one where they did some weird digital reverb stuff to the drum track which completely destroyed the roadhouse vibe of the original recording it is so awful that i do n't know how anybody can listen to it thankfully they got smart and went back to the original for rancho texicano clueless classic rock stations are still playing the version contained here dummies also waitin' on the bus jesus just left chicago are two absolutely essential tracks that are inexplicably missing here	7
0	this product offers much to chose from and i really liked the photos however i have yet to get this program to work right i am able to view the photos but when i go into the the export wizard to save the photos the photo has a transparency over the top of it instead of in the background i tried bypassing the export wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving this also inserts the transparency over the photo i called hemera in canada and they instructed me to call encore usa in ca for support encore usa said they could n't help me encore 's technical support is limited to crashes error messages and lockups i also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or faq 's there was very little about this software and no help to be found i wasted my money on a product i ca n't use and that offers no support for issues out of my control	7
1	this is a pretty good camera loaded with lots of features the pros include the 10x optical zoom use of sd card and battery consumption also with this camera you have the ability to buy add ons such as zoom lenses and such makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience there are a couple of cons that i 've found the most important being the picture quality although it does have the capability to take great photos you have to make sure and wait several seconds between shots to ensure that they 'll come out looking great \( in my opinion anyway \) the size is okay although it is kinda bulky for being so small i prefer something that size to also be slim it 's not so easy to carry around because of this overall this camera is very easy to use	7
1	i 've had this digital camera for almost a year it 's the fourth camera i 've owned i spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that i could carry everywhere being an amateur photographer \( and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others \) i did n't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera it fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse \( for formal nights out \) the size and weight of this camera is its best feature and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera too this has been the perfect camera for everything from selling items on line to landscape scenery my pictures have always turned out beautifully with wonderful color and crispness i have discovered that the automatic lighting feature is not always the most ideal but you can re program just about anything on this camera it 's really quite a good camera and given its price these days with the newer generations out there it 's a steal	7
1	i bought the natural flavour did n't find it very palatable the first time but the next time was much better and now i am hooked on to it ! an acquired taste indeed ! the 11 ounce is difficult to down in one go though	7
0	looks nice when it was standing took several hours to erect doing it by myself had 20 mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and i had to throw it all out wrote to the company because it was only 2 weeks after i received it and heard nothing back so if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy but if not say goodbye	7

0	starforce nothing else need be said starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games i do n't know since not a single one will play on a dell xps gaming laptop	7
0	the e550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed you must have the camera 's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens so this means if the subject is moving around a lot such as my daughter playing soccer you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you ca n't zoom out as long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful i unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off etc another negative is that the viewfinder does n't show the zoomed in image you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot which can be difficult in bright sunlight	7

1	i'm not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about \( sounds like someone with an axe to grind \) but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship the music is inspired the melodies transcending and the emotion deep and meaningful as far as copying yanni goes well i do n't agree in fact yanni is far more generic and less inspired the sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact not the same nor are they yanni 's creation i write this review to commend mr farish on his work and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and could n't resist his own urge to see his critique in print ryans music is distinctly his own no question and any similarities are tonal and not compositional which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of as far as i'm concerned you be the judge and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve 's and websites for music to criticize and well make themselves feel a little better personally i would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy all the other stuff is for hacks ! enjoy this music ! i do	7

0	i bought this wok 6 months ago i seasoned it very well and started to use it but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce it meant i could n't use it for steaming when i made a fried rice i had a hard time to clean it and re season it most chinese use a wok to cook everything so i expected i could do that too but i was wrong this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry that 's all	7

1	i'm used to using a teflon coated electric griddle that has much more space than the baby q griddle cooking eggs and pancakes on the cast iron proved challenging and everything cooked much faster \( too fast at first \) the lack of a drain hole made cooking the bacon very greasy it got to the point where i had to remove the bacon remove the griddle dump the grease and continue cooking on the plus side the griddle fits perfectly and the included chrome handles make removing the griddle safe and effortless	7
1	i just transformed it for the first time into a truck it was challenging but doable probably one of the coolest toys ever but i was an 80 's child as someone else mentioned the grill in front does not quite align with the cab windows when it 's all set but other than that it 's great tremendous amount of detail \( moveable leg vents head mouth individual fingers thumb poseable light behind matrix datacom interface working shocks on the wheels and accessories \) it 's quite tall and heavy for a toy very impressive if a piece snaps off from forcing it the wrong way it is designed to snap back on i never got to own a transformer as a teen but my lost childhood is now officially redeemed this will adorn my office cube as a conversation piece	7
0	i purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last march i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support they went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up well i followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been so they said i should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it then i sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there they sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing well i just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem they never fixed the problem mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son 's life before the age of 2 i called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor she said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera well i was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late august a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped she said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera i told i have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before i sent it in the first time i started to cry that my son 's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when i got off the phone the camera is worse than a disposable camera do n't waste your time or money on this piece of junk i recommend olympus my olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk i am planning on contacting the better business bureau regarding this matter please do n't waste your time on this like i have to ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could have forecasted this for me	7

1	we have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights as well as on many car trips at home and abroad it is great ! it is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars on some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom but the cushioning is adequate my son has never complained he seems very comfortable in it baby bargains recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby and i am online ordering one for my daughter right now if you expect to travel this seat is an essential it is light enough that lugging it around airports cruiseships and such is not a total pain \( although as with any seat it is nice to have a bag we 've done it both with and without \)	7

0	warmth from window affects thermometer ! d'oh ! it 's totally inaccurate on single pane glazing very inaccurate on dual pane glazing and still slightly inaccurate when mounted on a jerri rigged 6 extender from dual pane glass the nature of windows being a big source of heat loss means this thermometer is measuring warm ambient air not actual outside temperature	7
0	while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book it reminds me of the story the emperor has no clothes yes choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying the flipping back and forth was not accomplished in a smooth flowing manner in addition the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone	7
1	this is a fun game if your inti the mechs the graphics are good but like the first halo game type the difficulty level are weak to easy to kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs and then varients of those ones that just have differnet weapons loadout the multiplayer is good but not great	7

1	oh how i love the most delicious incredible edible fruit of the plant cucumis sativus who would 've thought that this was a member of the gourd family cucurbitaceae a cousin of the melon \? cucumbers have many great uses they 're delicious in salads and is there any snack tastier than a pickle \? i also hear they have non culinary uses as well some say cucumbers help to reduce the swelling around eyes or the bags under the eyes maybe that 's because they 're 90 water i 've also heard that there are more adult uses for the cucumber but i 've only seen that in movies	7

1	i 've had this camera for three years i bought it new when it was cutting edge and very expensive i put a 128mb cf card in it first i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software i 've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it it 's been all over the country the software has been installed on windows 95 98 2000 and xp and i have n't had any problems with it the camera is solid performs well takes good pictures and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder if battery life were that big a deal one could purchase a second battery and rotate all that said i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera they are razor sharp the color balance is perfect and the focus is great when taking pictures of people however it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin scratches oil freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific it requires extensive photoshopping to fix the flaws other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture by the time the shot 's taken something \( especially a squirmy child or a sports play \) has invariably moved and it 's not the exact picture you wanted i'm going to buy a real single lens reflex \( slr \) to take baby pictures but i 'll keep this as a travel camera	7

1	i bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day this is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves some of the honeycombs get a little crushed but i 've found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them reese 's puffs and cheerios also came out without any crushing you have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh maybe this was in the directions but i missed it and learned the hard way but the kids figured out the caps easily and it 's not a big deal for them	7

0	i first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine i fell in love with both the bottle and the scent instantaneously i decided when i had some extra cash i would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for christmas christmas came and went and no fantasy instead i recieved celine dion 's fragrance i liked the smell of the dion but was still sad that i did n't get what i wanted i decided to buy the fantasy for myself upon finding it at a makeup counter i became rather thankful i got the other i think fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray i had in elementary school mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again the bottle is elegant but the scent is juvenile it 'd be appropriate for preteens but not grown women then again should i be surprised \? i suppose the scent caters well to spears' followers 12 year olds	7

0	playboy made a mark in its day about 40 years ago today it is a totally unneeded magazine its concept of a mixture of quality articles mixed in with naked photos so that the reader will not feel quilty looking at the photos because he wanted to read an interesting article is actually quite goofy the end result is that the articles and the photos are lukewarm	7

1	while volume 1 of the dream babes series is more accessible with its very girly girl group pop sun shiney vocals volume 2 offers a little bit of everything from pop r b girl group vocals pop swinging pop even some very early school grrl rock 'n roll they might be a little more lyrically serious \( hence the subtitle reflections \) but if anything that 's a good thing it 's nice to hear that women were trying different styles and genres and not just singing about about boys and also know these are not just timepieces to be admired from a distant these are all still fun interesting and downright cool to hear again or for the first time if you 're a collector this whole series should be on your checklist	7

1	final fantasy iii as most may know was the only final fantasy game that failed to reach north america well now it haas been revived and it 's better than ever before ! the improved 1 \) final fantasy has pushed the ds 's graphics to the limit though the figures may not be crystal clear and though it may seem slightly pixelish it 's probably the best you 'll ever get for the nintendo ds ffiii is completely 3d a step up from it 's original and the character changes appearence as you change his her job ! 2 \) the job system is what solely drives this game as some may have read yes there are 279841 different party combinations obviously this opens up many doors and many strategy ffiii incorperates these 23 jobs in a smart way as well do n't be suprised when some job adjustments must be made to defeat a certain boss your party can be all fighting or all magic all range or all skills or a mix of any ! jobs are earned when crystals are discovered and you will find a use for each of them 3 \) ffiii can be played entirely with the touch screen or entirely with the buttons so you can use either method whenever you want ffiii complements the ds 's touch screen capability quite nicely being able to use it to select moves is much better than the buttons 4 \) ffiii is also wi fi compatible in it players can send messages to other players global using an internet port it is n't much but it 's something ! 5 \) you may name all of your characters and play as any or them any time ! i like that freedom the things that could be better 1 \) the story line is very redundant and a copy of previous ff games it is n't a big deal but you 'd think tthey 'd get a bit more original ! 2 \) the command buttons during battle are very small so using the touch screen often makes you mis hit a command 3 \) this game requires lots of patience because the battles are very tedious sometimes and most gameplay is spent traing 4 \) each job does n't have a variety of skills but rather only one it gets very old once you maintain the same job for a long time 5 \) the wi fi is n't very creative and there is no 2 player in ffiii 6 \) fights do not incorperate time bars that is to say you can take 5 years to make a move without an attack from an enemy to make it short and sweet die hard ff fans must get this game mainly to complete their ff colections but also for a great time not a die hard fan \? no worries the rpg is the best you 'll find on the ds or psp it 's got plenty to do and wo n't fail you at any time those who do n't enjoy strategy games however or do not have the patience to grow their characters may want to stay away from this game i loved it but hey it 's just what i think this review was brought to you by the son of having fun	7
0	i usually love the first years products i already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it i wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so i thought i 'd try this one i was expecting to love the swing feature it was the one thing i thought was missing out on the fisher price one well i returned this chair w in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one here are the reasons why the base of the chair is hollow and wobbly it is also very wide and did n't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair you have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide at their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out and then you wipe baby 's hands as you 're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off he 's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray the back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down you have to take the chair apart to adjust the level and when folded up it 's not as compact and portable as fisher price 's model do yourself a favor and splurge the extra 5 for the healthy care booster seat	7

0	what is it with these gossip magazines \? \? please tell me because i truly think no one in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage all it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds while not having anything important else in the magazine unless your 10 years old do not subscribe to this there are better magazines out there fortunately like seventeen and cosmogirl ! which are n't nearly as filled with garbage like this the reason you do n't see j 14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people it 's for little kids and it 's not mature period	7
1	a well crafted comprehensive look at the role of islam in turkey the book offers some original and compelling explanations regarding the social transformation that turkey has experienced since the 1980s specifically the author mentions the role of opportunity spaces in the evolution of islamic movements and ideas as a result of economic and political liberalization i think anyone who is interested in turkey islamic movements and the relationship between islam and modernity would get a great deal out of this book	7
0	the program works fine on windows xp and is easy to use it lets you print cards of many sizes the big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program the back of the box claims quot 4500 cards and sentiments celebrate life 's special moments with cards for all occasions quot that 's nice the problem with that is that i counted the total number of cards that come with the program it only adds up to 1045 ! so where are the other 3450 cards and sentiments \? are you supposed to design them yourself \? i just do n't know and certainly quot cards for all occasions quot means just that does n't it \? well there 's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind i guess you just need to buy those on your own	7
0	the principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews i was never able to get the card to do anything i tried removing and reinstalling the drivers i tried getting assistance through the web site i tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call i 've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card	7

1	i have mixed feelings about philosophy products for one thing they have really done a number on my skin as far as drying certain areas of my skin out on the other hand i use to have a very congested skin and nose area but i have noticed a huge difference in the congestion of my skin when using when hope is not enough serum i have n't noticed any lifting but the line between my eyebrows has softened as far as reducing facial hair growth do n't count on it i am only giving this 4 stars because even though it has helped keep my congestion under control it has n't done much more than that and i think it is a bit pricy for being just an exfoliator	7
1	boasting three shuddery tales ranging from gorgeous michelle mercier 's steamy telephone love triangle to boris karloff in top form as an eerie russian vampire to a sublimely creepy drop of water this is one of the scariest horror films ever made the great mario bava outdid himself with this superbly atmospheric 1963 film which was recut rescored and dubbed by aip in such a way that the film as a whole and the telephone segment in particular was drastically altered from the original version presented here it 's a pleasure to finally enjoy this film as bava intended it to be seen this dvd version has only the original italian soundtrack with english subtitles which is a shame since some of the actors are clearly speaking english on screen a dubbed english soundtrack would have been a anice extra along with les baxter 's excellent us musical score but even so what 's here is worth every penny the extra scenes of karloff in the studio are a treat and once seen the restless corpse from the drop of water is never forgotten i have left this review deliberately vague on plot points so as not to spoil the movie for those who have not yet seen it but suffice to say that black sabbath is a masterwork that belongs in every horror fan 's collection	7

1	i did n't expect to like this book after reading the first 30 of 196 pages the graphic detail used to describe a murder and the early decomposition of two dead bodies made me wonder where in the heck this story could go and more importantly why would i want to read it ! where does the story go \? it 's a wandering timetable we know the two main characters joseph and celice both professors of zoology married for 30 years are dead and the forward movement not only includes their ongoing decay but also their eventual discovery by police dogs and the introduction of their grown daughter syl as she copes with her knowledge of their death it also goes back to when they first met as students sharing a study house at the shore they are an unlikely pair and yet they come together through mutual attraction and what turns out to be a shared tragic experience and live at least according to their estranged daughter an unremarkable life the timetable further allows the reader to relive the last day of their lives hour by hour from the murder back to the moment they awoke and decided to spend the day together at the very shore where they 'd met some 30 years earlier the layout of the story was brilliant and not in the least bit confusing the language \( british english \) is both lofty and gritty probably not unlike joseph and celice some of the thoughtful insights about life and death are very very poignant for example when syl contemplates the loss of her parents her gene supplies had closed shop their daughter was the next in line she could not duck out of the queue so she should not waste her time in this black universe the world 's small breathing denizens its quaking congregations and its stargazers were fools to sacrifice the flaring briefness of their lives in hopes of paradise or fears of hell no one transcends there is no future and no past there is no remedy for death or birth except to hug the spaces in between live loud live wide live tall i thought it was a very elegant way of illustrating both the fact that life always goes marching on and the importance of our obligation to the dead \( and dying \) that we live life well the title and thesis of the book are one and the same being dead highly recommend from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group	7

1	in truth there really has n't been a great mana game since secret of mana back in 1993 every mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings and children of mana is no different why did i buy it knowing this \? for the same reason many mana fans continue to invest in mana games there 's always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that secret of mana did unfortunately children of mana does not do this it does n't rekindle the magic secret of mana gave us but that should n't suggest it falls short of it either the world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages it is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you 'll set out to save the mana tree and the world itself children of mana by no means has a great storyline going for it at least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in gameplay no matter how you look at it children of mana is a dungeon crawler it is an rpg but it falls into the dungeon crawling category when you enter dungeons they 're just swarming with monsters and you 'll be surrounded before you know it so you 'll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss take him on and then you 're done rinse and repeat the process does at times become annoying but children of mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the gameplay to make up for it the first tidbit of interest is how combat works it 's actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things it 's surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours you 've got three hit combos you can perform on enemies you can knock enemies into other enemies there 's quite a bit of intersting things you can do however what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you ca n't ahead of yourself too fast first and foremost you ca n't equip and use everything you find right off the bat the game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations this keeps the game from being too simple you 'll also have access to magic of course each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you it 's interesting to play around with as well in dungeons you can also dual wield weapons although not in the way you 'd think when i say duel wield i specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time so you ca n't go about swinging both of them at the same time which probably would 've added more variety to the gameplay otherwise along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities it 's interesting but not really all that deep you 'll mostly find or purchase these gems another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many sidequests the game has to offer children of mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on and they 're actually pretty well worth it the problem with the gameplay however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast the objective in just about every dungeon is to find what 's called a gleam drop and then bring it back to the gleam well it 's annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way fight through a horde of enemies retrieve the gleam drop fight a boss and leave over time it becomes increasingly repetative however children of mana has a great remedy for that too it 's multiplayer up to four players can play at a time and the game is so much more fun that way you and your friends can make your way through dungeons together and sometimes it 's just a blast to do there are moments of slowdown when playing in multiplayer mode but it 's nothing to get too frustrated with because it does n't happen too often the multiplayer alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the gameplay as far as graphics go the game does n't look too bad the sprites look like they 're ripped straight ouf of sword of mana and the game is completely 2d however the mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit they 've been about its unique art style which in children of mana is absolutely gorgeous it 's artwork is just beautiful to look at each environment is given extremely good detail the only problem as i mentioned are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed musically children of mana sounds fantastic it 's one of the best sounding ds games out to date very few of the current games hold a candle up to it 's fantastic soundtrack the bottom line is simple children of mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline there 's just enough variety and interest in the gameplay to keep one going for the adventure even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with however keep in mind that children of mana really is just a dungeon crawl and it 's uncrealistic to expect an rpg that 's all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away on the whole if you 're looking for a game that 's fun you 'll find it with children of mana however if you 're looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters you wo n't find it in children of mana the good beatiful artwork fantastic soundtrack there 's a lot of variety to the gameplay multiplayer is a blasts tons of sidequests to dothe bad the storyline is n't good the gameplay has a lot of vareity but it 's hard to get past the fact that it 's repetativ	7

0	do not buy this planning to leave it outside on your grill ! there were warnings with this product saying that it should n't be left outside but i figured it could n't be that bad a couple months later i discovered that my cutting board \( left on a covered porch through a mild california winter \) had completely split into several pieces for a 30 outdoor product this is really unacceptable a plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better	7
0	we purchased this camera and overall it was a good camera it took excellent outside video and was not a great performer in low light conditions but that is not atypical of today 's reasonably priced minidv camcorders however after six months the lcd screen suddenly stopped working it was not mishandled and the otherwise the camera works great we sent it last november to the panasonic authorized service center they returned it three months later unrepaired because the part is not available we were out 100 in labor fees plus we still have a broken camera that is less than a year old i only share this as a warning to potential buyers panasonic did not honor our warranty	7

1	this is a great mascara it does n't get clumpy but it leaves your lashes fuller longer and it lasts without flaking or smudging well worth the price which is surprisingly lower than most other department store brands	7
0	there is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the faq section of the sony website if there are dust particles floating in the air they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white round glare spots this symptom tends to occur in low light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly however this is not a malfunction read your low light pictures will have spots all over them ! sony does not think this is a problem it is a design flaw if you are only going to use this camera in full sun then it is fantastic but seriously there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job !	7
1	this item was very nice the chain was longer than i expected and hangs really low on my neck but it only looks like the real one you can tell that it is a knock off but you get what you pay for for 5 i think that it was worth it but it does look different than the real one good service and delivery	7

1	i purchased this cd during the lowest time of my life emotionally every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief especially the title track deep peace i would listen to it over and over bathing in the lush healing sounds each element from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs is seemingly structured at a spiritual level this is more than ambient music it 's true music therapy	7

0	i am a 23 yr old mother of a 2 1 2 yr old not only are these children horrible singers but there is a reason that most parents do n't let their children listen to the original songs they teach them things they do n't need to know i thought this would be a kids version that would get rid of that stuff when i let a child i was babysitting put the cd on and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children they did n't take that out ! children are exposed to that every day in our world now telling them it is normal and ok parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today it becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for kids that teaches them that those things are normal they assume if it is ok for a kids cd it ca n't be that bad i think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child ! some of the songs i like in the originial version and do listen to and this cd has ruined them ! but when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and does n't mean what they say is ok i think it is the worst thing you could buy for your child	7

1	turbo tax deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return it 's very annoying to find and adjust the state return once you have gone back into your federal return i think it is a very good product but they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas especially for the state return	7
0	dan fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer unfortunately the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts songs that seem formulaic and quot safe quot his best songs are the lesser known works listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them they 'll never make it to the pop airwaves serious fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd quot greatest hits quot is not synonymous with quot greatest music quot	7

0	that so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me luckily i bought this book used otherwise i might be kicking myself for paying full price between her utterly uninspired devotional dances to things such as sex wisdom and the sticky one \( a term she made up for the astral body \) and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to anoint it i was unimpressed to say the least however driving on a trip a friend and i got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book it 's very very amusing if you do n't take it seriously the thing that makes me sad is that she 's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth there 's nothing evolutionary about it unless you consider being a wanton idiotic freak evolutionary if this is what humanity is evolving into i am frightend	7
1	when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play this was how i learned how to play the game i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above \( 90 's style \) unfortunately they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90 's style if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me	7
1	the only complaint i have with my gas smoker is that it was damaged when delivered \( this was also the case of a friend of mine who ordered the same smoker \) it was dented in several places i have cooked as many as 12 whole chickens at on time and they all came out fully cooked and juicey it 's a great way to cook just put your meat on adjust your heat then set back and visit with your guest while the smoker does all the work after people have tasted my smoked faire they always ask where i got my smoker several of my friends have bought this smoker for their own use	7

1	because it felt like it predicted that i 'd be listening to the cd someday i'm referring to the line the kids of ad 2000 will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today now i admit that i was 18 in 2000 so i guess i technically missed the literal kid description by a year but the more general prediction of the inter generational timeless appeal of the beatles was right on i did n't see them on the ed sullivan show i was born almost twelve years after they broke up and about a year after the tragic shooting of john lennon but i like many many other people born too late to have experienced beatlemania as it was occuring have since become a huge fan of all their work this album has my favorite of all the beatle 's songs i 'll follow the sun that song alone is worth the five stars but thankfully the rest of the album is great too this album gets a little bit too much grief and it may not be quite as amazing as something like abbey road but it 's still better than just about anything else out there	7

0	i have enjoyed many of mark 's novels \( do you know that i love you is my favorite of the bunch \) all the time recognizing his severe limitations as a writer every character in every roeder novel speaks with the same voice all of them and though his dialog is usually age appropriate for his teen characters his narrative passages invariably sound as if they were written by someone decades older there is frequent repetition and redudancy characters never say anything once if they can say it two or three or four times \( though he has definitely improved since his mediocre first novel ancient prejudice which had the unfortunate distinction of glamorizing teen suicide \) his characters always \( and i mean always \) mate for life which is a beautiful romantic ideal but ultimately can get tiresome \( gay teens are no different from straight ones in their need to play the field a bit before a lifetime commitment \) all that said at his best \( dykwik a better life keeper of secrets \) mark roeder writes a compelling and often un put downable story but in outfield menace the bad most definitely outweighs the good did mr roeder do any research into the time period \? \? \? the fifties are certainly a good setting for a gay teen novel \( if only as an educational experience for contemporary teens who do n't realize how impossible it was to be gay at that time \) but if you want to set a novel in the fifties do n't have a lead male character with a ponytail no one but no one wore a pony tail in the fifties \( and certainly not in a small midwest town \) do n't have characters use anachronisms like fifteen minutes of fame and most of all do n't have characters behave and think in anachronistic wasys mark roeder illustrates the dangers of self publishing he has apparently made a name for himself \( and some money i 'd guess \) and i must confess i 've bought his novels \( glutton for coming out stories that i am \) but no legitimate house would publish his novels at least not without major editing and rewriting something that a self published author \( especially one with an apparently inflated self image \) goes without there has been a renaissance in quality gay teen fiction this past year or two major publishers have put out such superb young adult novels as totally joe m or f \? the hookup artist rainbow road boy girl boy read them if only to see how these truly outstanding \( and published by legit houses \) novels could teach mark roeder a thing or two if you must read roeder then stick with his better novels and avoid this serious misstep memo to roeder if you want to write about a time you do n't know about do your research	7
0	the vacuum has great suction however suction is the only good quality about this vacuum i purchased this vacuum at sears and got a good discount during their vacuum sale but i have gone through 3 of these vacuums and have returned or plan on returning each one the 1st vacuum got so much dirt stuck behind and in the hepa filter the vacuum started making a sound like it was going to break the 2nd vacuum had a handle that was assembled badly so with each forward and backward pass the handle felt like it was going to come off this vacuum is hard to push you have to put the carpet setting at close to high for low carpeting on hard surfaces the vacuum is hard to push too ! this vacuum has a large dust cup with 2 sections the small compartment in the back of the dust cup is \( 1 high x 5 wide x 6 deep \) for the dirt the large front section collects the hair crumbs and other larger things you pick up off the floor in your home however dirt and fine particulate dust is what i collect in my vacuum and hoover only gives you that little compartment for the dirt so it gets caught in the vacuum behind the hepa filter you spend more time cleaning out the vacuum than you do vacuuming your carpet today i had to pick up the vacuum and shake it over the trash can to get most of the dirt out from behind the hepa filter even my husband noticed that this vacuum takes too much time to empty and clean out yes lots of dirt falls onto the vacuum when you remove the dust cup and is messy to clean up i have tried kenmore eureka and fantom in the past i plan on returning the 3rd vacuum once i get my dyson i purchased from hsn	7
1	i would give a high recommendation for this tv it is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you 're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie the morning or evening news or the late shows in high def dvd player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the tv at all the picture is outstanding and is n't that what really matters in the end \? \? ! ! the only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation the tv has an auto on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the tv once it goes on it you are use the hdmi as i am to get signal from your cable box you must have the tv input mode set to hdmi but you ca n't set the auto on to the hdmi input \( it must be a channel number \) the engineers just did n't think that one through all the way oh well still a great tv	7
1	davy crockett is one of walt disney 's most endeared and remembered live action characters from the television and silver screen as personified by fess parker this colorful and entertaining film was re edited from three segments of disney 's tv show for theatrical distribution parker with his coonskin cap and homespun drawl and witticism created a nationwide phenomenon in 1955 who can forget the ballad of davy crockett composed by george bruns and tom blackburn buddy ebsen played his sidekick george russel whose adventures take them from tennessee to washington d c to the alamo the film 's third act focusing on the defense of the alamo though well remembered is somewhat labored until we see the final image of davy crockett passing into legend and glory this straightforward and beautifully photographed film expounds the virtues of honesty integrity and bravery highly recommended family viewing personally produced by walt disney	7

0	the dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea the only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself i wish the case closed more tightly it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily overall tho aside from the annoyance of the lid for the price it was still worth purchasing because as i 've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection	7

1	this seatsaver is one of the few wide enough and tall enough for suvs in contrast to one of the other reviews \( and i am not affiliated with the seat manufacturer \) this seat does the job adequately and one should not post a poor rating without researching the specs measurements fit etc imho there is no quot universal quot seat saver or for that matter car seat that will fit every car this one manages to catch most of the itty bitty things that kids manage to somehow accumulate and is sturdy enough for the car seat not to make indentations on the actual seat and hence serves its purpose well	7

0	i really did n't enjoy this book i am half italian american and i 've read a few books about growing up in an italian american family in an effort to learn about my roots i have also read several books about 2nd generation americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is quot normal quot and their immigrant parents i normally enjoy such books but not this one i know that life was n't always a bowl of cherries for these familes but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible yet i could n't find anything about the daughters' lives that are really that bad or even different from many people 's lives in this country where is all the anger coming from \? i really do n't know this book is dark and depressing some say it is funny at times but i did n't think so i could n't even bring myself to finish it	7

1	2 fast 2 furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that does n't require you to have seen the original i saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out and having never seen the original i thought i would be lost and would n't enjoy myself as much as other people but on the contrary i left the experience much happier than when i came in this film is full of quick one liners that deserve a laugh the special effects and the car races will leave your mouth gaping open i have heard and read that people did n't appreciate this film as much because it seemed to focus more on a plot than the first film did rather than focus more on the races but overall i think the balance works well even thinking of the plot that we are left with i really ca n't see another time when a race would even be appropriate and as for people saying that this film is worse than the original i would have to disagree why \? frankly i have always been a firm believer than vin diesel is entirely overrated as an actor \( i mean c'mon have you seen the pacifier \? \) he 's nothing more than a meat head who while able to do pretty good fight scenes should leave the dialogue to someone else yes this film is for the younger crowd and there are numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place \( take the boat jumping as an example \) but there is no saying that an older person would n't enjoy it as well the only thing that i will say is that you really should n't go into this film expecting an oscar worthy performance or else you will be disappointed if you sit back and take this as the fun romp that it is however you will thoroughly enjoy yourself	7
1	the third installment since the rebirth of the classic series and presumably the final chapter in the sands of time saga the two thrones takes the best elements of the sands of time \( game one \) and warrior within \( its sequel \) and caps the franchise with style finesse and gameplay as sharp as a scimitar blade you once again assume the mantle of the nameless prince of persia returning home to babylon at long last to find it in ruins and its people at war with an army of sand monsters the prince also finds himself in the company of old friends and old enemies cursed he comes to find his body and soul split in two and periodically his wicked self known as the dark prince rises forth to wreak havoc and take control of the prince 's body the storyline is entertaining its characters more developed than in most video games and it strikes a nice balance between darkness and light heartedness something warrior within failed to achieve in essence it 's what you would get if you took the tone and presentation of games one and two and rolled them together as mentioned before the gameplay is not far from that either while the sands of time set the tone with its acrobatic platforming which remains pretty much in tact warrior within took that game 's weak combat mechanics and fleshed them out into something a little more interesting happily both elements are retained and improved upon in this new installment what 's more tenchu like stealth kills are now available while they 're far from perfectly executed \( sometimes they seem unresponsive \) they nonetheless offer a fresh twist and the opportunity to avoid hand to hand combat in many circumstances the dark prince is another significant addition regularly throughout the course of the game the prince transforms into this alter ego a sand monster version of himself that is able to use a weapon called the daggertail this weapon functions much like the belmont whip in a castelvania game allowing the dark prince to attack his enemies and also swing from poles and light fixtures to access new areas the prince could n't hope to reach while stronger than the prince in combat unfortunately for the dark prince he must sustain himself with a constant supply of sand power or succumb to death when it 's all been used up that makes these portions of the game more intense and on rare occasions a little more frustrating also new to the series are the chariot trials sequences during which the prince must escape via horse drawn wagons through hazardous environments at full speed ahead while they provide a nice change of pace when they do actually occur they are relatively few and the trial and error nature of them can lead to irritation there are only a few glaring flaws in thrones the sound effects and ambient music retain their inconsistent buggy feel too often the dialogue sputters and repeats like a broken record and the music kind of fades in and departs with little rhyme or reason as well the graphics suffer from some pretty blatant clipping problems the engine has aged pretty gracefully but it has aged at least the character designs and architecture go a long way keep you distracted from the occasional failings of the visuals prince of persia the two thrones is in many respects a very similar game to the two that have come before it therefore it 's not as novel as the first game to longtime followers but it does n't feel as long in the tooth as it might have at this stage thanks to the new gameplay additions and an entertaining continuation of the story it 's certainly a better game than warrior within more welcoming in almost every way this series has a lot of life in it and the two thrones is well worth your time and effort	7

1	my first blackberry and i love it ! i wanted to stop lugging around a phone and a rather heavy dell axim just to have contacts calendar and task to do list i wanted a phone that synched with outlook and was a great phone the pearl is definitely the best choice i did n't really care about internet music or camera but the cheapest 30 internet plan from cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly it 's just great ! i bought the 40 1gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it i use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it 's great to be able to instantly recognize who 's calling from the music camera is ok not great but ok and very nice to have for on the spot photos that you do n't want to lug around the regular digital for i actually emailed a picture on the spot very cool battery life is phenomenal so far however i'm not a heavy user and i used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day only cons so far are 1 \) getting used to the keypad believe what every one says about the intuitiveness of the keypad figuring out the correct word i 've followed other folks' advice and do n't really look at the words letter by letter i type a sentence and then look it works like a charm 9 times out of 10 that the keyboard correctly identifies each word still this type of entry is so different for a first time blackberry user but getting used to this is still better than using a stylus and touch screen like the axim 2 \) also having trouble with having to restart if i change a ringtone for someone i have to reseat the battery to get the change to take effect hmmm 3 \) volume when talking even on speakerphone is average not terrible but ok so far my reception is fine 4 \) i also wonder how long the track ball will last i'm not a heavy user and i still use it constantly i think i'm going to buy the insurance plan just in case these minor cons are far outweighed by a simply great phone that synchs with outlook and so very much more bye bye dell axim it 's true what some say i'm a crackberry because playing with this thing is addictive i 'll update this review again in 3 months or so but i do n't anticipate any problems my only regret is i did n't hold out until a red pearl came in stock at my local cingular kiosk i would honestly give this phone 4 5 out 5 stars if they let you	7

1	argento is an incarnation of everything that film is and everything that it could have been as conceived by lumiere after hitchcock and ray leone and fuller argento is the last true auteur to make genre films visually a film like profondo rosso calls upon the ghosts of the cinema because everything that is filmed objects and people alike take on the same importance and that this inevitably leads to the resolution of the mystery which is at the center of the film argento can only film something as itself and this is why he is an extraordinary filmmaker cinema is not an answer but a question and argento is the answer to eisenstein 's theory of film as violence violence not only in the images themselves but in the great void that awaits them a murder a painting a mother a son a mirror all of these things will lead to a beautiful composition of images in which the mystery of seeing the mystery of cinema the questions are resolved	7

1	i love a good intricate storyline in a game as much as the next person the rpg known for it 's generally intricate plotline is one of my favorite genres and to the incredible hulk ultimate destruction 's credit it does contain a story penned by a seasoned comicbook author and again to the game 's credit the story really is n't too bad \( fairly generic but servicable \) the script is voiced adequatly and presented in a way that does n't deter from the real focus of the game rampant wanton gratuitous destruction in some of the most creative ways possible i love the hulk as a character i even liked the ang lee flick \( no hate mail please myfriends give me enough crap for that one as it is \) there 's something cathartic about a nearly indestructable creature that operates on pure id who does n't want to just lose it when we get pushed too far \? this game has many things going for it it controls very well nearly every object in the vast and varied environments is destructable in some way shape or form and the graphics are certainly servicable \( although not top notch \) the best way to describe this is to take an open gamespace like the grand theft auto games minus the infuriatingly difficult missions and add a set of missions that beg you to destroy everything every mission is based in some way on the premise of you as a giant green demolition expert now this may sound like it would wear thin quickly but the game does remain fresh do in large part to a huge selection of upgraded moves that you can 'buy' with smashpoints which are awarded via smashing things \( deep huh \? \) it is really a massive orgy of soothing mayhem and mercy is it ever satisfying ! if you tried out the first hulk game please be aware that this is nothing like that there are no more tedious sneaking missions as bruce banner you are the hulk and the jade giant is an absolute gas in this title like the gta games you are not forced into playing missions \( although this does unlock new moves and arenas to play in \) you can take on side quests which are not only pretty creative but downright hilarious in others \( try 'batter up ! ' for an example of the latter \) if the first hulk game and ang lee 's movie left a sour taste in your mouth when it comes to mr green genes then give this one a shot in my opinion they got the essence of the hulk down pat and show him for the fun character that he can be later !	7

1	i purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser \( selling at football games \) it came out to about 06 cents per piece what several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace \( there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that \) the combined price of 18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at oriental trading \( 1 00 each \) and you ca n't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace would recommend these for kids birthday parties fundraiser church parties etc	7

0	i can see from reading the below reviews that i'm not the only one who hates this thing what a total waste ! i got it for my little one remembering how much i \( and every other kid i 've ever known \) loved this toy well this version has been made too safe to have any fun on it barely spins if you want your toddler to develop amazing upper body strength then force them to work out on this thing a couple times a day it 's almost impossible to spin and you never get up any momentum at all not to mention the loud loud music with no volume control which i could deal with if the thing was any fun at all	7

0	we travel in third world countries and ordered this to provide a little more security while we 're sleeping the materials used in this lock are just too flimsy to inspire much confidence the main body is plastic the metal bar which fits into the door jamb is thin and flexible so easily bends out of the way when pressure is put on the door the serrations on the bar are not deep so do n't promise much strength while none of these locks can be expected to withstand someone trying to kick the door in this one while prettily designed is overly expensive and unimpressive we 're going to try a few others by the way in returning this item which we consider unsatisfactory amazon will charge us doubly the cost to return the item to amazon and also charge us for what we originally saved with our super saver shipping the end result is far from the full refund other merchants offer	7
0	yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it 's pretty bad how possession ever became a hit i 've not idea well where i come from it did n't but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck besides he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash pity listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man rockin' horse for example an interesting additin to the aor landscape and some of the music is lively but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't get my vote even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track \( we all know which one \) but hey if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse	7
0	i purchased this item based on the picture i did n't want a cheap looking air hockey table because i planned to keep it for a long time the price seemed good for the looks of the table even though the shipping was 150 arranging delivery with the carrier was a bit awkward but not too bad but the box itself was clearly abused and showed a general lack of care in handling i do n't know if the abuse was from the carrier delivering it to me or prior carrier but it did have me worried about the condition of the contents i could n't see any parts through the holes and tears in the box so i hoped for the best when i opened the box there was no obvious shipping damage however there was one spot on the surface that could have been caused by improper packaging the assembly instructions were a poor quality photocopy that cut the top line off most pages there was a separate sheet of paper instructing me to line up letter tags during assembly however the tags were not properly placed and assembly per the diagram on the sheet would have been impossible assuming all parts were symmetrical worked just as well i was also disappointed with the quality of the assembly of the main components alignment was poor making final assembly difficult and there was excessive adhesive all over the place even on the playing surface i was able to remove most of the adhesive from the playing surface except for one spot that may have been damage from shipping the table comes with a 90 warranty on materials and workmanship but does n't include shipping as the table surface is the largest component i'm imagining it would cost most of the 150 shipping fee to have it replaced at this point i'm not willing to sink any more money into this table after the table was set up i was hoping it would at least play well i was disappointed there too there are some plastic guards on the goals that make scoring very difficult i 've never seen anything like them on other tables by the time you get the puck moving fast enough to evade your opponents blocking of the small opening your shooting for it fly 's off the table in fact you spend more time retrieving the puck than you do playing maybe this has something to do with the extra adhesive down the sides of the playing surface but it still ruins the game there were a lot of excited kids when the table arrived they all played about one game and now the table sits unused all in all this has been my most disappointing online purchase i guess there are some things you see first hand before you buy	7
1	when i bought these i was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my mp3 player in my pocket not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound i did n't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product the cord also has a built in volume control so i do n't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume the buds are quite comfortable i have worn them for hours at a time with no problem i love these	7

0	first let me say i love koyaanisqatsi the original film in this trilogy koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth the second film in the trilogy powaqqatsi was n't as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war instead it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation nothing more if not for philip glass' music i would not have given this film any rating at all i write this criticism in hopes that godfrey reggio sees it he should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us as clearly as he did with koy why war \( the topic of naq \) is so horrific if you want an effective critique of violence try clockwork orange naqoyqatsi is simply a mess	7

1	if you 've found these reviews you already know this lens is one of the best canon products out there i did not bite on the is version and i have not found myself ever wishing i did this lens is everything it 's hyped up to be and performs well in low light indoor situations i do n't think it 's weight is that big a deal i really do n't have any problem carrying this lens around for a day in my hands or in a bag even with a 1 4 extender attached it can feel a bit heavy but i do n't mind and neither will you when you see the results later on i 've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it 's landed me front page ink several times in my mind i could get the 1 4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70 280 range which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography considering the 300 f 2 8 and it 's friends are much much more expensive the lens works basically just as fast and sharp in my opinion with the 1 4 at f 4 although some may debate this flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro if you can swing the price enjoy it ! my advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products although i found most everyone agreed this is one of the finest lens around it 's one that makes people stop and stare and wonder who you are	7

1	the hucksters does an excellent job of portraying the cut throat business that advertising is clark gable playing the suave but ethical advertising man is the protagonist and he is pitted against the larger than life business tycoon sydney greenstreet both are pitted against one another in this real life chess match each making strategic moves of cunning self pride and power gable in an attempt at making the advertising business a respectable one and greenstreet by instilling fear into the bumbling idiots who surround him greenstreet operates as though his customers are mindless sheep easily persuaded by fancy packaging and jingles of no substance whereas gable is convinced that the customer is intelligent and is looking for more than bells and whistles when purchasing a product most interesting however is the internal struggle gable kerr and gardner are each battling gable basically a good man is somewhat of a player and finds himself in love with kerr kerr a widow with children is a righteous woman deeply attracted to gable but cannot reconcile with his lifestyle gardner a sultry singer of a sordid background longs to settle down as a respectable housewife and mother and his her net set for gable all three do a magnificent job of portraying the internal struggles of their characters in the end gable buckles but does not break before the formidable greenstreet realizing that he cannot continue on working for this tyrant without compromising his standards gable passes on the company \? s lucrative offer and walks but not before he has publicly humiliated greenstreet of course gable does get the girl in the end which one \? watch the movie and find out !	7

1	this watch looks and feels great on me yes i had to take out about 6 links to get a good fit but that was fairly easy and only took 5 minutes \( which included figuring out how to do it which i 'll explain at the end \) the clasp locks well firm but not difficult to lock unlock and is very secure i was a little suprised with how lightweight the links band is that 's the only part of the watch that feels a little cheap do n't get me wrong it 's well constructed but it 's not like a big manly steel band at the end of the day i found that i loved it because it isn't heavy i did n't give it a full 5 stars because after having it a few weeks there 's a teeny tiny scratch that developed on the face crystal i'm really cautious and have been gentle with it so i'm rather disappointed this happened \( and it very possibly might have been me knocking up against a brick wall or something \) if you 're especially rough on your things this might not be the best watch for you taking the links out is easy if you 're not completely inept you 'll want something small and sort of pointy \( i happened to have had a filed down mini screwdriver but a nail would probably work just as well \) i found it easiest to first disconnect the standard clasp just push the pin in \( on either side \) and wiggle the clasp apart make sure you do n't drop lose the pin for the links it 's fool proof it has an arrow engraved on the back of the links showing you which side the pin insert comes out stick the nail whatever into the small oval hole and pry the pin out the side pull it out with a pair of pliers \( it 's in there pretty tight \) and you can then remove the link	8

0	i have had to set up a few new installs of the vista business on some servers and i was disappointed with the overall performance my biggest gripe is when i tried to remotely log in from another pc and i sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click 'yes' to allow the process to run how irritating ! kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in does n't it \? also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the remote connections authorization so when i thought i was remotely logging in under the new admin account name vista would n't let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity some hidden place it took me 15 minutes to find i discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when i did the name change yikes ! for those who need to run vnc server on vista be aware there are issues installing and running that you will need to work around as well it seems like microsft drastically changed the menus overdid the default security features and installed a new hood ornament other than that i do n't see what the big deal is	8

1	compared to the first humidifier i got from walmart this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect oh well i just got it yesterday so it 's too early to say perfect but considering others' reviews i am pretty confident that i am gonna love it longer than at the first sight the only thing is i do n't know where to put it the power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long i am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time	8

1	when i got my hands on the pmc 120 i thought this was going to to be the best player but when i started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way i agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation device feel to it music when i tried to put music in my pmc it syncronized my mp3s with the wmp 10 with no problem \( very fast \) if u are looking for a grab and drop \( copy paste \) your music mp3 device this is not for you because when i did it got everything in one same folder that read unknown artist and album so you have to put all your mp3s via wmp 10 wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast the problems that i encountered is that it only has one portable playlist and sometimes when im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button one cool thing is that it shows the cd covers without having to put them in this is done via the wmp10 the sound is very good and crisp and the equalizer setups are fair but you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound pictures this is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders you can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a pc to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you video ok now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me i wanted a portable media device that i would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid i knew that this device only reads wmv but it supports divx xvid mpeg etc this support deppends on what the wmp10 can play so this means that you sincronyze \( via wmp10 \) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into wmp movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your pmc secreen size i had this in mind when i bought it and was fine with me untill i tried it the first time the wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that i had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the wmp10 so after uninstalling and installing i was good to go so i converted a 1 45hr long movie in only 25 minutes but this short moment of joy was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the wmp10 fits the widescreen movies into the pmc and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable ! ! ! ! you cant change this because the wmp does this automatically my answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into wmv files the problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert i have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the wmp10 in the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the wmp10 and it does it very fast and with good quality you can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so i think this option is useless on the pmc so the veredict is the pmc 120 is a good multimedia player with minor glitches it is a little bulky but personally i think the size is not that big i think the good side of the size issue comes along with its big 3 6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video if you want to play directly your divx or xvid movies on your player buy another porduct like the iriver pmp series or the archos players wich are way way way more expensive so i think that for the price and for what it does the pmc 120 gets two thumbs up	8

1	i used paint shop pro to help build my website i really like it and i'm glad i bought it my favorite part about it is the animation software you can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects because of psp 9 my website now has animation buttons and a banner with bright colors and images ! i love it ! and anyone can use it ! i had no experience with psp or computer art and graphics but this is pretty simple to use also you can use psp for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs this is great software for doing all this stuff and it 's so much cheaper than photoshop if you 're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work then maybe you want to check out paint shop pro	8

1	i have been a regular subscriber of sci fi mags for just about the past 15 yrs or so it all began with omni and when omni folded i found a a copy of science fiction age i had been subscribed to it for about 2 years before it folded i found a few omni like glossy mag twins thereafter but they all folded as well finally i found the magazine of fantasy and science fiction and analog and have been consistently subscribed to other for the past 10 yrs both of the latter are outstanding 'zines but for me analog is the best because it satisfies the craving for hard sci fi and fact at the same time if f sf analog ever have to close up shop then i would hope they would merge because then i 'd have my hard sci fi fact and horror fantasy all in a one stop shop	8

0	lcd fell off when arrived because the two side sticker was n't stong enough anyhow i could push it back then the scale could n't be turned on by tapping on the top this is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual i have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime ! i think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken this is the problem i ca n't fix the only thing i can do is sending it back following up according to the other review i tried to make this scale vibrating using different ways of tapping it did n't work no matter how hard i tried i had to use my toe to lift up one side a little \( about half an inch \) and drop it on hard floor to make enough vibration to turn it on i wonder how long this scale can function well by such a way to switch on my soehnle scale always turns on by a soft tapping i have to admit the reading of this scale is very clear and accurate just feel a little nervous standing on two pieces of glass and also be careful to use it in bathroom moisture will make the glass surface slippery	8
1	this multimeter is an all around good tool it has all the features you need plus some of the features that only the more expensive ones have like the battery tester and backlight display i am studying electronics right now and i find myself getting a ton more use out of it than i thought i would it is easy to use and the instruction manual that comes with it tells you how to perform most common tests that it does with pictures to go along there are comperable multi meters out there that cost less but most would cost more there are certainly better multi meters than this one but they will cost more the only bad things i can say about this tool is that the battery is hard to get to you have to remove 2 screws in the back and pry it apart actron should have just put one of those slide off battery covers on it also most multi meters come with some sort of rubber protective sleeve that also has a lanyard for your hand so you dont drop it if this mult meter had a lanyard and the battery was easier to get out i would have given it a 5 stars	8
1	the truth about cats and dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable refreshing movie janeane garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical depressed miserable pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want of course she 's not really acting that 's really her lock stock and barrel the miserable pessimistic vicious act is n't an act at all the fly in the ointment to this movie is that uma thurman is not a knockout of course some men would prefer the tall thin blonde over the short brunette but the basis of the movie hinges on uma being the gorgeous woman and janeane being average but it does n't work when you believe it 's the other way around uma thurman has certainly looked good in some movies but she looks haggard here bottom line a good film about the ugly duckling getting the guy based on the classic cyrano de bergerac story just like roxanne starring steve martin	8

1	in this fully illustrated and remarkably brief book hawking provides an overview of the state of theoretical physics at the dawn of the 21st century the often dense text is supplemented by biographical details witty asides and \( especially \) luxuriously reproduced introductions hawking covers a lot of territory in 200 pages he hopes to provide brief non intimidating summaries of recent concepts and new frontiers in science there is astonishingly little text and at times the pithiness compactness and occasional cuteness may work against readers' understanding there 's perhaps too much shell and not enough nut here some sections are so cursory that i suspect they will fail to make any sense at all to the untutored reader \( this is especially true of several of the passages on imaginary time event horizons and brane world models \) the text is aided greatly however by the beautifully rendered four color illustrations even if the concepts presented by these drawings seem fuzzy at first the creativity and humor fused into moonrunner design 's artwork will attract engage and occasionally tease readers who might otherwise be frightened by the sight of a quadratic equation overall then the book might have far more value as a refresher course for the beginner rather than as an introduction for the uninitiated yet it 's certainly conceivable that somebody new to this material might be intrigued enough to explore these subjects further if you 're looking for a book that will flesh out the concepts presented here i strongly recommend \( as does hawking \) alan guth 's the inflationary universe or brian greene 's the elegant universe	8

1	as a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises it 's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears having first been written in 1856 but it is practical clear and encouraging it dispells the idea that only certain people can draw and by focussing on drawing with pencil it provides the foundation for using any other media a wonderful find	8

0	this is not the first interview that fra junge has given view the sensational 1974 documentary the world at war ' narrated by lord laurence olivier and you will see a much younger junge musing over her tenure with hitler most of the information that she provides in this documentary was given in the world at war the 1974 documentary is filled with footage of hitler having had relatives who were in germany at the time and personally knowing former german soldiers and officers i find it difficult to believe that junge did not know of the nazi death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on i believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by hitler perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors my mother personally met hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace at any rate blind spot repeats the world at war interviews and is a talking head that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice over the three stars is for effort minus one star for nothing new and minus another star for german and not english \( english sub titles \) the younger frau spoke good english in 1974 but is lost in blind spot s	8

1	as of 2007 most of the bugs mentioned in the other reviews are fixed the ipod fits snug as a bug in my unit and it even charges it youu can even find this as low as 140 or chaper im not sure why the bad reviews this is a wonderful dvd player and the newer one i got even plays your ipod through your tv if you want older versions did not allow this you should buy this the video quality isnt great but good thats why i gave it four stars instead of five it is bulky but you need room for the ipod to plug in the only bad side is no ipod naviation from the menu you must use the ipod itself but being able to play your ipod and dvd through any tv with rca jacks \( audio video \) is great i can now backup my purchased ipod items to dvd since i have an eyetv250 which allows you to use your computer as a tv the eyetv has rca jacks on the device which allows me to record it to my harddrive which i then use toast to burn my dvd all in all its completely worth it even as a stand alone dvd player it 's great never had the first proble	8

0	after viewing the avengers with emma peel which i do every evening after the dreadful news enjoying repeats and repeats as well with reluctance i played the hospital dvd i thought it was terrible the diagogue idiotic i could not help but laugh when scott attacked diana emma peel would have thrown him across the room i had to play a few episodes of emma peel in the avengers series to cleanse me of this disappointing and terrible hospital dvd the lovely diana rigg is a great actress and an extremely intelligent woman and i was saddened that diana after all those wonderful and exciting avengers collection with her unrivaled beauty and possessing the most beautiful voice and able to do her own stunts took on this dismal role in the hospital dvd i see that this dvd was dated 1971 this was only 4 years after her last avenger episodes dated 1967 in hospital i believe she was 33 years old oh well i will cleanse myself of this hospital dvd and devote an eveningr to a few episodes of the avengers with the lovely diana rigg as emma peel finall john steed would have been shocked to see how emma reacted to george scott the doctor can you imagdine if john steed appeared in the hospital dvd to collect diana rigg and ride off into the sunset as they do after an avenger episode perhaps they will issue hospital 11 and bringr in john steed and a few other great actors of that series robert lyonsreno nevad	8

1	i 've been using spiegelau wine glasses for several years and they are excellent the bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine these glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine \( they 're also not bad for rhones though i prefer the reidel vinum syrah glass \) if you drink a lot of burgundy or pinot noir or italian piedmont wines \( barolo barbaresco langhe \) i 'd suggest spiegelau 's burgundy glass if your preference is zinfandel or chianti you 're a bit out of luck with spiegelau however their chianti glass is n't very good try the riedel vinum chianti glass for these wines you 'll be knocked out by the way it focuses the bouquet some reviewers have complained about breakage i 've seldom broken a glass but it does occasionally happen during washing my method is to clear the sink run the water as hot as possible put a bit of dishsoap in each glass i then use a special ultra soft brush \( which i got at a local wine shop for about 6 \) to clean the glass removing fingerprints and especially the gunk around the rim then rinse thoroughly with very hot water invert on cloth after about half an hour with the glasses almost dry you can wipe them off with paper towels \( which do n't leave any lint behind \) and put them away the main thing is never to lay them down in the sink and wash one glass at a time just do the wine glasses and pay attention to what you 're doing do n't try to stick your hand inside the bowl when drying just use the paper towels finally even though these glasses are supposed to be dishwasher safe i do n't know why anybody who loves wine would put stemware in a dishwasher dishwashers always leave a film and eventually their abrasive detergents will put microscopic scratches on the glasses which lose their clarity as a consequence	8

0	this grill pan heats relatively evenly and is large enough to accomodate four slices of bread allowing for the preparation of two sandwiches simultaneously it leaves nice grill marks on the food and works well overall the press that comes with it is very nice to have as it helps cook food faster however it has one major drawback it makes a very odd smell when it is used regardless of the temperature at which it is being heated i thought maybe this smell would dissappear after several uses but even after many uses the smell is still as strong as the day i took it out of the box it is enough of an odor to make me wonder about the safety of the product i have a number of higher end calphalon non stick pans and none of them make this smell making me think this is a consequence of a cheaper pan bottom line if i had to do it over again i would spend a bit more money and get a higher end calphalon grill pan and press instead	8

1	katie holmes plays april a young woman whose family has despaired of her she has invited them for thanksgiving dinner and it 's particularly important because her mother \( patricia clarkson \) has cancer and is not expected to live katie is living in nyc with her boyfriend in the kind of grafitti covered apartment building filled with an odd assortment of tenants that is only to be found in ny in other words it will terrify her non urban family the film begins as katie wakes up she 's never cooked a big dinner like this before and has a reputation for failure with her family in fact her family puts her down so much that you quickly feel sorry for her no one could be that bad and is n't your family supposed to have an unnaturally high opinion of you and not the other way around \? patricia clarkson was amazing in this film she is batty but at times her battiness is just simply playing with her family \( there 's a method in her madness \) my only criticism would be that the whole subplot about what katie 's boyfriend is off doing while she 's trying to cook the turkey well that subplot just did n't work for me otherwise this was a memorable film worth watching more than once	8

1	early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the new republic as you explore their base with no force powers but events make a turn for the worse and you go to luke and request for your lightsaber back then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark jedi killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game with amazing graphics and increddible duels this game is simply magnificent plus the multiplayer is awesome \( especially when you play ctf and give the other team a boat load of storm troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so stormtroopers makes the game a game you 'll never want to trade in ! plus the duels are fun to play again and again i would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult all in all a great game that any starwars fan must own any shooter fan really has to have and if you like both oooh you need it really bad	8

1	quot the great director quot volume 2 in the quot unknown chaplin quot series from thames television looks at chaplin working on some of his biggest films including quot the kid quot quot the gold rush quot and my personal favorite quot city lights quot the chief assets of this documentary are the treasures found in the chaplin family private film vault including discarded sequences and home movies never before seen by the public there are also interviews with jackie coogan lita grey virginia cherrill and others who worked with chaplin the emphasis remains on how chaplin worked beginning with simple sight gags and slapstick and transforming them into comic masterpieces this volume also gets into a bit more of chaplin 's artistic temperament especially when his patience ran thin with cherrill and he temporarily replaced her with grey as the blind girl in quot city lights quot there are even clips of the film 's classic ending shot with grey kevin brownlow and david gill were given access to these unseen films by oona chaplin and they make the most of it in providing a portrait of a great artist at work james mason provides the narration managing to sound like a college professor lecturing students and at the same time like a fan of chaplin 's comic genius whether you have seen a few or all of chaplin 's films quot unknown chaplin quot is an absolute treat	8

1	when i first got my phone i was quite excited it had more memory than my current treo 650 however only after one day i noticed the battery life was draining much faster than i had anticipated from my research i discovered a few things that needed to be done before i extend my battery life to more than 10 hours 1 \) i had to apply a camera patch since my phone was manufactured prior to jan 18th this patch can be found on palm support site 2 \) i needed to completely drain my battery until there was nothing then charge it for 24 hours once i did these two things my phone has lasted for a few days without a charge and i 've set my versamail to retrieve messages when they arrive this is a big plus for me going from getting emails every hour to getting them when they arrive i 've had no problems with any of my sd cards or mini sd cards the increase internal memory also helps since i use my tomtom navigation with my treo i 've heard the various complaints but you have to work through some of them it is a great phone	8

0	this picture is a mess of misused metaphors and confused imagery from start to finish i was left scratching my head wondering who these people are and why they behave the way they do forgive me for expecting the film to provide any answers first the good news if you like beautiful boys ricardo meneses as the twisted sergio is one of the most gorgeous creatures to ever stand naked before a lens despite the hopelessly confusing script his acting \( such as it is \) is amazing especially if you take into account his age \( 18 \) and experience \( his first film \) it 's too bad he had to be discovered by a director who thinks nothing of making his audience beg for each scrap of insight and pretentiously expects the viewer to read their own interpretation into whatever nonsense he sees fit to set up as his next scene i wanted to give it the benefit of a doubt so after sitting through one screening of this erotically charged but confused tangle of a movie i sat through it again this time with the directors commentary on cheating i know but after shelling out all that money for the dvd i was hoping to gain some idea of what the hell was going on i emerged from watching it the second time half in love with the beautiful young actor ricardo meneses but with only a fraction of the respect i had for the director joao pedro rodrigues after my first screening and that was n't much sergio is a garbage collector for the city of lisbon he works a graveyard shift with an assortment of other oddballs and in between collecting garbage he has a series of sexual escapades that seem impossibly jaded for one so young while other boys his age are swimming or surfing he 's dressing up in a full body suit of latex having anonymous sex in men 's rooms \( including the most explicit act of fellatio i have ever seen in a non pornographic movie \) and exploring s m adventures with any willing male he can find just so you know how kinky he is in one scene he masturbates in the shower while strangling himself with the shower massage cord you really have to wonder where all this imagination comes from until you realize that the writer director has been harboring some pretty extreme sexual fantasies about his friendly neighborhood garbage men sergio has a female co worker who is in love with him but she 's busy having sex with the foreman and sergio 's only interest in her is to tease her sexually and then play cruel jokes on her he finally meets a man who does n't succumb to his charms because he 's obviously straight this was not the first or last thing in this film i did n't get when i was that age and almost as pretty as sergio i understood that some guys just could n't be had so i shrugged my shoulders and moved on not our sergio he takes obsession to unheard of heights especially for an 18 year old he stalks the young swimmer goes through his garbage and steals his torn old swimsuit of course unrequited sexual obsession in films is not exactly new remember reflections in a golden eye \? in that film made in 1967 and still considered by many critics to be one of the ten worst bombs ever made the male object of marlon brando 's desire was almost as pretty as ricardo meneses but that film had the advantage of a script that was at least coherent at times in one of the first of many explicit sexual encounters in o fantasma sergio while walking his dog comes upon a policeman handcuffed and gagged in the backseat of a patrol car he proceeds to masturbate the cop to orgasm leaving him tied up in the car and then running off to work where he spends the rest of the night sniffing his hand and licking the residue i was hoping that the director 's commentary would maybe explain how and why the cop is tied up in his own squad car but his sole comment on the soundtrack is you do n't understand in the film why the cop is handcuffed excuse me mr rodrigues but i did n't understand it in the audience either sergio 's only tender scenes are when he takes care of the dog a mascot of the sanitation workers in one scene sergio is busy cleaning the dog dishes and doghouse with a hose when he turns and sees the foreman standing in the door he pushes past their faces register some indications of conflict and then the foreman shuts the door the director 's commentary on this action is the door closes and you know what will happen but you do n't see it uh no i'm afraid the relationship between sergio and foreman is the least developed of all the underdeveloped relationships in this film so what will happen next is anybody 's guess not that i really cared sergio is the only character in the script whose personality is even partially explored and all we ever really learn about him is that he 's sexually compulsive and kinky to the max the picture goes on endlessly with sergio refusing to let go of his obsession for the young surfer swimmer until he has the most excruciatingly slow breakdown ever recorded in a movie at the same time what little there is of coherence also breaks down the director 's commentary infuriated me even more when toward the end after spending most of the commentary praising the cooperation beauty talent and maturity of his young lead actor he proclaims it is cruel to say it but he wants to continue acting and i think he will not act again i will not use him in my next film it 's like his body has been used up i have n't had the benefit of seeing anything else by mr rodrigues but if given the choice of viewing mr rodrigues' next film or ricardo meneses next appearance i think i 'd opt for the beautiful boy any day after botching the attempted kidnapping of his beloved obsession sergio takes off to spend the balance of the film wordlessly running the final scenes treat us to a guided tour of the sights sounds \( and by way of commentary \) smells of a garbage dump as sergio wanders through the dump clutching a live rabbit he finds among the garbage \( i saw the rabbits there says the director on the commentary so it 's believable \) the director grasping for a final metaphor remarks he is like a cross between a bug and an insect a comment that seems to me to be a cross between the idiotic and the insipid he then ends this drivel after the slowest twenty minutes of film i 've ever sat through by more or less telling us he did n't really know how to end it like i had n't figured that out a full ten minutes before the end credits started running as sergio continues to stumble on into the dawn before the final fadeout the director says i could bring him back to the city but that would not make much sense the idea of a scene that might not make much sense did n't prevent him from filming the other 90 minutes of this drek i dare say he should have gone for it	8

0	it may say slow cooker on the front of the item but i assure you it is anything but slow ! i was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me ! so i made my hungarian ghoulash in it glad that the night meal would be done in 8 10 hours when we got back from the beach all i can say is thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later or we would n't have had anything but charcoal left had we left the campsite that day without checking it ! it was cooking on low and it was literally done in a half hour 's time so keep in mind if you are camping and you have n't tried using this product yet it wo n't take long before your meal is done sadly my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip the campground we were at did n't have electricity hence why i wanted a propane crock pot	8

1	i found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research amp of tracking earnings estimates mitch zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform the zacks rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years it seems as if the zacks rank really is accurate and more imporartantly a successful investing method this is the first book i have read that has actually helped me make money rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads overall good book i would definitely recommend it	8

1	as a subscriber to martha stewarts magazines i have to admit this has become my favorite simply because its concise and interesting to boot love the week end dinner section as well as the recipe index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when i am looking for something quick to consider fixing but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine some of the other regular features that i like and find helpful are the cooking for one section since as a widow i hate wasting food and know of many other singles who want to eat healthy but need some ideas also like the wine basics section which has enlightened me on new wines that i now like trying in season is a great section because it reminds the reader what is in season which makes shopping and cooking easier the size of the magazine is nice because it slips easily into my pocket so i can recheck it while shopping to see what items i have highlighted to pick up this is also a great magazine for couples singles of all ages which is refreshing since so many magazines are geared to upper middle class 2 5 children homes and the magazine seems to improve with each new issue	8

0	i loved the first xenosaga then this arrived episode 2 ise n't a bad game in terms of the story the intro is absolutely dynamite then you get into a battle now if you like tactical stuff this is a good game for you but if you 're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing i say save your money gone is the amazingly well done battle system in the first episode in its place stands a completely out of nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies \( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 hps \) ridiculous but that 's not all the enemies have weak zones that depend of the height of the attack that you input the zones are a b and c a being the highest triangle c square b and circle a sometimes see what i mean \? it 's completely screwed up and you have to become deeplyaddicted to the game to understand its full potential and if that was n't enough they changed the voice actors too kos mos 'svoice sounds more like an operator than a robot 's and momo sounds like a brat at least chaos' voice has improved i 'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this i just hope namco comes out with a better sequel otherwise spend your moey on something else \( like shadow hearts for example \)	8

0	before you buy be sure to check where the pen was made i have a number of older cross pens that say usa near the top and they are great pens however i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made and they are of inferior quality the top and bottom halves are loose and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap the first one i got i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their lifetime guarantee only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine and a handling fee attached i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly one bad pen so later on when some new colors came out i bought two more only to see that they have the same quality defect my advice if you want a good cross pen go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa they are n't making them the same anymore	8
1	used an infantino front carrier for several hours a day until my back started to hurt purchased the ultimate baby wrap based on the reviews here i liked the idea of even weight distribution and being able to put baby in different positions while using the wrap is n't intuitive \( ie watch the dvd \) it 's easy to learn my back problems are gone and baby is more snug in the wrap \( tummy to tummy \) than in traditional front carriers i wanted to use the sling position but baby is too big length and width wise only gripe is that there is no neck support in the tummy to tummy position so i have to hold baby 's head while i rock her to sleep would recommend this product great price too	8

0	what could have been a hilarious informative account of breaking outlandish old fashioned laws and getting \( or not getting \) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young british guys \( i think the author is around 23 \) wryly making fun of america 's perceived backwardness sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and when they could n't they outright gave up on some great chances the swedish girls in frisco why include it if it did n't come to fruition and furthermore involved no lawbreaking \? \? \? i'm still wondering why they included their 2 page tour of hearst castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log \( cool hearst had greco roman statues in his poolroom \) they do n't get arrested and they do n't really accomplish anything too bad	8

0	okay this is not a review of the product itself but i stronglyencourage you to consider not getting an n e w warranty they arereally not in the business to fix things but to make money not fixing things if you had anything to do with the device not working \( e g you dropped it forget about it they aint gonna fix replace it whatever \) they have a very sparce network of repair companies so if there is no one who can fix it in your area you have to ship it to them in virginia \( of course you have to pay for the shipping ! \) lastly they tend to screw over their repair companies so in some cases they will refuse to repair items covered under an n e w warranty or they will take forever to repair it since they know n e w will take months to pay them for the work they did if you want a nightmare for a warranty then by all means go for it	8

1	koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s the career and tactics of this admiral are still studied at the u s naval academy and doubtless those of other nations the screenplay is based on a couple of novels so there is some fiction but the life of yi soon shin was well documented so there 's plenty of fact supporting the story if you are not familiar with korean drama it 's good to keep in mind that this is not a hollywood product but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non hollywood budgets involved and it 's easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told it 's a long series but presents an epic with power depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode it would be great also to see kbs make other dramas available for viewing through amazon such as seoul 1945	8

0	there is a pattern in hollywood when it comes to drama revenge films such as eye for an eye it is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised they are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end whilst the victim or top billed actor actress comes out as the hero at the end it is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort but for this critic it is getting old eye for an eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film from the opening credits of this film you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end the pauses could be guessed the lines could have been written the night before and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best it was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic the violins would always shrill around kiefer and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere this is your typical revenge film with no excitement no frills nothing that would make it stand out from the rest the late director john schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end where did eye for an eye go wrong \? i do n't think i need to count all the ways for you but some of the bigger issues that i had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters i have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic what was sally field 's job \? i know that is a small detail but it better highlights my complaint that our central family \( the mccanns \) were not as developed as i would have liked to have seen i had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed ed harris literally walked through his character proving that field 's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion the only character worth watching and was developed briefly was kiefer he was 100 evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end yet we did n't even know that much about him either \( which upset me \) schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with eye for an eye very well the actors i believe even knew the story and they probably did n't even need to read the script and the story played it safe from the beginning but it was n't what i wanted to see i expected film like this to come out during the 80s not in 1996 it was pathetic to see name actors like ed harris sally field phillip baker hall keith david and kiefer sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan nothing stood out in this film nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it and nothing made me feel excited about these actors this was a literal nothing film it lent nothing to the cinematic world except \( and i stress this a bit \) another peg in a very tired genre known as the revenge thriller after watching this film i said to my wife that i thought sally field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements which made me think of a high school drama production it was amateur at best but she said that is why directors use sally because she is known for being overly dramatic this is a pure example of a good thing gone badly sally saw success with it once but as she continues it only creates bad cinema there were times during sally 's bigger speeches that i found myself laughing i could n't help myself but her focus on certain words and clich reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike the same could be said for ed harris who obviously has discovered that he does n't have to play the outlaying father any further in films he was completely wasted in this film was there any emotion with him \? i did n't see any then there was the pitiful contribution by hall and david that begin with intrigue but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes also did mantegna take a class on how to be a one dimensional clich \? urg his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one dimensional police officers again the only actor worth watching was kiefer because he not only spoke with evil but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile it was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end if i have to talk about the story i think i am just going to go mad myself field over dramatized the entire film thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer did kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because field wanted to see him as evil \? that could have been a great avenue for this film to travel but alas ole safe schlesinger did n't take us down that darker path i needed more to develop what hall and david were doing at the support groups but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers this was yet another dark avenue that was not explored i felt as if i saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast yet we chose to stay on the lighted path that coupled with the poor acting just created a film that did n't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world overall in case it was n't obvious this was n't a good movie at all in fact i could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again i thought only horror movies had the stated scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again but with eye for an eye it became obvious that it the revenge thrill fell into that same pattern the only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure this film did not sally field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight while everyone else was forgettable the only fun part was watching jack bauer play the epitome of evil watch this film for kiefer but nothing else skip it ! grade out of	8

1	flesh and bone is an evocative haunting and rewarding study of a drifting man \( played with understated heartbreaking perfection by dennis quaid \) who encounters a lost soul \( meg ryan outstanding \) leaving a violent marriage and begins a tender relationship until a dark figure from his past shows up plotted an as slow burning thriller this is really more of a complex and intriguing character study of guilt father son ties violent crime and doomed love flesh and bone is a bleak but supremely well crafted film that reaches a truly sad \( though inevitable \) conclusion the final moment between our two main characters is incredibly moving \( in a very unsentimental sort of way \) and a scene that i will never forget i didnt mind the major plot twist as its no more unbelievable that a dozen of hollywood 's most praised suspense thrillers the spare atmospheric photography \( set in a desolate bleak texas \) is exceptional and thomas newman 's suberb score will get under your skin for those who wont something altogether deeper affecting and more emotionally satisfying with their thrillers \( or love stories \) flesh and bone should be ripe for rediscovery	8

1	nobody and i mean nobody could be more of an illustrator novice ignoramus than i several months ago i was given a licensed copy of illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would 've gone to an agency i raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty having taught myself everything from ms dos to turbocad to photoshop elements not to mention word excel and powerpoint \( do n't get me started on that latter program argh \) i figured i could tackle at least the basics of illustrator 9 loaded it on my laptop took it home for a weekend and just about lost my sanity and several fingernails trying to learn that confounding program i managed to produce a few logos one of which was chosen but egads what a big stinky bear illustrator 9 was to wrestle when i saw that cs2 had this live trace feature i pleaded with my workplace santa to get it for me and wow ! what an overall improvement ! ! illustrator will still not be as intuitive to pick up as an ms office product but this comes darn close with cs2 they 've given us hot tips little clues about what some of the tools do that pop up when you mouse over the tool the intuitive menus are nice too also cool is that all the text paragraph and fill stroke features which used to be huge boxes taking up valuable real estate on the screen are now condensed up on a small horizontal toolbar like in the office products and when you mouse over them the screen tips tell you how to expand them aaaahh ! finally some help for dunces like me live trace and live paint are unbelieveably cool the very first thing i did after loading cs2 was to grab a jpg photo of a soccer ball off google images and within 20 minutes without consulting any book or online help i 'd converted it into a simple graphic image painted into the 2 colors i wanted but as for a great guidebook the reviewer who suggested illustrator visual quickstart guide by elaine weinmann was dead on i 've bought several other highly rated books to try to help me through the confounding quagmire of adobe products so i 've seen them all the visual quickstart book does n't have any of that insufferable wanna be a comic novel author writing and focuses just on the basics and it 's very literal with step by step instructions still there 's no substitute for the utterly excruciating process of learning illustrator through experience but the weinmann book 's better than any i 've seen yet the only reason i have n't given this product a 5 is because it still does n't have the intuitiveness that it needs in that way it 's still snobby aimed at pros not folks like me who need to do occasional design stuff but not for a living but this is a far far far cry better than illustrator 9 absolutely worth the money just for live trace and live paint alone	8

1	this album is by far on the greatest recent live recordings sheryl crow demonstrates her influence and talent by putting on an all star show with some of the biggest names in music history sheryl shines on her own singing some of her great hits but it 's the duets that really make the album my least favorite has to be the dixie chicks just because i ca n't appreciate the country flare they bring to strong enough but it 's still a great version chrissie hynde one of the album 's highlights brings intense attitude to if it makes you happy still one of my favorite sheryl songs stevie nicks remains stevie nicks giving more than enough emotion and flare to her own gold dust woman sarah mclachlan 's usually soft voice comes out strong on the difficult kind and compliments sheryl 's quite nicely my favorite rendition has to be eric clapton and sheryl together on cream 's white room the rock out moment on the album the show is complete when all the guests return to belt out bob dylan 's tombstone blues and close the show with a definite bang	8

1	unlike the december 2006 review and much like the most recent reviews there 's not much in this soup other than very small bits of seafood and some potato i'm thinking that 1 \) the recent quality has gone downhill or 2 \) the december 2006 review was a plant anyway the taste was okay but it definitely does n't rate up there with legal seafood \( which i 've had at one of the restaurants and at the boston airport both much better than this \)	8

0	so i bought this a couple months ago at first i was in love great sound quality and the surround sound aspect works well in fps games also very comfortable much more so than any other 5 1 headphones i have owned the initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly though first of all the microphone sucks i 've seen better microphones on 20 radio shack headphones these are gaming headphones and expensive ones at that you would think the microphone would be at least passable it is n't secondly the build quality is pretty bad within a few weeks the control brick started giving me problems the sound would go off on one side or the other a bit annoying this only happens sporadically and can be fixed by squeezing the sound controller not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement but annoying nonetheless i 've also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws screws that are n't properly inserted and they have a tendency that fall out now i have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone and i ca n't find the tiny screw so i 'll have to either try and repair it myself which means trying to find somewhere i can buy tiny rare screws or have to send it in for repair i might as well send it in for repair because maybe they could also fix the volume controller really kind of disappointing for supposedly premium gaming headphones the microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or ts and the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price i bought some 5 1 headphones for 40 a few years back they only lasted a year but they had none of the issues that the razer has kind of sad that a cheap chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap	9

1	when my 3 month old nephew received this for christmas my 15 month old and 3 year old immediately started fighting over it they played with it so much that we decided to buy our own even though i thought they might be too old for it two months later it is still the hottest toy in our house the shapes are vibrant colors rattle and have rounded edges making them easier than most shape sorters for younger children the top and bottom pieces screw off to remove the shapes and my 3 year old can take them on and off herself my kids also like to lay the top and bottom pieces on the floor and set the shapes on them like it is a puzzle they also like to play catch by rolling the sorter back and forth to each other i would say this is one of the best toys you can buy for a 6 18 month old	9

0	i ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie there 's there 's zero stretch in this it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big since they 're short from crotch to waist anyway it does n't much matter the top fits better since you adjust it the cut is still quite poor and again there 's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders it 's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust it 's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem if you 're narrow through the hips shoulders or bust this combo will probably be a nice fit if you 're curvy you might want to rethink this it 's a shame since it comes in plus sizes maybe i should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit imo	9

1	after starting my 9 11 odyssey from ignorance to full blown what ! after loose change 2nd ed last year i 've watched and or read just about them all 9 11 press for truth comes out on top in my humble opinion as the best 9 11 timeline presentation out there nothing included that is n't in the mainstream press just on the back page and spread out over five years the film makes few of the outright accusations that loose change 2nd ed does towards any of the events or people involved in 9 11 but delivers more of damning argument that we 've been lied to there were n't just mistakes made but distortions and deceit at the highest levels of our government i hope that we the people finally demand a real investigation and the truth comes out and the bad guys pay good movie	9

0	reading through john irving 's the cider house rules i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity in obtaining a bachelor 's degree in english i had to read a lot of books among them were many books that i did not like but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along people become pregnant have abortions and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing the book does n't flow naturally you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows playing the puppet master there are just so many coincidences so many old friends just happening to run into eachother so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly all of the characters vaguely distantly connected to eachother i do n't want to spoil the plot but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames \( rhymes with screams \) family is just too much coincidence to bear it 's as though the author is god and the characters completely lack free will and then there 's the protagonist homer wells i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story homer wells barely does anything in the story he barely even speaks during the story he is virtually a non character devoid of personality or will around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all and they make up the majority of the book are without fail the most interesting scenes i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr larch but even melony seems more real than homer does the story is very long and rambling subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on minor characters keep popping into the story then disappearing only to pop back into the story exactly when they 're needed conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten \( like the situation with debra pettigrew \) after such a rambling at times rather boring plot the ending feels rather rushed it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything tie up every loose end in the last 25 pages \( and tying up loose ends in this case means a lot of people conveniently dying \) to spoil the plot just a little homer wells who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion i personally am pro choice as well but i found that homer 's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily ever afters	9
1	well this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots but if you do n't have good lighting you end up with pictures that are worthless i suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the dx6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures also remember that because you ca n't use the flash option you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots otherwise this lens is excellent it fits easily into my camera bag is simple to attach \( with the lens converter of course \) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect other than the inability to use my flash with the lens i think it is great	9
0	this school bus was smaller than i expected about 4 inches long i bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses he broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package it 's a pull back and go car and he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels they were wobbly from then on this toy is not for kids and it 's not really for playing with from what i can tell very dissappointed	9
0	make no mistake this is the memory card for you if you 've got a gamecube \( which i'm assuming you do or you 're planning on getting one soon \) anyway there are 251 blocks on this baby which may not seem like a lot but it is it gets the job done and you do n't have to worry about it corrupting data or anything i 've had mine for a while and nothing has happened to the files saved on there it 's also easy to save and delete information from this thing with the simple click of a button please do n't get that damn third party memory card from madcatz my experience with that is corrupted data and constant reformating of the card \( which erases your files anyway \) only go with nintendo they 're the only ones who know the divine nature of their memory card i must say though this is for the casual gamer someone who does n't have every game they can possibly get a hold of some ea games for exammple take up over one hundred blocks of memory basically what i'm saying is simple if you 're one who has a ton of games you may find yourself buying more than one of these memory cards before you know it not every game has a save for just the game resident evil for example saves on a different block every time just like a playstation memory card if you 're like me however you probably do n't have that many games that it 's a bother the other thing i must caution is simple this thing like every other memory card is small as hell this one even more so if you can keep it plugged in your gamecube at all times the great thing about memory cards just about everyone of them is simple you can take them anywhere does your same friend also own super mario sunshine \? hey that 's great now you can leave your copy of the game at home and take your memory card it lightens the load it 's essential to have a memory card if you buy a gamecube and this is a good one if however you happen to be someone who has a ton of games this wo n't hold you over long enough and you 'll have to buy another no gamecube owner should be without a memory card though	9

1	sure it would have been great if the chuck jones and dr seuss alliance would have continued for this outing \( their how the grinch stole christmas and horton hears a who are unquestionable classics \) but this is a noble effort a very noble effort the cat in the hat was always been my favorite dr seuss book having said that i felt the top notch vocal talent \( allan sherman will forever be the cat in the hat sorry mike meyers ! \) and whimsical screenplay really fleshed out the book playful theme and the geisel penned songs were truly inspired ! so the animation is a little off this is going to be considered quite the classic when that stinker of a movie opens this winter	9

1	r type final \( 2004 \) introduction over the years irem 's r type series has been one of the finest side scrolling space shooter series out there from its dawn in the eighties to the modern age the series has always pleased its fans serving up its share of uniqueness and challenges alike many installments of the series have graced a number of gaming consoles and arcades alike in 2004 the series finally hit the big consoles of the era the playstation two was the only gaming system that was fortunate enough to receive r type final how did this new modernized version of the series fare \? read on and find out ! overview r type final was released for the playstation two gaming console in early 2004 the game features a number of different gameplay modes configurations vehicles and other variables to keep things interesting the game is a product of the irem corporation review i have always loved the r type series and i was ecstatic to hear that the series was finally getting the next generation console treatment and after finally giving the game a whirl i must say for the most part i am impressed the game stays true to its roots while at the same time incorporating just enough new elements to make the experience fresh let 's see where this game succeeds and where it falls flat the good classic style r type gameplay if you 've played any other game in this series you 'll pick this one up right away the game plays similar in style to its predecessors and as such is very easy to learn if you 've played any other game the series has to offer lots of new elements thrown into the experience when you start the game you 'll have your choice of three ships but you can unlock more there are over a hundred ships total ! the game also features plenty of new weaponry and power up items if you play the game heavily it 's going to reward you well challenging ! if you 're looking for a challenge you 've come to the right place ! this game serves up its fair share of challenging elements and it never lets up even game masters will be challenged ! controls are easy to learn and effective if you played any installment of the series on the super nintendo you 'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this control scheme the bad despite all the improvements it's still the same game even though i like all the improvements this game has made to the series at heart it 's still the same game we played in arcades and on lesser consoles years ago if you did n't like the series then this new installment is n't going to change your mind no immediate regeneration when killed this has always been a huge flaw of this series and i am disappointed to see that this was n't fixed in most space shooters you regenerate immediately after you die right where you died not the case with this series graphics aren't that great for a next generation game granted the gameplay is the most important thing here but still i think they could have done a little better with all of the hardware available overall despite the obvious issues this is one of the best versions of r type i have played to date if you 're a big time fan of this series this installment is well worth checking out if you 're not a fan though this one is n't going to change your mind still if you are one of the many r type fans out there do n't hesitate to give this one a whirl edition notes this game it seems was n't produced for a very lengthy period of time as such it seems to be rather difficult to come by you 're probably going to have to order it online or check around in used game stores this one is tough to come by new	9

1	the overwhelming impression i get from this film is wow these guys are alive ! they are not just making their way through a boring life they 're out there doing interesting things doing cool stuff having adventures generally living their lives to the fullest the they that i refer to includes just about everybody in the movie from paul pena to the guys travelling with him to richard feynman to the tuvans that paul meets and befriends the documentary gets hazy in spots \( i'm still not sure of some of the tuvan inter relationships \) but does a good job of establishing empathy with pena a blind man relying on others in a place far from home the dvd extras are o k the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie i did not watch the film with the filmmakers commentary turned on a commentary seems kind of contrary to the purpose of a documentary but i suppose you could get more factual info technical details on the commentary	9
1	this is the greatest thing i was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn not only has it lived up to my 3 year old but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play it has not torn it sparks great imagination all her friends go to school now this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also and best of all we can store it anywhere when we are done she has even learned to close it up and put it away i highly recommend this bus to all ! !	9
1	this chaise lounge really exceeded my expectations i 'd shopped around and did n't want to spend 400 plus for a chaise lounge this is a great price plus you get free shipping they arrive completely assembled and well packaged very attractive sturdy and most importantly very comfortable i highly recommend got the side table with ice bucket and love it as well	9
1	my 14 mo old son just got his go kart today he loves it he loves pushing the button and making it go he has n't figured out the steering yet but we have a long straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet my 4 yr old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine \( about 40 in tall and 35 lbs \) she received the razor go kart herself and loves it but that one is outside only they have had the best time today playing with the pw go kart i agree with other reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones but they figure out ways to get around it \( the razor go kart also has a thumb throttle control \) we got the lil quad 4 wheeler for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she did n't have the big 4 wheeler now both kids can ride their 4 wheelers together or their go karts thanks santa for 2 great gifts	9

1	i have found that splenda is a great sugar subsitute for a diabetic to use it is great alone on food and also for cooking with leaves no after taste like other sugar subsitutes do	9
1	i bought a copy for a friend recently and she said his music sounds so fresh and it 's so singable the lyrics are meaty too not just fluffy pop i'm kind of obsessing over this music right now which is fun ! thanks so much i 'd like to see him in concert sometime i had this album for a year before i really got into it since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate at first listen i really liked we 'll do it all again and put it onto my mp3 a year later i finally got the album out again and it bleu me away i realize that there is something slightly barry mannilowish about we 'll do it all again because he has some lungs not because of style or anything he reminds me more of jellyfish or they might be giants some songs are so pathetic vulnerable and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album the songwriting is superb and precisely produced the second hidden track is a real gem that you do n't need to relate to in order to appreciate the lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness	9
1	i owned the vhs version of ''the wild wild world'' but decided to get the dvd this winter well that was a great purchase ! i understand people that could see the documentary of jayne in europe as pretty cheaply made but it is still jayne and if you love her \( as i do \) any film she was in \( except the girl ca n't help it and will success spoil rock hunter \) was done on the cheap with ridiculously small budgets 'the wild wild world' gives you the chance to see a candid jayne in all kinds of very campy situations and the best scenes are when jayne pretends to be offended by the goings on it shows a jayne mansfield who was indeed a true original rather eccentric person in the anal retentive american fifties i ca n't help comparing her to what anna nicole smith has done with her 'career' as a media sensation but jayne was doing basically the same fifty years ago which was understandbly much more shocking for the common folks when jayne talks about her film roles you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself i do n't understand how she can be compared to marilyn monroe mm was looking for privacy more serious roles spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to when jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about jayne was not too picky about her roles and the kind of attention she was getting and it was her undoing sad but she needed the money to keep up that image all those children dogs and husbands now about ''the labyrinth of sex'' it is hysterical ! ! and a great choice to make the dvd a double feature just like the good old days of the drive ins ! when you get over the awful dubbing the documentary is rather well made naive to today 's standards of course but well intentionned some viewers will just see crass exploitation but if you are into campy kitsch movies and you see ed wood jr as a genius well you will love it ! the movie trailers are very funny as well and make you wish you could find them so my conclusion is that dvd is an excellent purchase a must have for any serious jayne mansfield fan ! !	9
1	this creatine works very good on me building muscle it has no flavor i recommend it with a good diet ! ! see results in weeks !	9
1	the casio g shock atomic solar watch gw1400da 4av is sort of middle of the road in terms of price \( i paid 99 \) it 's not cheap but it 's not too expensive either the display diameter is not large but it is a thick tough looking watch \( a real man 's watch \) \) it 's also on the heavy side so if you 're looking for an elegant thin watch look somewhere else when i first got it the power source was at 50 charge after leaving the watch on my desk facing up towards a desk fluorescent lamp that was left on the charge reached 100 the next day the solar cell seems to be working the time is accurate too i checked it against the computer time \( which also gets synched everyday \) it comes with a small manual \( with very small text \) but i found that there 's really no need to use the manual at all initially it works right out of the box and all the factory settings were correct \( the manual will come in useful when you have some time on your hands to browse through it to get a clearer idea of all the available features \) the watch 's steel wristband was much too large for me and i had to shorten it \( removed 4 links actually \) i used a swiss army knife blade to accomplish the task the knife tip has to be strong enough to apply pressure to the spring loaded rod that holds the links together but small to get into the small area between the wrist band metal links \( watch for the arrows these tell you where to apply the pressure \) you need to push down on the ridges of the rod and out \( away from you \) \( down so that you can make the rod shorter and out so that when the rod is shortened the wrist band link will pop out \) i did accidentally scratch the band but it was n't too bad since the scratch was on the inside \( it 's easy enough to shorten the wristband and almost everyone who gets this watch will have to do this \) be careful not to slice your finger open always turn the blade away from your finger when applying the pressure overall i give it 2 thumbs up for looks and functionality \( note this watch is sold by multiple vendors on amazon you should check for the one that has the best price when i bought it i was n't aware of this but found out later a little too late \)	9
1	i am very happy with my choice it is just the right size nicely finished with glossy black paint installs in a minute usage is very convenient it has that perfect click into place property you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the stand position to hide it when you are ready to go just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame it does the job perfectly and it feels great	9
0	wasted my money for this slow hub be aware that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipod etc to this device think again	9
0	these were a waste of money they were not properly designed to cover anything much less my backside even though i did order what should have been the right size i realize i have a lot to cover but i ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick i 've still got a pair in white that i have n't even opened ! and wo n't ! it would be a waste of energy !	9
0	this is a beautiful watch but just a word of warning it is big ! i actually returned it for a smaller one the watch face is 30mm which is quite a bit larger than most women 's watches the face was almost the size of my husband 's watch if you like big watches then you will love this one it is beautiful but if you want a normal size watch i would reccommend that you keep on shopping	9
0	i 've owned the new v 3 product for over a week and have still not been able to unlock it for use customer service is worse than i 've ever experienced they wo n't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and i should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works	9
0	the videos are not useable except in the leapfrog leapster i did not know that until i received the order ! thanks alot leapfrog	9
0	this book is offensive to at least one of the two genders though it 's hard to say which it suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot more or less whether that 's more insulting to the male brain or the female body i'm not sure but the book portrays neither gender realistically i like heinlein and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass and it 's not even particularly good at being that the gender swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so but heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo enlightened erotica instead of literature more 's the pity	9
1	i received this product from an amazon com seller for 1 2 the price of what best buy was selling it for it was new and in an unopened box upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere i had spent over 300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd \( directv does not have local hd in my area \) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80 reception with it this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94 98 reception depending on the channel \( directional antenna so reception varies slightly \) i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio but i also get locals with over 60 reception from cleveland \( direction antenna is facing \) but also pittsburgh \( which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing \) great product and no issues with it so far the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector \( if it has a built in hd tuner \) or tv for best results	9
1	i wanted a watch with a metal band and a large analog dial i was n't quite sure that i would like this watch when it arrived it was a women 's style but it was larger than i thought it would be i had to first take it to have some of the links removed but i was amazed at how light it was when i had it on i love the easy to read face and the indigo feature is a must for any watch you own i wear it everyday and i love it it arrived with a brand new battery and the stem was pulled out so you knew the battery was new i recommend this watch	9
0	this is a great magazine but do n't order it through amazon they go through a third party \( snapse magazine \) that has terrible customer service i ordered this magazine in january and six months later still no magazine i called snapse twice and was told they had no record of the order \( even though i received an email confirmation from amazon and i have a 17 digit confirmation number \) they said they would research it and get back to me no one called or emailed me the status so two weeks later i called them again they acted as if i had just placed the order and told me it takes 6 to 8 weeks to receive the first issue i wo n't get my first issue until august buyer beware it could take seven months before you receive your first issue	9
1	this thing is amazing my plasma is like a whole new tv my 60 sony sxrd paired with a ps3 is the best looking picture i have ever seen after using the stv100 this is a must have	9
0	i must agree with the negative reviewers that this pan 's nonstick coating began coming off almost immediately after i began using it i'm not talking about scratches which often are a result of using the wrong kind of implements for cooking and cleaning my pan began pock all over even up the sides where i rarely touch them i hung on to this pan for 3 years simply because i could not bear to part with it for the expense but eventually i had to treat it like my other all clad pans \( which i love \) and use full amounts of oil to cook it was no longer worth using although the reviewer who loves this pan was certain the rest of us who have not liked this pan were not caring for the pan properly that certainty is based on nothing but speculation i cared for my pan precisely according to the directions provided by all clad of course i could have asked all clad to replace it early on since it was clear the nonstick coating was coming off on its own accord but that would not have changed the fact that the coating on my pan was coming off	9
0	this sheet is cheap ugly and scratchy instead buy a portable crib sheet they fit perfectly and are available in lots of colors they are softer and more durable	9
1	i ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them she was n't really used to skating either but has done very well on them not too many falls and learned easily great item even for beginners ! ! ! kim collin	9
0	this book is poor it 's not quot philosophical quot in any sense because it 's not logical and it 's not supported by the majority of music scholars today reimer contradicts himself at every turn he does n't understand what langer is really saying and his absolutist notion of music is completely out of synch with what most scholars argue about music today reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy feel good nonsense	9
1	the basket was a big hit with the ladies at my office i highly recommend it	9

0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	9
0	i bought this item because it said optional belt clip the belt clip is only optional if you opt to leave it on and not use it you cannot opt to take it off i would not call this belt clip optional i would call it will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in	9
0	i see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper which is why i bought it i see now that the description has been corrected but too late for me also the sizing does not run true as the current description states i usually wear 9 5 but i have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes	9
0	myths are important but they should not be labeled history 1 george washington was not a great guerilla leader he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines just like the redcoats washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops 2 ronald reagan did not begin the nuclear disarming of the soviet union eisenhower and kennedy tried but \( lbj \? \) nixon and carter were able to bring the abm treaty the salt treaties and he start treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals reagan did have success with theater wrapons in europe but the big nukes that could end civilization were already being cut back this is an interesting book about reagan and peggy noonan but some of the history cited is wrong	9
1	not as deep as macworld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware very fun to read with a unique style of writing the reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases the majority though are on target the best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds overall a great addition and enjoyable read	9
1	the apple airport card network adapter airport 802 11b was a fabulous purchase it did exactly what it was supposed to was easy to install and test worked immediately the vendor that supplied the airport card was prompt efficient courteous and careful in the packaging very happy with the product	9
0	the wood is very nice but the design manufacturing is very poor my experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating the holes are n't properly pre drilled the hole at the top did n't match up with the cap plate hole which a \) made it very difficult to screw together \( the first screw stripped \) and b \) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly i experienced the same issue with shallow pre drilled holes in the bottom and the bolts not going in all the way i never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions based on the wobbly central column i decided to disassemble mine and send it back	9
0	i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i could n't listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn	9
0	i purchased these as a replacement for some joe weider shorts i have had for many years that have started to wear out i bought 3 pair of these shorts worn 2 of them 1 time each washed them and they both came apart near the seam the seams themselves did not come apart but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run' in panty hose the third pair is still inthe box and i have not worn it but i figure that the same thing will happen with it as well also one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg the one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong like i said very poor craftsmanship and materials	9
0	when given good stories tobe hooper can be a good director to bad this one is n't a very good story this mess came out at the heigth of the slasher movie frenzy but not wanting to be just a slasher movie they try to give us a monster also the theme of 4 kids who now hold on here think it would be fun to spend the night in the funhouse at a traveling carnival before you can say please kill me the thing is picking them off one by one with only 4 teens in the funhouse you would think maybe some fleshing out of the teens would happen but no they just go for the tease scares and even at 90 mins this bore last to long	9
1	these are the softest most comfortable flips flops i have found in years ! you can't beat the price either	9

0	so far so good so what ! \( in it 's origional form \) used to conjure feeling the remastered edition sounds like a group of studio musicians tried to remake the album and just did n't quite hit the nail on the head if you bought this album on cassette when it came out in the late 80s get your hands on that version	9
1	it was more than i expected it was easy to hang looks good and most of all it is as comfortable as advertised too bad i do n't have more places to hang more hammocks	9
0	i ordered the cisco aironet 1231 the other day and after it arrived set it up and could n't get a wireless signal i called customer support and was told i would be called back by a technician \( which obviously the first person was not \) within an hour we waited and got online to try to figure things out turns out that in very small print on an obscure documentation page of the 1231 it says at the very bottom that two external antennae are needed for the 2 4 gh wireless \( 802 11b g \) to work i was even more disappointed to find out that the required antennae were available online for only 16 a piece which makes cisco look really cheap for not including such a small but vital item with a 500 router although it took an astonishing twelve hours for customer support to get back to me since i registered my complaint with them they have been very helpful i really hope that they improve their web site it really is not that helpful since you have to weed through pages of documentation before you can even begin to find information you need i still have n't used this router since i'm waiting for the required antennae i had to order somewhere else cisco routers are supposed to be good but as a warning to you the potential customer be aware that 1 \) you need to purchase external antennae with this product 2 \) my initial experience with customer service was pretty disappointing	9
1	this review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike first off this is my second mongoose i started out on a crappy low end cruiser model so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement the theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website i thought i was getting a white bike and i'm a little ticked it 's actually grey but whateva assembly is n't too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you 're doing the documentation is adequate but do n't expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you have n't done it before the documentation will frustrate you but the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes do n't arrive screwed up like mine did the front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated which entailed messing with the front cable simple enough i suppose but this assumes you know what you 're doing i could n't install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake and wanting to be safe instead of stupid i took the bike to an lbs and had them install it it was then that i found out one of the disc pads was missing no problem i just went back home and found it in the box apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit i did n't even know it was there because i have n't worked with disc pads before it was a good thing i did n't toss the box right away otherwise i would have been sol just be advised however that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing depending on where you are you may or may not be able to find replacement pads you may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake now onto the specs the front disc brake is promax brand dsk 400 which in the world of mtn biking is the generic low end i had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you wo n't find a website it was n't really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better but at least you 'll have a better idea what to look for the documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike go here instead i would n't call the promax disc brake crap but close enough note if you plan on doing any kind of semi serious mtn biking as in on a trail considered intermediate level then upgrade the disc brakes and if you 're planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine then the theory can probably handle it just do n't expect miracles as to the gears there are 21 shimano flavored and they work flawlessly they 're a pleasure to have because there is n't the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end mongoose mtn bikes the only problem i had was the upper gears do n't seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say to 2 then upshift to 3 for example and so forth for the others if you want 6 then go to 5 then upshift and vice versa this may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed as to the ride the theory is a dual suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard tail bike wow just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing you have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it overall this bike is good bang for the buck but i would n't pay over 300 00 tops for it if you 're going to go that high you can get something else with higher end parts oh one last thing if you value your reproductive organs and do n't want to find yourself numb from package to exit and or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle the one that comes with the theory is horrible get a thicker padded gel lined split saddle instead	9
0	this carrying case was a terrible purchase the zipper broke within hours and the nintendo ds lite does n't really fit into it very well i was very disappointed my six year old used his own money to buy a g pak case which is a much better case for the nintendo ds lite	9

1	we started with there goes a dump truck which actually features a different dave this first dave was in the dumptruck tractor and farm truck versions maybe a few others and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is the newer dave \( dave hood \) is in all the rest \( along with his sidekick becky in some \) and is much less goofy than the other dave i do n't think the kids really care though the sillier the better and my son loves them both anyway i started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the tv i do n't let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall tv to things that are at least somewhat informative educational as a result he was never one to sit and watch much tv \( made it hard for me to get things done ! \) but with this series he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles \( and some of the more goofy moments \) so much it really was a lifesaver at times needless to say it did n't take long for me to collect the entire series i have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations my in laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the tractor and farm truck versions with him his favorites include there goes a firetruck there goes a monster truck and there goes a spaceship but he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus ! i ca n't say enough good things about the video series as far as my son 's enjoyment goes just do n't look for any oscars for the acting and editing it 's pretty choppy even for an amateur eye i would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle	9
1	i recieved the mr clean auto dry system for fathers day im usually skeptical about products that are new to the market place and one with the incredible claim that this product makes that it will give a spot free shine without using a towel well quite frankly i was very skeptical about this products claim i used it today and was very impressed it took about 10 15 minutes to dry but when it did my beautiful silver car looked better than when i used a shamois it was very easy and it saved me the elbow work and the 20 minutes i would have spent drying the car i am a big fan of the auto dry system and will never towell dry again	9
1	different visually striking very comfortable the only pedantic problem is that the hinges do seem to rust which may be a problem later on excellent value go look at crate barrel for comparison	9
0	i only wish i had read the previous review before i bought this item i too was trying to convert my hi8 tapes to digital format using the pass through on my sony minidv handycam i bought this way too expensive cable mostly because it was the only option available it seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low end disk drive or graphics card considering the technology involved in those devices but my real problem is with the failure of sony to reveal that the s video connection is useless for input this information is nowhere on the package nor is it on their website there is a notice saying please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase you ca n't read that warning when buying online and if buying at a store there 's no way to know what 's compatible because they do n't include a list of compatible camcorders on the package i guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website then come back to the store and buy it instead of just buying it and seeing if it works there is a section of the handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one however they fail to mention that the sony cable wo n't work despite the premium price they charge if the problem is that they could n't make it work with both a composite and s video cable then they should have just made it work for s video since a composite cable comes with the camera shame on you sony for adding a little aggravation to my day and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard it 's enough to make me want to buy a canon camcorder \( i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i do n't want to submit to proprietary sony standards like memorystick \) rant over	9
0	if you are buying this bed to use at home as a guest bed don't ! i have two areobeds i bought the first one in 1993 when they had just come out the pump is attached to the bed and it needs to be plugged to charge it fifteen years later it still works like a charm i liked it so much i recently bought a minute bed because i needed another guest bed it does not say anywhere on the box that you cannot use the pump without having to charge it first for 24 hours needles to say one of my unexpected guests had to sleep on the sofa the battery is nicad which means it develops a memory so now even if i remembered to charge it the day before it does not run long enough to inflate the bed they do not offer a separate electric detachable pump so now i'm stuck with a plastic carpet that cannot be inflated with anything else the areobeds work great but if you need one that can be used for any unexpected occasion buy a different type	9

0	the playstation controller is nice however the nintendo 64 user would remember that the n64 controller was just a snazzy maybe even more so the xbox controller is like a brick when compared to both the ps2 delivered on a vibrating dual shock controller as standard with the unit this controller feels great with the thumb pads thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement suddenly in 2005 four years after the ps2 was released games like metal gear solid iii snake eater and god of war improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini games feature the controller has been given new life because of this the big negative is the problem that sony ps2 controllers are extremely poor quality this controller for all its design will give you a dual shock first of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the l1 l2 or r1 r2 wing buttons even if you do n't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming the next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw adding up the cost of each controller i could easily have bought myself another ps2 and then some more the cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink i have never seen one that managed to remain straight also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you do n't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it for all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust i have used a very similar logitech cordless rumblepad 2 for the pc that is the same design as the ps2 controller and that is a proper robust model just comparing the two side by side makes the ps2 controller look like it was developed in the ussr in the early 80s or something the fact that sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic ps2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the ps2 unit it is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust i hope sony get it right with the ps3 next time make these controllers more robust please the ps2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the ps2 down badly	9
1	i really like this bike it 's great the only complaint i have is with amazon com customer service the bike came partly assembled you really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble i put the seat and pedals on the quick release for the front tire was missing from the box i called customer service and they could not send me one she said i would have to send the bike back and get a new one she could n't even give me the number of the mfg i was so mad i did n't want to send the bike back that was too much trouble i took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on	9

0	i have n't even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my ps2 after the ps2 logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens i thought it was maybe just that disc but i exchanged it and the same thing happened i called ubisoft and they said many people with the slim ps2 have called to say it does n't work but they do n't have any answers sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many ps2 's do not buy if you do n't want the risk of it not working ! ! ! !	9
1	this bag is great ! very fashionable and protective of my laptop great side pockets and convenient pocket for cell phones	9
1	i used this recorder alot i have alot of classes and the playback is good it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you have n't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record the sound quality is good 36h record time which can be broken up to folders the only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low and that goes vice versa as well nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons	9
1	my whole family loves this tea even our 5 year old we drink it in the evening to calm and relax us when we are fighting colds or sore throats we drink it with a bit of lemon and honey we also put a couple of tea bags in our bath water for a soothing chamolmile tea soak it has a flowery grassy flavor and is best a wee bit sweetened it is one of the best tasting chamomile teas we have tried used in moderation it is not dangerous to your health and is a long standing respected herb in natural medicine people with severe hay fever may not tolerate this tea very well but it does n't affect me and i have wretched allergies and all season hay fever	9

0	bought this because logitech has a great reputation with other products i used this for a short period due to it being uncomfortable and i never found the battery life to be long enough i actually went back to a jabra wired unit until recently when i purchased a samsung bluetooth headset that is comfortable has good battery life and the sound is better i guess i prefer the in ear style	9
1	i finished almost all final fantasy games \( ff1 10 10 2 ff tactics \) i would say that this ff xii is the best gameplay in final fantasy i ever dream off since my childhood i will summarize as follows 1 game play i would rate this 10 stars but here the max is just 5 the game looks boring at first but once you get a party and the a i system \( called gambit in the game \) this is extremely fun the battle environment is superb looks much like real battle no battle scene no random battle everything appears on the map multiple attacks can land on the enemy at the same time the camera view is half global \( you can see everything if there is no obstacle from front behing left right and above not below though since the floor is an obstacle \) this is like the real thing the thing i want to see in final fantasy ! 2 graphic superb the rendered texture looks inferior to ff x and ff x 2 when these two have the highest quality of the cutscene displayed but the over all cut scene is better since in ff x and x 2 there are sometimes that the cutscene looks really bad i am more satisfied to something that is smoothly good on average not too good cutscene and then extremely bad at times 3 music superb thus far no normal battle music but that does not matter the music is not so great when you listen separately but it suits the game environment a lot 4 trivia the town is so huge look like the real town approximately more than 50 100 people you can talk with in each town the costume looks so different it is not just like the old series of this game where the town person in town a may looks exactly alike that in another town if you notice but in ff xii you have to notice meticulously to see that similarity overall everyone looks unique ! another thing i would say that the environment looks much like star wars lord of the rings though i put more emphasis on the former if you watch star wars episode i you will see why i think it looks much like star wars cons i would say that these cons is nothing compared to the pros 1 storyline quite simple no plot twist thus fat i have played not many things stimulate the players to want to know what will happen next unlike ffx that game introduced many interesting plots from the beginning and gradually unraveled them as the game proceeded i would say that if you were to watch only the movies and the cutscene ffxii sounds like a normal battle story in the middle age \( but why there are so many hi tech transportation \? \) 2 voice i would say that the voice actors in this game is quite disappointing they did the good job i admitted but their voices does n't seem to sound good for example compared to ff x the main female protagonist has the unique voice but that in ff xii sounds like typical american people the second main female protagonist in ff x sounds unique but that in ffxii sounds ok not so great the main antagonist in ff x sounds mysteriously great but that in ffxii sounds quite dull the only one that i think he sounds ok is the main male protagonist	9
1	i am a big fan of this magazine but even more so of the free cd when it is good it is very good so i finally subscribed despite the stiff price two issues came i was happy then a third without the cd and then no more after many calls and complaints amazon finally secured a partial refund not exactly what i wanted here 's hoping that the delivery problems can be worked out maybe an opaque wrapper	9

0	i bought this for my daughter when she was 2 i agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product it is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over i still let my daughter play with it but only when she 's being supervised around it and i have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground there are other good shape sorters out there i would n't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard	9
1	after reading several reviews on portable speakers i decided to purchase the sonic impact i f2 for my ipod it has great sound quality the case is durable it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere you can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive this is by far the best accessory i 've purchased for my ipod did i mention that it has a remote control ! !	9

1	been using mr clean autodry system for a while now as long as the filter refill is not used up \( stops deionizing the water \) you 'll get a nice sheeting effect when you rinse the vehicle off allowing it to dry spot free the thing you have to remember is that this is n't a pressure washer or anything other than a system you have to wet the vehicle wash with the system 's soap and then rinse with normal water when you 're ready to dry use the filtered water and then let dry ! best if you wash your vehicle in a shaded area or the soap rinse water will dry leaving spots the only negative i have with it is that it does n't last very long when you 've got a full size truck and a minivan that needs washing after 2 3 washes of my vehicles \( total not each ! \) the filter does n't deionize as well but sure does make drying much easier on these big vehicles ! no more hand drying for me	9

0	as was the case with the previous reviewer i did not receive the item that was described it is not a professional outdoor cooker but a commercial grade cooker in addition there are no baskets included this set up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment what you 'll get is what is shown in the picture not what is described	9
1	i installed this today though i have n't used it that much yet but the quality seems very good and it seems very sturdy i was afraid it might not be sturdy and safe from looking at the photo but after getting it and installing it it seems pretty sturdy and safe to me it also comes with a seat beat to keep the child secure in the seat i'm giving the chair five stars because i ca n't think of anything negative about it	9
0	this wipe warmer does not function simply because the lid wo n't stay closed i waste time trying to get the lid closed while my baby is crying on the changing table the wipes cool off and dry out because of the poorly designed and flimsy lid do n't buy this wipe warmer there are better ones out there	9
1	this 1971 black comedy is still a stitch even if it does n't feel as audacious as i'm sure it once did directed by the maverick hal ashby it is the epitome of all opposites attract love stories as a twenty year old depressive connects with a 79 year old life loving woman they actually bond over their mutual interest in death as they keep showing up at the same funerals however the root of their respective interests could n't be more different maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive while the hearse driving harold simply likes the morbidity of it all the plot is really about their burgeoning relationship while his mother constantly attempts to make the death obsessed harold more socially acceptable first she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates to foil any hope of romance with these women however he stages mock suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother she then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother victor a hawkish officer and vietnam war amputee to try to convince harold to join the army the episodic structure of the story by collin higgins \( years before becoming a director in his own right with foul play and nine to five \) allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions the movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone ruth gordon is her typically pixilated self an archetype she played for years afterward while bud cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide eyed cynicism it 's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later there are funny sideline performances by vivian pickles as harold 's eye rolling mother ellen geer as an overly actressy blind date named sunshine and eric christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest cat stevens' soundtrack has n't aged as well as say simon and garfunkel 's music in the graduate but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings unfortunately the 2000 dvd contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included	9
0	i ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails ! stay away not recommended	9
1	these look great with jeans though i'm not a fan with skirts i bought the black and now wish i could find the bronze in my size i normally wear a 9 and depending on the brand i sometimes need a wide but these i found the 8 5ww fits perfectly go figure naturalizer runs very very narrow i love love these shoes i can dance all night without pain \) they are very cushioned the top straps do not cut at all and the heel height is super comfortable more like a 2 heel i so wish i could find these in other colors in ww !	9

0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	9
1	made my skin smooth and very clean i loved the minty smell will definitely buy it agai	9
0	good special effects for that time period served its purpose to boost the morale of the american public during 1943 the heroic acts by those in the u s military at that time should always be remembered outgunned and outmanned they held their own and then some on wake island and in the philippines however the writers and producer play it pretty loose as far as historical accuracy was concerned no b 17s ever flew from hawaii to wake island and on to clark field in the philippines after the attack on pearl i believe it is common knowledge that no b 17s ever sank the japanese fleet advancing on the philippines remember colin kelly \? what was laughable was the scene where the mary ann makes an emergency landing on maui instead of hickam field on dec 7th upon landing they 're fired upon by local island japanese throughout the movie there are references to sabatoge committed by japanese americans in hawaii on dec 7th 1941 upon landing at hickam field \( because the japs on maui were shooting at us \) a colonel goes on about japanese vegetable trucks driving onto the runway at hickam and crashing the tails of rows of p 40s before the attack never happened in truth there were no acts of sabatoge committed by the japanese population in hawaii this movie only serves to perpetuate the common belief that japanese americans were disloyal and unpatriotic citizens during wwii when in fact this was not the case it should be noted that a good number of japanese americans \( many of whom were thrown into prison camps after dec 7th \) died fighting for the united states during wwii in order to prove their loyalty to this country may i suggest people watch the movie go for broke after watching air force to educate themselves on what really happened in wwii	9

1	i came over from cingular after trying there ptt just not happening for me and i will leave it at that i choose this phone because of the large display and the color of the phone overall \( love blue \) i bought this for 110 00 at a corporate store i get a discount for the company i work for we had a problem with the second one took it back and swapped it for a brand new in the box phone the clarity and ease of functionality is fantastic you dont have to be a rocket scientist to operate this phone and the gps along with telenav is fantastic we also selected this phone because if your not with in range of a cell tower i can still connect to one another like normal walkie talkie 's hey if your going to spend the money do it right the first time i put the extended battery on mine and i get 2 to 3 days before having to recharge which too me is great dont change the default times for backlighting thats whats eating the battery time up also dont leave a java application in suspension that will eat the battery up also buy the data cable and add your own ringtones and backgrounds moto has a phonebook manager package on there site which is free and is so easy to use for ringtones and wallpapers u can use webjal once again easy to use i looked at other phones and i dont need cameras in a phone the primary selling feature was the fact of large numbers and ease of use michae	9
1	the best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars ! ! if you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the internet then this is where the fun really begins ! these secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank \( this is only listing a few \) ! as always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old	9
1	i bought this for my wife a huge fan of patrick o'brian \( she 's read the books twice in the past two years alone \) ironically it now sits in my car 's cd shuffler where it undoubtedly gets the most airtime i love this music ! as another reviewer mentioned with some cofee \( killick there ! \) this music and desolation island in your hand you feel transported to a life of long ago when men sang to rouse the soul brighten the spirit damn the enemy and win the heart of their colleen \( sorry nancy \) all with spine mind and muscle fully intact the harmonies are rich the voices deep and yet the last reviewer 's questions have the faint ring of truth my first hearing rang a bit flat the music sounding just this side of stale but in the end it just do n't signify even on that first run by the end of the cd i was clumsily but merrily joining in with the crew i suppose i have come to imbue the songs with a life of my own belting them out at full volume down the highway i hope you enjoy them as much as i do	9

1	i bought the variety pack and tried this flavor fourth i buy natural snacks for my kids \( freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar \) but i find them bland so i ordered these and i love this flavor in fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it it was n't too spicy for her they use black pepper which is flavorful but i would n't call it spicy	9
1	i had to decide between this camera and a panasonic we trust the sony brand a little more so we went with the sony we were looking for an easy to use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later i also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we would n't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations here 's what i think so far great camcorder to do exactly what we want picture looks great inside and out very easy to use and small enough to carry along almost anywhere still photos are not fantastic \( only 3mp \) but good enough for me color and resolution are acceptable not easy to understand the lcd touch menus but you can configure the buttons once you figure out which buttons you will use the most i got the bare minimums for accessories bought a 1gb memory card \( memory stick duo pro \) glad i did this since i will be taking stills and short video clips to email to the grandparents also got a carrying case dv tapes and an extra np fp71 battery i 'll be purchasing a firewire cable soon \( i'm sure you 've heard the usb cable is inadequate for downloading video \) handycam station does n't really bother me that much but i can see what the fuss is about all things considered i'm extremely happy with my purchase i think this is a perfect camera for a first time camcorder buyer who needs an easy button \( there 's one on the side of the camera \) a little more expensive than some of the others but the price is dropping best of luck !	9
1	all of the peek a blocks are fun although each set has a different 'theme' they are very similar and enjoyable to play with these blocks are great fun each block has something interesting inside it in our house these have been played with by boys and pretty roughly at times the windows to see inside are still clear and not one of these blocks have broken so i would say they are sturdy and hold up well to normal play on the ends of each block is a texture within each block is something interesting and many blocks have an activity associated with it push a button to make a noise twist a knob to make something turn around etc the one thing i would warn is that these blocks do not stack well particularly in tall towers so if you are thinking of buying these for tower building i 'd consider a different set of blocks otherwise these are excellent toys they provide a basis for communication and vocubulary building with your child they are sturdy and encourage language eye hand coordination and so on if you enjoy toys that are fairly quiet do more than have a push button to make a noise foster independent creative play and exploration of the world this is an excellent toy enjoy	9

0	this book is pure fiction nothing more the problem is that is presented as fact albeit little known fact i wo n't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers except to say that i also concur with the criticisms of the book it makes for difficult reading it really is not worth the effort as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end in fact if you are a historian or scholar stay away from it	9

1	i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey there are no other ones like it they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever ! there are n't any other plastic nativity sets out there get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth they love it	9
1	great remake but where 's the fast forward ! my kingdom for a fast forward button ! this was a great game ! the cut scenes were a nice touch that helped draw in the player into the story line but would someone please give me a fast forward skip button i understand that the makers of the game want you to get involved and appreciate the storyline but without a fastforward skip button this game game has a limited replay value i have already played through the game once and now that i am running through it again i am going insane ! the long cut scenes and the seemingly endless next clicks were fine the first time but come on ! for a game that has 3 different endings you would figure that the developers would give you a break ! ok now that i have said that lets get back to the review the character development and use of magical items while definitely not unique but they helped flesh out the fight scenes the combos and skills moves made the game interesting and kept me coming back while i would have liked to see the graphics slightly change when different equipment was used \( swords helms etc \) the combat and special moves graphics were definitely nice should you buy \? sure if you like rpg 's the game is definitely a buy but be fore warned be prepared to read and read and read and click and click and click before you even get to your first fight scene and even then expect to much of the same long before you get to do things on your own	9

1	shaving gives me all sorts of problems i must have super sensitive skin or something i cannot afford laser and wax just is n't my thing grabbed this for myself before christmas on a whim it was money well spent ! after 3 months of use i have gotten the hang of the product i suggest you practise then shave regularly for a month or more say run the product over each leg once till you get used to it then trying to completely remove the hair my legs are unbelievably soft no rash one little tender area after i spent too much time there do keep moving and keep a razor in the cabinet just in case i still have trouble around my ankles hair regrowth is markedly thinner since i began using it by about half what remains still grows long but i'm err what does one call this process \? doing it once a week and only takes a few minutes	9

1	this was the first karaoke revolution game that i received and i enjoy it very much ! however the songs on the game i found were quite old even for someone like myself a senior in college i dont know about the rest of you but the 80 's were a blur for me i didnt know these songs very well which can put a major hinderance on game play i liked the high amount of songs they put on he recent game but i have already ordered karaoke revolution volume 3 after seeing more recent songs that i would know i found the sing and dance mode to be challenging and if you dont know the song by heart dont play it because you need to be watching the arrows for where your feet should be going i would also recommend a wireless microphone for the dance pad \( if they exist \) since a cord will get in the way of your dancing moves i thought it was really cool that the game had a sense of initiative with over 50 different unlockable items \( although 90 of which are items you can use to create your character or just a new character \) some of the songs listed here need to be unlocked through game play i'm sorry i couldnt think of every artist for these songs but if it isnt listed assume its from at least 15 years ago 1 \( i 've had \) the time of my life2 \( you make me feel \) like a natural woman aretha franklin3 ai n't nothing like the real thing4 always5 american woman lenny kravitz6 brick house7 call me8 crazy aerosmith9 crazy in love beyonce10 do you really want to hurt me \? boy george11 drive incubus12 dust in the wind13 endless love lionel richie14 every little thing she does is magic15 everybody wants to rule the world16 everywhere michelle branch17 fame18 fly hilary duff19 for you i will monica20 greatest love of all whitney houston21 headstrong22 here i go again whitesnake23 i dont want to be gavin degraw24 i left my heart in san francisco25 i love rock and roll joan jett26 i will always love you whitney houston27 if you could only see28 i 'll be edwin mccain29 material girl madonna30 me and bobby mcgee31 pain32 pieces of me ashlee simpson33 play that funky music34 start me up rolling stones35 superstition stevie wonder36 sweet caroline neil diamond37 takin' care of business bachman turner overdrive38 that 's amore39 the game of love michelle branch40 time after time41 truth is \( recent but i dont know by who \) 42 turn the beat around miami sound machine \( \? \) 43 unforgettable44 uptown girl billy joel45 waiting for a girl like you46 what i like about you47 who can it be now \? 48 you 're my best friend49 take on me	9
0	i just bought this through amazon and then put it together pretty quickly packaging was lousy as others have already mentioned and 3 pieces were either missing or broken so i had to call for them first customer service rep was ok but the next day i found the pedal crank making a sound and called back but the next rep claimed that i put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears i held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it and he acknowledged hearing the noise but said i would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own the unit came w that part already sealed so i do n't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product although the product appears to be engineered well any company that 's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating	9

0	i bought this for my pony obsessed daughter for christmas mostly because it was the only way to get the breezie zipzee \( one of the main breezies in the new movies \) thank goodness i was n't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets because it did n't even last a day ! after i assembled the braiding handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart not the handle you snap on mind you that was still firmly attatched the rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it ! fortunately she gets enough use out of zipzee and daffidaisy that it was n't too much of a loss that i had to throw it away only hours after opening the box so unless you 're really after zipzee or daffidaisy do n't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings horrible ! !	9
1	i absolutely love this chanel foundation it is lightweight and yet provides fair to good coverage i like this foundation because it does not feel heavy and it is water based it can be worn in the daytime or evening use with chanel loose powder and chanel concealer for a perfectly flawless finish	9
1	these wellies \( rubber boots \) are a show stopper ! i get lots of comments on how smashing they look and they are very functional i wear them in the garden on the beach \( can walk into pretty high water without getting wet \) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking very happy with them and the price was right too	9
0	size 9 5 fit like it was an 8 i wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in and was unable to walk in them at all without pain i 've bought steve madden before many times and know they run slightly small but this pair was ridiculously small and i suspect perhaps mis labeled	9

0	this film is a perfect example of how straight action and big name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama i will not give away the plot although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it basically clooney 's character mr ocean a career burgler is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a las vegas casino so he recruits 11 men each with a talent to add to the operation this is where the trouble begins the viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters there is almost no introduction to many of them and barely even a mention of their names literally half an hour into the film the eleven are assembled and they 're already robbing the casino how 's that for plot development \? and that 's basically it ladies and gentlemen go to vegas rob casino go home movie over some of the good guys are even outright repellant our would be heros' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy hollywood tycoon am i supposed to like this fat weasel \? the only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least mr ocean is that the guy he 's robbing the casion owner is a really bad guy supposedly he has people killed 'n stuff \( this actor played a bad guy in godfather part 3 \) but we never see any real evil deeds in fact he just seems like a handsome polite very prosperous businessman he manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film mr ocean on the other hand and his cohorts are career criminals but the guy they 're robbing is an even greater criminal you see so that makes it ok and really if you were being robbed would n't you want to be robbed by george clooney and brad pitt \? they 're such nice guys that makes getting robbed fun just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy how thrilling this entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with julia roberts there are a few minor things going on in the backgroung like a boxing match which are essentially irrelevent throughout there seems to be vital information missing \( like say a plot \) soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to clooney and roberts this film is also horribly cut several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced and then completely forgotten about take the scene where pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino 's owner makes an appearence the folder he has just been handed explains pitt contains secret security codes you would think that would be something important right \? you would think they will need to get those codes well wrong in fact you wo n't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie they introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development and that happens all the time in this movie in fact mr ocean 's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties \( and boy they started repelling down that shaft quick did n't they \? you did n't even know they were robbing the place yet wow these guys are good or maybe steven soderbergh is as over rated as his film \) they make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7 eleven this after mr ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have one would hope this film would at least end strong but soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed we are left wondering whether the eleven actually got away with their caper or worse what a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light hearted the writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the dvd ! \( as did the actors in their commentary \) probably the best moment on this dvd is hearing the screenwriter tell soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending i am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad but this film comes very close to 1 star this is your standard artistically worthless hollywood product it is big on budget big on bling and low on story i suppose if you just feel like wasting some time this is as good a way to do it as any personally i would rather have a story with more substance	9
1	love love love gerber products and these are no exception great quality and they are so soft the only thing is that the 0 3mths are a little small so you may want to consider starting with the 3 6	9

1	i'm a 13 handicap and i 've never bought a swing trainer before but i saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try it arrived yesterday and i went through the warm up and practice first the grip felt very uncomfortable over the years i had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip this device corrected it immediately although i did n't know it at the time after going through the routine described in the directions i went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls my grip still felt funny but my tempo swing path and release had improved 100 in just a few minutes this morning i went to the driving range the improvement was dramatic my iron shots were longer and straighter but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver after about ten driver swings i got the hang of it and wow ! there 's a screen out at 250 yards on a good shot i usually hit it on one bounce today i was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground thanks david i ca n't wait to get out on the course tomorrow	9
0	i really do not feel tend skin works as advertised the irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed one good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning tend skin helps for that ! just take a strong whiff and you 'll be alert and ready for your day !	9

1	my arms used to get so sore because i 'd blow dry my thick frizzy curly hair for about 1 1 2 hours and then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from wal mart after having a stylist at mastercuts use this on my hair and achieve even better results in under half an hour i knew i had to buy this product this is a great price considering at most places like trade secret the iron alone can cost about 129 plus tax plus the chi products are 15 and up it 's a great value and it benefits a great cause so why not \? so if you have unruly thick curly hair this is the product for you ! just be careful because it does get really hot i burned my ear a bit other than some common sense anyone can use it and achieve great results i tried messing with it to flip out my hair and curl it and i 've almost got it down	9

0	poor quality and flared like a maternity top if you order from lands end thru amazon and the item goes on price break several of the items i have ordered have gone on a price break lands end will not ajust the price you will need to send the item back pay for more shipping and they will re ship they don't charge for shpping and they act like they are doing you a favor the customer service will even tell you that you should have ordered from the direct the customer service will do little for you since you ordered it from amazon and they will tell you until they and you are blue in the face that they can not help you because it was ordered from amazon good luck	9
0	i would agree with previous reviewers in that the burgeoning ads in this magazine over the past decade has made the magazine a chore to read the number of ads now easily exceed the number of pages devoted to articles it is also quite disturbing to note that many of those ads \( possibly 50 or higher \) pitch ultra high end products such as viking ranges bmw 's oceanna cruises trips to bora bora wtf \? although i do enjoy i a luxury meal i do n't want to go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine is selling ocassionally behind the clutter i find a useful recipe i rarely find an interesting article i am going to let my subscription expire at the end of the current period	9

0	i purchased this machine in november 2005 when working it is a wonderful but it started to leak within 6 weeks i sent it back for repair or replacement 3 weeks later i received a badly damaged box not the shipping box but the bodum box the replacement had a manufactures date of 03 04 2 years old it had obviously been used coffee and water stains were present several scratches and parts were missing i called customer service and the supervisor promised they would ship a new one immediately and i would receive it no later than 2 23 2006 three days after i was promised i would receive the new machine it has yet to arrive i called customer service today and was informed they have no record of shipping a new unit and could i call back next week the very used replacement machine was shipped back last week i regret making this purchase	9
1	i do n't know why nobody else likes this product but so far it 's the only one that works for my ingrown facial hairs yes it stings a bit when i put it on but it quickly goes away it does n't dry my skin out it actually helps get rid of the dry white looking flaky skin after i shave i used to get ingrown hairs so bad on my face that they would be there for months eventually i 'd get to the point of having to do my own surgery with a needle to try and extract the hair if i get an ingrown hair now i just use tend skin once in the morning and once before bed and it actually extracts the hair on it 's own ! it gets rid of the redness and swelling also associated with ingrown hairs for the only time in my life my face actually looks clear and tend skin is the product that has done it for me before i finish i 'd just like to add that i'm the kind of person that nothing ever works on any product i try never does as advertised whether it be shampoo deodorant medication etc tend skin is one of the rarities that actually does work for me and believe me i 've tried a lot of products for ingrown hairs	9

1	they had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and i stayed at and i fell in love with it ! i had to have one of my own and thanks to amazon i was able to find one this is an excellent product my husband installed it easily and i would never be without one again one side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good lol and eyelining is a breeze though he would never admit it my husband uses also \( trimming mustash nose hairs \( eewww \) shaving etc \) great product order one you will not be dissapointed !	9

1	you can read it before buying the product by looking on the za site i'm going to make this hard and make you google it i'm not going to criticize anyone except to say if you have a question or problem the za website lists pdf file user manuals for all of the company 's products there are some compatibility probs for example with yahoo mail beta as soon as yahoo finalizes it 's mail server za will be compatible simply switch back to yahoo mail \( pre beta \) there are several other beta products but generally if you 're having problems they can be easily fixed by adjusting the settings just like all security programs za really is better at what it is suppose to do than other products once you have learned how to use it kinda like most things in the world of things that are unfamiliar i use the free stuff too and recommend them for those who are on a budget students etc but the za suite is worth the money and is more effective for those who ca n't afford to get mugged or pickpocketed on the info hiway i know what you 're thinking btw but ask yourself is your private information time and computer worth it to you \? if so go with zone alarm learn how to use it and be safer on the net john rowin1ea	9

1	i bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the 50mm f 1 8 mark i \( the version with the metal mount and distance scale \) that i purchased recently canon specs the discontinued es 65 hood for this lens the great thing about this et 65iii is that it is longer so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full frame or 1 6 frame slrs the interior on this mark iii version is also flocked providing a bit more light absorption i 've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college but this hood is definitely worth the investment well built fits backward on the lens for storage \( but too long while the lens is on the camera \) and provides good protection for the front of the lens \( it 's quite deep \) note that this will not fit the newer 50mm f 1 8 mark ii version \( all plastic mount with no distance scale \)	9

0	on reciept of the tripod i found it wrapped and packed \( on the outside \) in a manner that should have insured an undammaged product when i opened the box i found a tripod that looked like it had been run over by a fork lift and then thrown into the box there was minimal packing around the tripod itself mostly just nylon bags to prevent scratching and nothing to keep the unit from being tossed around i have to wonder about the quality control prior to shipping also if you are not familure with how to assemble and work this type of tripod you will be better served with a different model or company instructions are not part of their package	9
1	i bought this for myself to play with \( i'm 35 \) and after all the presents were opened and toys video games and everything were forgotten \( about 4 hours after christmas \) this was the ongoing favorite of the season everybody younger \( down to 8 \) and older \( to 45 \) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching it 's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such this is a great present for 11 18 boy fair warning though there will be some good spills on the fairly short steep learning curve helmets knee pads blah blah are a must \( and a video camera !	9

1	i have had this watch for a few months and so far it has served me well it is very solidly built and has survived a few falls already it is accurate enough to get me to work on time i do have to wind it about once every week or two mainly because i do n't move my arm enough i think note that this watch is fairly big \( on me anyway \) and the strap is quite stiff when new it has started to loosen up now that i have had it for a while i like the look and i think it is dressy enough to wear with a suit but still casual enough that it does n't look out of place with jeans either a reasonable price for a decent watch	9

0	i bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun i tried installing it on my dell laptop and no dice it would not run i tried installing it on my dell desktop computer and again it would not run when i went to the knowledge base technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card the game will not work on your system in short if you have an over the counter system you cannot run this game on your computer i find this ridiculous and disappointing i would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play especially since these little facts are not listed on the box	9
1	this is unlike any other bar i 've tried i like that it 's gooey green i'm tired of the drier oat like bars it 's satisfying tasty may not be for everyone though i only wish more ingredient percentages would be listed on the amazon descriptions most of these things are pretty high fat ok for a meal on the run	9
0	the ab portion of the dvd is good although i fast forward through the warm ups and skip the cool downs altogether the buns workout is not challenging enough except for the first set the last one is a step type exercise so if you do n't have something you can step up on you ca n't do it the dvd itself is not very professionally done tamilee miscounts does n't look at the correct camera when speaking to the audience and often fumbles her words abs of steel maybe buns of steel no way	9

1	compared to the conair 1 600w i have used for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and high pitched when i first turned it on but you may have a high pitched blow dryer now compared to my old conair and wo n't notice a difference it does n't have a cold air feature which many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to cause less damage to the hair or like me in the summer when the option of switching from hot to cold is preferable these two drawbacks especially having only the hot at high or low setting is why i give it four out of five instead of five out of five star rating pluses price for 13 it ca n't be beat for the frugal shopper efficiency it blowdries my hair a bit faster than the conair did though i do n't understand the science behind that appearance it 's cute and compact weight a toddler could wield this blow dryer with ease carrying ease small enough to fit neatly in just about any drawer or a crammed gym bag under the sink et cetera i have n't had this long enough to rate how durable it is so i hope someone who 's owned one for at least a year comes on to write it 's still going strong	9
0	i should have listened to the other reviewers i wanted to replace my c drive with a faster one and ghost 10 0 says it can do it but do n't be fooled even if you follow the extra steps from their support site \( which are not in the documentation \) you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors it will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site a friend recommended acronis trueimage which i ended using instead it 's much easier to use copies about 2x faster than ghost and best of all it works i cloned and replaced c drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems	9

0	i remember when this recording came out and wynton marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz i picked it up right away i was mystified by the souless mimicry of art blakey 's jazz messengers and miles' 2nd great quintet this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz \? listen as wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements stopping on a dime ! marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars ! ! gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of think of one that strips the tune of any semblence of swing ! ! ! i get it wynton you 've mastered the trumpet technically speaking which is no mean feat and you can read music bully for you the only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say ordinarily i 'd feel sorry for you having wasted all those hours of practice except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you are n't worthy of washing people like john coltrane joe zawinul miles davis wayne shorter herbie hancock i could go on and on but i think you get the point this music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber thus killing it	9

1	this game remains one of my favorite games of all time i'm an old school game i 've played computer games since i had an atari st with cartridge i played the other gta games i liked them very much they are all addictive this one this one is trully the jewel in the crown there are many things i could say but i just do n't want to repeat the same waffle it 's a great game the characters are all superb voiced by great actors ray liotta is just on fire as tommy vercetti i'm still suprised they got all of this talent there seems to be no stone un turned even blondie get 's a minor part this is many thumbs way up indeed it 's notorious it 's not for minors though no doubt there are more minors played this than adults a lot of it 's subject matter are just for kicks just teh kind of amusement we seek because it 's the kind of thing we would never normally do in our wildest dreams the other part inmo is jsut sheer style i ca n't recommend this title enough the only possible downside to it and this is just being picky is the loading times between various parts of the city this was eliminated in san andreas but this one is the one i run this town ! me ! ! tommy vercetti	9

0	this review is in reference to nancy drew last train to blue moon canyon game strategy guide edition i 've played 3 or 4 of the drew games this one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game before i had installed 'blue moon canyon' i had installed morrowind the game of the year edition which sold for five dollars less than 'blue moon canyon' morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has at the bare minimum 400 hours of gameplay and possibly might literally be endless the entire morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15 20 minutes after i had installed and played 'blue moon canyon' we installed and got up and running age of mythology gold also within 20 minutes this is another massive game a real time strategy game that included the expansion pack the titans both 'mythology' games were completely installed this is another game that can be played and explored for years the two game set sold for five dollars more than 'blue moon canyon' or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition the last train to blue moon canyon took so long to download we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone we have a p4 at 3 2ghz an 80gb hd of which only 23gb were used and 1 5 gb of ram there is no reason on earth why nancy drew games should take so long over an hour to download unless their copy protection program conflicted with our toshiba super multi drive drivers the actual installation was not as painful as the download what was painful was the gameplay i had a lot of fun playing the 'secret of the old clock' whereas most of the amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game i liked playing the golf game and the car chase and the bank shots of reflective light beams to be aligned i even felt proud when i finally got the sewing completed i knew that the drew games would n't deliver the value that the two games \( mentioned above \) did but after the reading the reviews of 'blue moon' i expected to have more fun than i did with 'secret' even though i knew it would be short lived what a let down the game was over in two or three hours most of the gameplay was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over or which way the track leaned to the 'arcade' games in the general store were just hit the button or in this case 'click the mouse' you did n't even have to look the most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing it was very boring between the price the concern over the length of the download the most unimaginative gameplay set to walking back and forth on a train i cannot recommend this game as being fun it had a few moments with the math scale problems but it was n't enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to i realize i'm an adult but the eight year old little girl \( i bought it for \) lost interest after the first 15 minutes she was wiser than i sorry nance this one is a waste of money and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts marf	9

0	i had a different experience than the other reviewer i would also consider myself a beginner golfer but the medicus has not worked for me it might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time but if you are trying to improve your swing it does n't help you develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge but it is still a bad swing i heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it but not good for beginners	9
1	i like a cup of coffee with character and thus far this black gold extra bold has delivered the extra bold defines that this k cup carries an extra 20 30 of coffee per serving than the standard k cup and as a result this delivers the extra kick that i tend to like we only brew at the 7 25oz and sometimes the 5 25oz volume on our b 70 brewer as we prefer a stronger cup of joe this roast is on the dark side and delivers flavor with intensity and a nice smoky essence as described i also find that this provides a hint of crema much like a shot of espresso when brewed fresh we like it and if you like stronger coffee we think you will too ! try it	9

1	this toy is wonderful for several reasons for one thing it 's really the only shape sorter your child will ever need it has very basic shape sorting \( with cut out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any shape block to go in \) plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks the toy also helps teach colors and animals and the locks develop fine motor skills even further overall this toy is very well made it 's real wood dove tailed together it could of course fall over but if your child is the 18 months or older that is recommended for this toy he or she probably is n't small enough for it to hurt the locks on this toy are a little more chintzy they wobble which makes locking or unlocking some of them more difficult but you could look at this as just another learning tool my biggest concern is that the blocks are relatively small they could squeeze through a toilet paper tube this means they are a potential choking hazard so you 'll want to supervise when your child uses this toy all that said my 20 month old loves this toy and plays with it more than anything else she has	9

1	i purchased the extention kit for the superyard xt play gate to go with the play gate that i purchased it works great for my new pomeranian puppies the play yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe it will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves the fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so i can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be i love this item and i am very happy i purchased it i feel the gate is great for animals i have not used it with children as of this time	10
1	but no calories count i love this watch despite that it 's well designed the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym \( most that say polar ready \) so that was a great surprisethe chest strap has a battery that is user serviceable as well as the watch so you do n't have to send it to the manufacturer \( like the polar hr \) overall i think is a good buy but the is missing the calories count that would be my only upgrade	10

1	this update of the old big wheel style green machine is made to handle the height weight and wear and tear of big boys \( and girls up to the latter 30s have even been caught on it \) yet the seat is easily adjusted so that the average 5 year old can reach its pedals the main cool feature is the dual lever steering just like with the original hollow model plastic version pulling on the steering levers in opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin out that kids just ca n't get enough of yet under the usage of some pretty crazy 6 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway the machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground so first i am amazed at the staying play value of this toy for two years now it has been the first toy out of the garage every time the door opens and second i am amazed at its durability the 9 year old who uses it reguarly is an evel kneivel who is notorious for breaking my children 's toys left and right and so far it has held up without a squeak this was a million times better value for our hundred spot than the darn motorized motorcycle we bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only lasted a year before the gears stripped definitely consider this for your 5 10 year old boy even if he already has a two wheeler it 's a whole different kind of fun all the way	10

1	hard to imagine something could make one 's honey even sweeter but this fills the bill the little jars make it easy for you to try different flavors \( as opposed to being stuck with a large quantity of one \) all of them were quite yummy too the only thing i would change is the brush that 's included it 's tiny which makes it fun to tease and do little bits at a time but it could be just a bit broader the bristles tend to get overwhelmed by the chocolate then you just use your fingers	10

0	somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers a nice zooper 3 wheel outdoors stroller a maclaren umbrella stroller and in the middle this red peg perego aria stroller we have had nothing but bad news with this aria stroller what a clunker ! as an italian i am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous i am only being slightly facetious this stroller is very sleek and stylish and light weight but that is where it all ends the biggest flaw is the poor handling wheels pushing and steering is a constant battle sometimes it just does n't want to go i have really tried to inspect where the problem is and it does not look like the wheels stick rather the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what i mean other nits include the aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off and the baby 's cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable but the biggest problem is the handling it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore	10
1	i had all but given up hope on electric can openers until i bought this one you can tell when you pick it up that it 's of good quality \( not cheap plastic junk \) the removeable head is also very solid heavy duty and washes easily in the dishwasher the black and chrome design looks very stylish on my kitchen counter as well i'm a believer again in electric can openers	10

1	this is the third of three of these clocks that i have purchased for our city council chambers at first i was somewhat leery that the location of our chambers would make it difficult for the clocks to automatically set themselves via the radio setting but this turned out to be unwarranted as a result we have three clocks now that automatically keep perfect time all synchronized and all automatically adjusting for daylight savings time and standard time in the past keeping three clocks in one room synchronized was impossible and was made more difficult since these were 15 feet up on the wall the features of the temperature and humidity were an added bonus the price was about 25 as much as compared to other clocks our city was investigating in all i am totally impressed with these clocks their operation and their pricing so much so that i bought two for my home and one for my travel trailer	10
0	my daughter bought this for me so i could see my grand children who live in other states i have spent 6 days and almost 450 trying to get it to work i even hired a computer repairman who charged me 184 and could not get it working if it was not a gift i would send it back to get my money back i called the help line lots of times and usually got someone who did n't speak english very well they would end up telling me it was a problem with the router then i would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the d link no one wants to take responsibility for getting it working i even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong tried them all in six days and i still do n't have it working and has cost me alot of time and money good luck if you buy it you will need it	10

0	the topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth 45 but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page the shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5 16 long the larger stone is about 3 16 wide and 1 4 high the small stone is about 3 32 wide essentially you get what you pay for	10
1	shadowbred by paul kemp is simply an excellent book the story is incredibly engrossing the atmosphere set for each scene is really top notch and the journey paul takes his character 's through is really incredible we see personal demons and struggles of the heroes struggles with faith the journey of an anti hero to a hero and whether he can really make this journey the villains are equally deep and interesting and frankly human if you are a fan of fantasy literature definitely pick this one up you wo n't regret it as a side note you might want to pick up the previous books by paul featuring erevis cale as well	10

1	as a working mom this was a book i could n't resist of course i do n't bear much of a resemblance to the mama in this story but i think my toddlers \( both boys \) get the picture the comforting notion seems to resonate with them that after a long day mama will come home to the sweet bedtime routine	10
1	this is a wonderful vangelis album and is fairly energetic with enough experimental flourishes to keep the listener fully engaged released in 1975 heaven and hell incorporates a full choir into the vangelis sound vangelis played all of the instruments on this album including synthesizers electric piano acoustic piano a full drum kit and percussion vangelis is joined by the english chamber choir \( conducted by guy protheroe \) with vana veroutis as the lead female vocal in addition to jon anderson \( vocals lyrics on heaven and hell \( part 1 so long ago so clear \) vangelis is quite a good musician and really shines on the acoustic piano as a huge yes fan i was delighted to hear jon 's excellent voice and cosmic lyrics as far as the inclusion of the choir goes i did not mind it that much and felt that it added a very interesting textural element to the recording the heaven and hell suite is divided into two lengthy movements including part i \( 21'58 \) and part ii \( 21'16 \) in general the first part is more orchestral in nature and features the choir and excellent acoustic piano playing by vangelis another general observation is that the first movement mixes vigorous sections that feature drums with spacey and haunting synth dominated passages of course my favorite part comes at the end of part i which is the 4'58 section with jon on vocals this short song is quite moving and uplifting movement ii is a little darker and more experimental than the first movement and is my favorite of the two the choir is featured on the second movement along with a beautiful wordless vocal by the very talented vana veroutis part ii closes with a very spacey and quiet synthesizer section which provides excellent contrast with the preceding thunderous percussion section all in all this is a good vangelis album and is recommended along with albedo 0 39 \( 1976 \) spiral \( 1977 \) and the excellent opera sauvage \( 1979 \)	10
0	i 've contacted the manufacturer for an alternative way to hook to crib they were less than helpful i am thinking about returning the entire set i'm so disappointed	10
1	this game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available but today with doom and half life versions for xbox there is actually something to compare halo to and it does n't stand up first off the plot is utterly pointless i never felt invested or sympathetic to master chief just frustrated when he died that i would have to replay a section the weapons are lame released after the pc version of quake iii halo 's weapons seem limp in comparison none of the futuristic aspects seem particularly believeable or useful for that matter the vehicles suck driving the vehicles in halo is as fun as operating a forklift which is actually quite entertaining in gta san andreas so maybe it is not quite that fun i guess it is more like driving that super action wacky bike from the southpark chimpocoman episode 2 player story mode rules ! the best part of the game and the only reason to reccomend it is it is a great game to play with a friend multiplayer deathmatch is average give halo props for the first decent multiplayer battle for xbox but it was n't as good as it 's pc competition when it came out the much older quake iii still looked and played better and now seems ok but no better than most that said the 2 player campaign and multiplayer make this a good 10 15 diversion just do n't expect the immersive atmosphere of doom iii or the intriguing plot twists of half life	10

0	this is where ordering a book through the internet is a little disappointing as you ca n't browse the book before purchasing it quot camping activities for kids quot is very light on the quot activities quot it does a good job of laying out items that should be brought along on ones first camping trip but falls short on suggesting outdoor activities for kids the activities that are suggested are a little simplistic for example quot laying sticks apart from one another and pretending it 's a river and then have the kids jump over it and playing golf with sticks and using pine cones as balls quot i was hoping for more endepth activities if it 's your first time camping this books okay but if you 've camped for awhile and your kids are a little older the book falls short so look for something else	10

1	despite having some trepidation after reading the reviews of owners who had unpleasant experiences with the sg4 i bought it and am glad that i did my experiences using the sg4 during play have been very positive even though on occasion the weather conditions have been so bad that i could only get a signal for some of the holes the large screen allows the user to easily see each of the obstacles on a given hole and know the distance to them and the distance required to carry them the sg4 also provides a more detailed view of each obstacle as well as the distances to the front edge center and rear edge of each green for golfers who like to know the exact distance they hit each of their clubs the mark feature is marvelous being able to have all of this valuable information available for 10 professionally measured courses and 5 personally measured courses is of significant value for golfers who play a number of different courses not only on a regular basis but also for courses being played for the first time the sg4 also has a memory card slot for being able to download more courses when that service is offered in the future i think the the downloading procedures on the sky golf web site are somewhat confusing but not very difficult to figure out and use with only a few minutes of effort i know several low and mid handicappers who love this device and i share their enthusiasm and opinion i am a high handicapper i also own a bushnell pinseeker 1500 with slope and consider the sg4 to be a far superior tool to the bushnell note there is at least one additional cost that buyers will incur after they receive their sky caddie the subscriber fee for downloading courses for 1 year the fees range from 30 for courses measured in one state that you designate to 80 for worldwide use	10

0	i was n't expecting disney but i was less than thrilled by this feature i'm assuming there 's a genera of animation produced in the mid 70 's that took the whole 'stoner' heavy metal thing and ran with it many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story i am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything but i could n't get through this whole film	10

1	i 've been getting this magazine since it first came out years ago and every issue is just as exciting as the first it not only gives you the military aspect of events but often goes into detail as to how and why these events occured which is invaluable in itself i ca n't wait for the next issue to come out and wish it would come out more often and the fact that it comes in hardcover format makes a nice presentation on my bookshelf thank you mh	10
1	i like that the gloss is n't goopy or sticky and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while but you do n't get much product i bought flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips i was n't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen but overall i do like it but do n't know if i 'd buy it again	10

0	i found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion \( not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford \) the whole magazine is one big ad if i wanted that i could just turn on the tv	10
0	if this gauge cost 20 i would give it a high rating but even at the discounted 35 price i see for these gauges i think it is bad value let alone the nearly 50 it cost me ! as mentioned hose is very inflexible at cool not just cold temps general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this mine is now leaking badly and i am trying to repair with quality materials as i still hope to use the gauge part anyway i would not buy again	10
1	i purchased this as a christmas present for my husband it arrived in a timely manner \( just in time for christmas \) and in great shape he really never asks for much but he wanted this we went to the smokies for christmas and he got to try it out searching for gold ! needless to say he loves it ! i would highly recommend it for anyone looking for some fun	10
0	the real headache began when i attempted to activate the program i spent hours trying to activate it to no avail i got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems now i would just like to get my money back i have used scansoft 's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it but for whatever reason omnipage 15 has become for me an expensive nightmare after having spent many hours trying to activate it i still have not succeeded their support leaves a lot to be desired for one thing they keep bankers hours so do n't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours	10
1	the reason i liked this game so much was the story line it gives you choices to whether you want go to the light side or dark side and you could enhance a variety of jedi powers i have played this game serveral times and each time is different the first time i went through this game i relied a lot on my swordsmanship with my lightsaber the second time i played this game i relied more on my jedi powers either way you play it i developed a different set of moves it was awesome ! also i love the fact that you can play a woman ! ! in every other star wars game \( except this sequel \) you have to play a man and it gets a little irritating when you like adventure games just as much as any guy i give the story line and the capabilities of the jedi five stars	10

0	this item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly also it does not work well at all if you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least many times it stays flat and when it does rise it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs i would have returned the item but i left it for my mother when i had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time i returned my 30 day window was closed do not buy you will regret it if you do i wo n't even put this item in a yard sale because i would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it	10
0	the watch is quite lightweight and comes with good features however i think it is very hard to use you have to hit the buttons just right and for the certain amount of times to change anything if you lose the directions you will never remember how to change it it took me over 6 months to change it i had many people try to alter it but it was to no prevail additionally the watch is not very water resistant i went swimming a couple of times and now i hardly see the time due to the water i would recommend paying more for a lot better watch for this was a waste of money !	10
1	this is the best sound machine out there i worked in a doctors office where they used these and they were amazing my husband cannot sleep without some sort of white noise we purchased this and our sleep could n't be better best bet for the money it 's also adjustable as far as volume just twist the top very quick shipping as well	10
1	this is one of the best literary journals i have seen in years ! the content is broad and interesting \( a good mix of fiction and poetry \) and it seemed like i had a new surprise in store for me every time i turned the page	10
0	i really enjoyed goodbye lenin and it was mostly on the basis of seeing thatm film that i decided to watch this one the film follows three idealistic politically right on young people rebelling against what they see as unthinking selfish and uncaring bourgeois consumer society this rebellion takes the form of breaking into rich peoples houses moving their furniture around and leaving notes like 'you are too wealthy' very situationist \( never mind the fact that this point is probably largely lost on the rich people they break into \) all this is fine and well but the problem with the film is that on the one hand it glamourises these young people and on the other paints every single other person in the film as some rich ignorant bourgeois pig in the first ten minutes or so i thought this might be a clever bit of directing in which we view society as seen through their eyes rather than society in its reality however this was n't to be the case the world remained bourgeois the kids are alright the older generation bourgeoise are bare cyphers and none \( with the exception of the man they kidnap \) is given anything like a personality when a break in goes wrong and they have to kidnap the rich man who lives there and take him away to a shack in the hills during this time they decide to 'educate' him about the wrongs of the world and the rich man 's part in them the rich man barely challenges the young people at all and accepts much of what he has done is probably wrong the anti capitalist argument running through the entire film is very one sided i could appreciate the film a little bit more if it was balanced but this was n't furthermore there are all the usual cliches associated with this type of work the edukators are young good looking and artistic the subtext being that because they are arty they can see things that others ca n't at one point one of the characters is on a bus when three men \( presumably police though its not made clear \) hassle a drunk for not having a ticket the character angrily bursts in and tells them to leave the drunk alone gives the drunk his ticket and gets off the bus do drunks even get hassled on buses by gangs of police \? ca n't say that 's my experience amybe they do in germany this is a recurring problem with the film situations designed to show the main characters in a good light are contrived and unrealstic the anarchist marxist anti capitalist dialouge the characters preach is so generic that it actually ends up being meaningless by the end of the film you do n't actually know what exactly they stand for or what their solutions are to the problems of society basically the one sided political argument hamstrings the characters development their views are never challenged so they do n't change it is left to the kidnapping and love triangle to create the conflict in the film the ending is also unbeleivably cynical and completely undoes any idealism that had been generated in the course of the film generally it feels like a script written by a 1st year politics student being so utterly simplistic in it 's 'the rich are all bad' message i would recommend this to anyone who is 17 years old and angry at society but at the same time i would n't recommend it to anyone who wanted some insight into how we should solve the world 's problems there has been a rash of good political films lately good night and good luck syriana the constant gardener unfortunately and given so much potential this film is not one of them shame	10
0	let me accept the fact that lotr is my most beloved film and i already own the extended editions of the films in one set ! i'm really not surprised to see new line coming up with another edition of the trilogy with films like these they will squeeze the collectors as much as they can ! ! still inspite of this new set containing both the theatrical versions and the extended cuts of the films and also the much hyped costa botes documentaries my advise to anyone buying lotr for the first time is do not buy this set ! spend a little more and you get all the movies in full 6 1 dts ex glory alongwith hours of endless in depth bonus features which probably you 'll spend rest of your life watching ! ! please be aware these new editions do not contain dts tracks no commentary tracks by the director weta workshop or the cast all you get is both versions crammed into one single disc and just one documentary as a bonus on the second disc and nothing else it would have been a better idea had new line released the documentaries separately without forcing the consumer to buy the films again and even this is not the end once the hd format gains a little more acceptance they 'll have another excuse to come up with a new version of the trilogy ! beware extended edition set is the ultimate lotr experience in terms of films or bonus features go get it its worth all the money spent !	10
1	good product probably the best digital frame in the market drawbacks are the user interface and the difficulty to set up the wireless connection	10

1	this magazine is fun and upbeat the pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text if the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying there are many many recipes one section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week a great magazine well worth the money	10
1	i bought this camera for my teenage son the only problem we have found so far is that the battery life is too short other than that it is a good camera the slim design is nice and the camera is loaded with features	10
0	a simple dvd player as long as you or a friend own an x box console simply push in a little plastic knob into the controler socket and their you go oyu know own a standard of the line dvd player the maginfacation is great the rewind and fastfrward is great it has all the extras a normal dvd player has and a easy to operate menu and layout no overloads of pointless buttons just point out the obvious structer you may be dissapointed in the response time but that is not entirely the remote or players fault if you own an old x box console or a low memory x box console you may encounter slowness and maxed out freezing some mint condition titles may not even work \( i purchased little nicky sometime ago mint and to this date it still does not work on my x box console \) batteries may play a roll with out a doubt though this is the most easy and portable dvd player around with the acknowledgement of owning an x box console first a must have for a gamer movie lover wit ha large movie library or a constant renter	10

1	i would argue that since we really have n't evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out and despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace in mary harron 's american psycho it comes out in all the wrong places the film is a character study of one patrick bateman \( christian bale \) a wall street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him it 's not just the suits and the empty conversations either it is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card he tries to talk about his problems he really does but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period to their ears murders and executions is interchangeable with mergers and acquisitions the film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980 's this particular gordon gekko is overdone and overacted by christian bale in a great performance he is robotic phony arrogant and absurd he is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so \( all the while flexing his biceps \) more than anything he is militantly materialistic he is dexter mixed with jim profit only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co workers head the whole point which is made clear in the final scene is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts just because these people make enough cash to swim in scrooge mcduck style does n't mean that their behavior is excusable harron paints the modern businessman as an american psycho and it is all too fitting to make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off you must be turned into patrick bateman the film is a great success as a horror movie villain patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever every scene has great energy to it and even though bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you ca n't stop watching him there is something of a conflict presented when willem dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of patrick 's murders that storyline is interesting while it lasts but it is never quite wrapped up i would also admit that after awhile i got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters he may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but i eventually did the character is endlessly fascinating \( what is up with his love of cheesy 80 's music \? \) and the scene where he kills paul allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized the male need for aggression is n't going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it otherwise we are going to have a lot more patrick bateman 's and iraq wars on our hands 3	10
1	i got this burner for home brewing beer at the recommendation of one of the homebrew forums i read regularly the box arrived in a little bit rough shape but everything worked great very easy to use just hook up to a propane tank similar to the way you hook up a gas grill it generates a lot of heat ! this is a mixed blessing as it gets a good boil going but i found it a little bit difficult to control the heat \( getting it to slow down enough to not over boil \) for my own use i run it with the lowest amount of air gas available \( lowest flame \) but if you are in need of serious heat or doing some serious outdoor cooking this burner does the job ! pros lot of flame easy to use easy to setup cons little difficult to control the heat as the lowest setting still runs a bit hot	10
0	the pipe is too wide to let the two plactic disks run smoothly i could barely assemble it together because it would not fit maybe they sent me wrong disks i do not know but i am very dissapointed with this purchase it does not work as well as i expected also gofit web page does not have the exact description of the item as it is indicated on the box that they send it packed it waste of money i would better buy it at the store and try it how it works	10

0	my primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting without the use of a flash the camera could n't handle taking pictures without the flash at all despite it being extremely bright in the room \( 5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights \) the camera 's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that was n't blurry maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear i believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it i used to have a cannon powershot sd450 that was awesome but it was stolen and so i needed a replacement i had no complaints about the 450 and it took the same type of pictures in bright indoor lighting just fine without a flash unlike the 900 i am sure the camera would be fine for people who always use the flash or take their pictures in bright sunlight but for my purpose this camera was horrible and it has since been returned instead i just got a fuji finepix f30 which is supposed to be better without the flash we 'll see	10
1	this action figure is sitting on my desk at home he 's my little computer buddy it 's really not bad at all although the plastic hair does n't allow his head to move very much when i'm writing and i get to a point where i need to back off a bit i pick him up and change the pose or threaten my daughter with the masamune or she and i set him up for a couple of humourous pics it 's great all hail sephi ! ! \( and you can just hear it why the heck are you calling me that \? well why not \? it 's weird and it 's not right ! but sephi \) hahahaha ca n't wait to get cloud too then things in my house will be interesting	10

0	in the past i have considered amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites to be perfectly honest i am no longer sure two months ago i bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on amazon this camera set was called the 1 gb stylus 720 sw kit ironically the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 gb cards ! my first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories two weeks after receiving the kit i emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake after waiting a few weeks for a response i decided to send them a second email again no response by this point i felt helpless and turned to amazon for aid surprisingly amazon was not much better than 47th st photo minutes after sending the email to amazon i received an automatic email informing me that amazon had received my email that was the last i heard from amazon more than two months have passed and i have not heard from either company	10
1	i 've been a p w subscriber and reader \( even when not a subscriber \) for years i 've also tried various other writers' magazines such as the writer and writer 's digest the latter two were fine when i was just beginning to dip into the freelance market just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts but when i gained more experience i soon realized those just did n't make the cut anymore the articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that i was no longer gaining new insights p w was the next step up p w provides advice inspiration informative interviews current resources for the more experienced and discriminating writer the bimonthly issues include articles detailed listings of markets contests grants and helpful relevant ads for the price this is the best magazine available today for the writer who has a portfolio already underway and keeping an ear to the ground for more staying up to date with what 's rumbling in the literary world with its up to date information i 've been able to leave the others aside including that old bible writer 's market which was unfortunately obsolete the moment it was off the presses highly recommended for the writer wanting more	10
1	the coverage always seems nice and varied there are the elaborate took me a week to prepare meals alongside the quick throw together meals and helpful side notes about products and ingredients i also like the tangential coverage for dining out wine and travel \( to good food places !	10
1	the best buy i have ever found on 1000 count sheets ! they are excellent quality	10
1	i like these a lot they are only slightly salty with a bit of molasses sweetness all balanced against a mild licorice flavor they are medium hard and very chewy although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard personally i would prefer a stronger licorice flavor but these are still among my favorites salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who have n't tried it before if you 've never had it before do n't start with a case \( like what 's sold here \) and definitely stay away from double salt licorice until you 've learned whether you like the saltiness if you want black licorice but do n't want the salty flavor try haribo licorice wheels those have more licorice flavor than these coins and less other flavor they 're a bit sweet and a bit softer note that these coins also come in bags buying them that way is slightly more cost effective but the tubs might be a little more airtight	10
0	although my 3 1 2 yr old loves this belt it barely fits him it only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go in fact my 1 1 2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro the smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face my son loves it for the brief time it sort of fits him but i am disappointed with the quality and the size	10

1	i grew up with the original ds i also saw the two spin off movies house of dark shadows and night of dark shadows needless to say i was extremely excited about the revival and i was n't disappointed i felt that dan curtis was actually able to improve upon the original by tightening up the script and employing wonderful actors who fit like the proverbial glove the original barnabus was played by jonathan frid who was a shakespearian trained actor and ben cross is a member of the royal shakespearian theatre in london i loved that the revival was able to be more overtly sexual which as any fan of vampires must know is an essential element of the myth and i must say this series lived up to my every expectation dan curtis took the original and made it completely accessible to older viewers who have such fond memories of the 1963 soap opera i looked forward to 3 30 every day after school it 's too bad that the gulf war killed it yes it did ! i was there after the sunday monday miniseries that friday was to air the first episode however it was pre empted by coverage of the war too too bad i taped it but unfortunately the last few episodes were accidentally taped over i am so glad to know that i can order it now in it 's magical entirety i'm ordering it right now ! thank you amazon ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you are a fan of things that go bump in the night you will love this series ! ! ! !	10

0	i was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much i thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything but when i tried it i discovered 2 things first off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place \( which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one \) and when i finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it 's on it only burns about a calorie a minute this bike might be great for arm workouts because it does n't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance \( though i only tried it for a few minutes \) but definitely not for your legs	10
0	i purchaced this product because its a great idea the problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway	10

0	it holds my bike but seems unstable i still ca n't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards plus probably the biggest concern there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack \( user must tie the bike down every time \) my bike has n't fallen off though	10
0	this is a nice book but it does not contain provencal style interiors ! i am not sure how the author came up with that title since anyone who is interested in french country will not find it here if you are truly looking for provencal decorating ideas this is not the book for you confused ! !	10
0	i received my order today and discovered \( as with all of the hasa products in my order \) that although more than one item is pictured only one comes with the order the item itself is very small 2 1 2 x 1 that fine i can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood lifesize would make play a work out for most children however shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for one item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising	10
1	this is the first clay bar system i used and it 's still the best you absolutely need to use this before you wax or else you 're just waxing those impurities into your finish creating more annoying swirl marks doing this step before you wax is a bit more work but it 's worth it i could live without the mother 's wax they include with the kit as i do n't use it but i always use this before i wax my car that glass like feeling your paint gets is amazing	10

0	sorry to give such a bad review but i ca n't in good conscience give a better one i did this workout one time with the 8 lb ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since i am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed up lower back there are several segments \( including ab work \) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side to side while doing these moves i kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight sure enough by that evening i was dying ! perhaps they 'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball i am in good shape and have actually been doing the p90x extreme workouts i am accustomed to using 20 40 lb weights and do tae kwon do and i do not have any back problems i snatched this up when i finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day just be forewarned it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout i love all the other firm workouts but will never do this one again additionally when i received this from amazon the ball was misshapen the dvd case was broken from the weight of the ball they immediately sent a replacement which was damaged in exactly the same way	10

0	beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful ! not to mention the monsters level up with you so you 'll never be at an advantage you could pretty much beat the game at level 5	10
0	a sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise but this one does n't also the construction leaves something to be desired it 's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks where the seams are sewn i bought two after trying them several times i gave up and sent them to charity do n't bother	10
0	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	10
1	i am in the army and because of that this watch has it 's pluses and minuses i travel the world so the multiple time zones is awsome the time stamp feature is great for when i need help remember when a specific event happened as for the solar power it 's great in that you do n't have to worry about batteries but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway in the army i find myself doing lots of night missions and i can go months without seeing the sun because i have to catch up on sleep during the day well this does n't really work with a solar powered watch i get by but it can be a hassle some times all in all this is a great watch and if you do n't work at night then the solar power wo n't be a problem for you except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist just take that into consideration when purchasing a solar powered watch	10
0	i am a time person of the year 2003 \( shared title actively deployed u s servicemembers \) i must say that reading time magazine is like reading the platform for the democratic party actually it is even worse than that it is like reading john dean 's diary filled more with fantasy and personal wishes than actual reality one of the latest from the online edition is that realists have taken over washington give me a break a new set of hogs have come in to take over at the troff and that is it anyone who believes nancy pelosi and her gang of political hacks is going to help america is a fool best thing we can hope for is that they create so much gridlock that no one can spend any money in washington maybe then they will see that america improves on its own and politicians on both side make things awful the sad thing is that people that read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something about the world this publication is so biased that it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try to repeat what they have learned if you want a truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe to the economist it probably will not change your political affiliations but it will at least make you sound competent when you debate others the economist is quite simply the best weekly news magazine in existence the articles are well written by people that know what they are talking about leaders from around the world read and contribute to the economist this is something that time newsweek and the rest of their ilk cannot claim i am not affiliated with any political parties and do not consider myself political i look at things from an economic perspective and vote accordingly	10
0	if you like this book you will probably like bless the child by cathy cash spellman they are very similar this book can be summed up in one word simple simple minded simple characters simple plot \( applied loosely \) and simple premise what a contrived piece of garbage ! i ca n't describe everything wrong with this book because there 's not enough time if it 's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through if it 's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims in denial weak worried about what everyone thinks or oblivious if it 's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author 's plea for that is irritating that 's how bad this book is ! it can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying this author has no style the book reads like an episode of inside edition there is no immersion into the story the total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them as a reader i felt completely outside the story an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario the attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable i 've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn the only reason i read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me do not waste your time i must say though that this novel was inspirational if this crap can make the best seller list it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published	10
1	this game is awesome ! it is addictive though so be prepared a little complicated once you get started but becomes easier best if someone already knows the game to teach it really fun though	10
0	i found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use you ca n't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on you can move hot plates etc but you ca n't really carry anything with the mitt on not worth the money albeit not very expensive	10
1	these crackers are great for the natural health conscious family as well as anyone else who loves goldfish or other cheese crackers they taste great and are all natural with organic wheat nothing weird you can actually understand what every ingredient is ! \( how refreshing \) plus i love this new big box 12 oz instead of regular 7 5 oz not only does it save packaging and cabinet space but it 's a better price per ounce ! great for us because we go through them so fast now that these are available here i also do n't have to go to the store \( some of my local stores do n't carry the big size anyway \)	10
1	these speakers can almost hit any range of sound but if anything they are a little weak on the bass side they put out very crisp sound for my system you might want to add a sub to them for complete range sound	10
1	i have used tax cut for several years have had no complaints it is easy to use and is very complete plan to use it again next year	10
1	i love this book it 's beautiful this book is a delightful romp through the farmyard with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly causing the ruckus with all the animals the abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and therefore may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend the pigs in the muck the kittens in the hayloft the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish but a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing fleming 's gorgeous art each time my nine month old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter this is definitely one of his favorites i highly recommend this book	10
0	calling all brighton mums ! this magazine presents a relatively contrived viewpoint on contemporary interior design smothered in advertising for crisp white bed linen and pressed quartz bench tops a pretty lousy effort as australia 's top selling interior design magazine though designed for the wealthy mainstream brighton market vogue interiors will satisfy anyone who does n't quite know what the colour brown will quot work quot with vi 's current editor is david clark art director is anna utzon and interior design editor is matt page	10
1	this is one of my favorite magazines and the only magazine subscription i 've ever given as a gift my list of recipients should tell you a lot about for whom this magazine is appropriate i 've gifted the floss to my 73 year old retired grandma my 23 year old writer sister my 40 year old trivia buff co worker and my 15 year old high school sophomore cousin you might call me lazy for using one gift to knock off a good portion of my christmas list and you 're probably right but there 's something in mental floss for everybody i pick up a half dozen conversational nuggets each month i probably subscribe to 10 mags and i 'd say this is the one i actually read every month great stuff my highest recommendation	10
0	perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations but i was really disappointed with this recordthe songwriting is weak the singing is weak and the arrangements are dullsomething kicked all the life out of the music the songs are not all the same but for some reason they all sound the same and embarrassingly you can sing most of them after one listen they are so simplistic and cliched	10
1	i first saw this movie on satellite tv with my mom one winter vacation recently i was reminded of it and remembered how wonderful it is besides being an adorable story the film is shot beautifully in black and white which the dvd shows off perfectly i think it 's much better than you 've got mail although i like that movie too definitely worth at least a rental	10
1	i am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase the earrings were more beautiful than i expected i will definitely purchase jewelry from amazon in the future ! !	10
0	i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here i'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly they would get stuck about 2 3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand retract them very interestingly if the section right above the one i'm trying to expand retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens \( 18 55mm \) a less than 2 lbs combo which is much lighter than the 4 4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly again it might have been a defective unit but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway i wanted to buy this from amazon it was n't in stock it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to 40 so i went elsewhere and got it for 30	10
1	the pliers do the job seem to be well made my only problem was the awkwardness in trying to align the link i guess if you remove the band from the watch it would make it easier in that case i recommend one of the pin removers that sit flat on a horizontal surface but this did do the job \( even leaving the band on the watch \) it comes with a smaller sized push pin that is a breeze to swap out	10
1	no way should children be playing this game it is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players the goals of harming people picking up hookers breaking the law can be a blast as long as everyone knows it 's just a fantasy many people go into the details so i 'll make this short have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts but there 's no way i would consider this game for anyone under 15 and then i would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy	10
0	this film was dreadful streisand is absolutely unlikeable to enjoy this film you would need to buy into the romance between streisand and nolte and i just ca n't see how that is possible i could n't believe it when i found out how critically acclaimed this film was along with the english patient this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed' films i have ever had the displeasure of viewing	10
1	this movie was made mainly to potray the cycle of jesus' christ life and what he when through sacrificing himself for our sins people may think that it may be too religous for their standards but everyone has their own beliefs i highly recommend you view the film it is very innovating and emotional being a christian myself everytime i watch this film it uplifts my spirits and i hope it will do the same with yours	10
0	my daughter just turned seven and we got these for her birthday because she loves to be outside she thought they were cool for a few days and now they are sitting in the garage we put the appropriate number of strings on for her weight \( 56 pounds \) but she does n't seem to bounce very high and she needs help getting them on she was upset because some neighbor boys made fun of her due to the fact that they are so big and awkward looking i would n't tell someone not to buy them but i wish i would have gotten something else for her	10

0	this seemed like a pretty slick idea and was a pretty clock all it needs to do is let us know that our stomachs are n't lying that it really is near lunch i set it near our front \( glass \) door and it apparently found a signal as it had changed time by itself and was spot on so i hung it in our office \( no window \) two days latter we had a thunderstorm one night apparently that can interfere with the signal rather than sit tight and wait for a fresh signal this thing was off by an odd amount of time like an hour and 27 min by the next morning i set it manually and today it 's off again by about an hour the instructions to reset which i got from tech support were not less than 7 steps long and included a detailed disertation on what type of battery and what it 's expiration should be man that 's a lot of work just to verify what my stomach knows is true for 25 and the packaging being gone this is in the dumpster i 'll get a regular clock that only keeps time to a couple of minutes a month but takes a month to show the error	10
1	case is pretty much what you see i have no complaints \) the case protects my camera very well	10
1	i'm only a little bit of a coffee nut but i really like this coffee my fiance 's father brought some back from costa rica while he was there on business i have just finished my bag and already miss it this was one of the best coffees i have tasted well balanced not too acidic not too bitter just right in my opinion it 's really good served traditionally hot but it 's also great iced and as with all coffees it 's best if you get whole bean and grind it yourself my opinion a must try	10
0	i bought this as a christmas present for my 4 year old daughter she is a huge my little pony fan ponyville lives in our house in fact we got it out and played with it for a couple hours we did n't have the problems described with the hand crank that seems to be very durable the problem is with the flower that zippee goes in a pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it after a couple hours the flower petals are now broken and ca n't be repaired toys certainly do n't have the quality in them that they used to hasbro 's quality in general has declined this was demonstrated in the newest my little pony castle as well this toy has some neat features the crank works well and the braiding mechanism is useful the breezie that lives in the flower goes along with the story in the my little pony video series the colors are vivid and bright i would have liked to suggest that the pink stage that the daffidazey stands on should have had built in storage to hold the hair accessories some additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this set 4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies' hair is a bit skimpy the braids are nice and tight and even a young child can operate this toy with a bit of assistance \( hint putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult assistance \)	10
0	i really like bruce campbell and his movies like army of darkness but this movie is not in the same league first of all the plot is slow and boring bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move this really hampers the action aspects of the movie the dialogue aspect is not much better if you like bruce my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the tv episodes of jack of all trades episodes it is a lot more fun and has the real bruce	10
1	good enough for me but i like to tinker with things has been running continuously for over 3 years have replaced the batteries a few times they dont last forever but the power drain is reasonable it has survived 3 hurricanes none were a direct hit but it has recorded wind speeds of 83 mph after about 2 1 2 years of operation the anemometer stopped working knowing it was out of warranty i pried it open and found the magnet it uses to trigger the wind speed sensor had rusted and fallen out i glued another ring magnet in with 3m 5200 rtv \( killer stuff by the way \) and it is running like a champ this item is about to less than the oregon scientific wmr 968 and it comes with the software and cable you need to connect it to your pc it is a super deal you can spend to connecting your oregon scientific unit to your pc after setup and calibration all you need to send your weather data to the internet is a program called wuhu \( weather underground heavyweather updater \) and an account at weather underground check my weather at wunderground com station number kflrockl4 for the money i cant beat it i wish i had a davis but i cant justify the expense maybe when i win the lotto	10
0	okay i 'll admit i bought into the hype oooo no sulfates oooo essential water oooo all natural no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this vegan shampoo and conditioner i headed into the shower with confidence that i had finally dumped 35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair and what a difference it made the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely dessicant shampoo and no amount of the so called conditioner helped to right the wrong ! i tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results after 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than i was i returned the product this product truly deserves 0 stars ! !	10
1	i really like this kitchen gadget as it different actually useful and my hands smell less like garlic thus far i have only used it to chop herbs onions and garlic so i ca n't debunk the mush mess i would simply say do n't pull the cord a lot if you 're worried about it i bought about 5 and gave them all out as x mas gifts	10
0	too bad i did n't come here first at epinions nobody had the reset problem but i sure did it 's too bad too because this thing is a technological marval except it 's defective from the very start my water is somewhere between hard and soft but more to the soft side i read that using distilled or water with no mineral content will allow the boiler to boil less and therefore not trip the automatic shutoff i now quote from the review of a sunbeam on this site a vaporizer only works well if the mineral content in your water is ideal so you may have to make simple adjustments if the water does n't boil \( add salt \) or if it boils too rapidly \( add distilled water \) this will prevent spurting boiling over and overheated reservoirs the problem is it is ridiculous to buy a water distiller for a unit that already has a good filter in it already ! the unit boils like the bejesus on low putting it on high pushes it over the edge and it shuts off with the red blinking reset refill light i tried 4 times and even called tech support \( they were pretty clueless are you listening bionaire \? \) it 's really a pity too because the humidistat can be placed away from the unit and it wirelessly communicates to make sure the room is evenly humidified i think the problem is that the water does not go high enough in the tray and you ca n't tilt it to fix the problem \( most warm mist are designed that way for some reason	10

0	my one year old and i love these blocks they are light soft and provide endless opportunity for imagination however they are extremely expensive and of inferior quality construction when we opened the box we found that several of the blocks were not cut along a straight edge making them difficult to stack also several of the identical shape blocks were not exactly the same size leading to stacking problems one of the blocks was peeling in one corner these blocks are such a great idea i find it hard to believe no other companies are making them	10

0	this headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine you can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you as for the performance it is great i drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and i can hear them just fine also the volume is great and at times i have to turn it down in volume have tried the anycomhs 890 and this outperforms it hands down have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the anycom would at any time i would definitely reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment very satisified with the performance tried to change the rating and seems like ca n't do that once the review is written amazon needs to fix the edit system on this	10
1	this is a better stroller than the other three \( all for one child \) strollers we have very maneuverable and adjustable it turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently folds down very quickly it 's great that the kids can sit next to each other	10
0	i was very impressed with the infomercials on this product and was about to buy the set before i read a very detailed and thorough online review at http www epinions com content 180924944004 the reviewer gives a blow by blow review challenging all the claims made by the commercial for this product among her pet peeves things do stick to the product use a flour cooking spray for better results odors do stay with the product not easy to clean the reviewer says she found a special plastic cleaning product helps size of the pieces are small the pieces are so flexible that if you do n't place the food neatly in the pan you get some unexpected lumps or misshapened results you can slice through the product easily guarantee is shakey at best and so on there are one or two pluses but not enough to warrant buying in the face of all the negative issues brought to light and more importantly i personally wonder how safe it is to cook food on silicon surfaces at high tempertures on a day to day basis i for one definitely will not buy this product please consider this recap of another 's review a public service buyer beware	10

0	i would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine is n't worthy of its title i subscribed before reading review i was hoping to find an affordable psychology based read though some stories are interesting i'm sure i 'd be able to find them in other magazines like vogue or cosmo and there is plenty of ads probably more than stories and much like other reviewers when i first ordered it it took forever for the first issue to arrive now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course	10
1	i just ordered this item from amazon to be used on my 1995 dodge neon however i have been searching in product description what 's in the box and have noted that the actron cp9135 comes with a cd software but thecp9135 do not have any visible pc \( serial rs232 \) conector it is true that this actron cp9135 is firmware upgradeable anyone knows how to connect and perform this upgrade \? thanks in advance	10
0	i did n't read in the instructions that i was also buying a dancing partner this thing just will not stay still i tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors but the water weight just is n't enough to keep it still power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket if i lived in an apartment my neighbors would hate me the water ends up around 200lbs \( when full \) and just does n't do the trick i have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water as for springiness you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it \( by moving across the floor \) but in my opinion it 's too springy there is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag it definitely needs a tension adjustment i 'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control i would n't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power hitting	10
0	i think its not wise to refer to only one source here is one of the testmonies i was born in israel \( palestine then \) to a well known jewish religious family we are living in israel for many generations well before the zionists infiltrated the middle east jews and moslems always lived in peace in palestine until the zionists came from europe massacred the palestinians \( dir yassin etc \) and forced them to run away from their lands and get locked into the refugee camps across the borders for almost three generations studying in a jewish religious school in tel aviv i was taught that the 'bad arabs' conducted pogroms all over palestine killing jews my family told me the opposite we lived in palestine in peace for generations with our moslem brothers when the zionists started their pogroms \( dir yassin \) the moslem acted in revenge and started their own pogroms killing jews however our moslem friends actually saved the lives of our family by hiding us in their own houses at a risk to their own lives http www rense com general54 thank htmyou can make your search with many of the anti zionism jewish organization all over the world	10
1	the trilogy just stunned me and i worked at trying to understand its complexities then i read this book and everything made sense at first i declared that the trilogy was better than 'the lord of the rings' but could not explain why this book nails it it will be wonderful if you read the trilogy read this book and share everything with your children remember when 'expanding your consciousness' was all the rage \? no \? that 's ok all these books do it with a basis in science buy the darn books buy them for your friends	10
0	this movie was awful that 's all i can say about it it killed the book which happens to be one of my favorites when i got this movie after reading the book i excitedly stuck it in my vcr \( yes vcr no affordable dvd players at the time \) i was expecting so much more than what i received i know movies have to cut out a lot from the books to fit them into 2 hours but i 've never before seen a movie cut out the main hero ! now that 's just ridiculous ! if i were the author david baldacci i would be furious that my story had been so badly butchered clint eastwood had to be the star so he twisted the whole plot around to make luther whitney the hero when in the book luther whitney is gunned down half way though in the movie the book 's hero jack graham is totally non existent my advice to you if you 're looking to buy a good movie look someplace else read the book sigh if only the movie would 've followed the book a little more closely it might have been a blockbuster hit too bad	10
1	this is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of african americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of l a as you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends you truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born ice cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal from fights on the corner to drive by shootings this movie truly captures the struggle millions of african americans go through as we watch the kids grow up in the ghetto to when they are old enough to get out they still seem to be the same their customs dont change simply because of their surrounding guns liquor poverty and crime they have no other option than do join in when dough boy 's \( ice cube \) brother ricky is offered a scholarship to play college football it looks like a way to get out of the ghetto the whole family feels as this a way for them to escape it also so everyone is supporting him until a tragedy is brought upon the family this story truly proves nothings good until finally out of the hood for these boys	10
1	the digital rebel is the most amazing camera i 've ever owned my previous camera was a canon a90 and i loved using all the features on it great camera ! i decided recently that maybe i should graduate to a slr because i was starting to get more creative with my photography i spent a great deal of time researching cameras and finally decided on the digital rebel after a few months of owning it i still am amazed the image quality is fantastic it 's quick and responsive and every day using it i learn a little more it 's the perfect intro slr camera for me because everything makes sense and it 's easy to learn i 've gotten amazing shots that i could never dream of getting with a point and shoot if you are finding yourself wanting a little more than a point and shoot go for this camera you wont be sorry	10

1	though only a fraction of books have been written about the great war when compared to wwii there are some great ones to pick from for instance for a great narrative of the american involvement in world war i try the doughboys by gary mead for a good look at the events of gallipoli just last year john laffin wrote the agony of gallipoli which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare there is a great book which chronicles verdun called the price of glory by alistair horne the list goes on and on whether it be flanders the somme passchendaele africa jutland whatever your area of interest might be the point i'm making is there are plenty of specialized accounts of world war i and even several overviews of the war but john keegan 's the first world war is a great source for an overall study of the war this book covers it all in brief detail accounts are given on virtually every facet of the war and even some of the best insight available for the events which led up to the war itself every aspect of the war is given its due diligence here i 've never been a big fan of keegan his writing to me is a struggle at times this book is no exception it reads somewhat like a 500 page textbook and borders on tedious at times but as much as i dislike his stuffy british writing style he is a virtual historical genius his knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted and he writes for the most part without imparting his own commentary in fact without prior knowledge one would hardly surmise that keegan is himself british the big exception to that is keegan 's typically british hard line stance of not giving the american forces their just dues in this aspect he even contradicts himself in several places he goes to great length to illustrate to the reader that in the early months of 1918 germany was still very much capable of winning the war the western front had been bolstered by the arrival of german troops from the now defunct eastern front the new soldiers from the east brought with them battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph as they had in the east he goes on to tell of how effective german advances had been in early april advancing a fifty mile wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days he then follows this sort of information with telling the reader how though ambitious and courageous the american forces were largely inconsequential to the conclusion of the war when he does acknowledge american victory it is quickly followed with excuses for the german forces that said if you 're seeking information about just how american forces rallied to bring an end to over four years of war in a matter of a few months this book will infuriate you however if you are looking for a good overview of the war as a whole this is one of the best out there i should add the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section for further study monty rainey	10
1	this is a great case ! i have a motorola v180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes did n't line up because this is a flip phone most cases move when you open and shut the phone covering speakers etc this case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement when you open and close the phone does n't affect the placement of the holes etc in the case also the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent	10

1	the mirror and its attachment is better than the ones i have purchased however the attachment does not addapt to all helmets i have two helmets by specialized one i had no problem attaching to the other the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly it would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets this would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment whether or not you print this review does not matter to me this review is intended for your design department thanks for the mirror	10
1	this case is the perfect size to hold our sony camcorder and a few blank tapes we purchased it for a cruise because we wanted to carry on the camcorder and have it protected but not have to lug the large case we owned that holds all the accessories this smaller case still protects the camera and allows room for some extras	10
1	this is a great sized foot bath i pour hot water in it sit back and relax it does n't keep the water warm but if i start off with really hot water it stays warm until i'm ready to get out using the pedicure attachements is hard work though i just assume use a hand held brush the bubble feature is too loud to use while watching tv still for the price i like this foot bath i 've even given it as a gift	10

1	my youngest daughter has had mild to severe asthma for 32 years and has had to use an inhaler almost on a daily basis i bought her this product to use in her new house as she was having severe asthma attacks from dust mold pollen ect she has been using this product for three \( 3 \) months now and she has not had to use her inhaler a single time we have used several other brands and types of air cleaners in the past twenty years but none have proven as effective as this product highly recommeded	10

1	flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now but even if you buy the sugar free kind you 're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer as if that were n't bad enough it 's partially hydrogenated ! splenda flavor blends is a wonderful alternative if you 're like me and just ca n't face black coffee please note that this is not a creamer it sweetens flavors coffee if you find you just have to have creamer to tame down your coffee you can add a splenda flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy buy some powdered non fat milk and add that along with the splenda flavor blends lots of times i find products with splenda already in them to be too sweet but i did n't think that was the case with this all three of the available flavors \( hazelnut mocha vanilla \) taste great without being overpowering finally now i can kick that fatty creamer bad habit !	10

1	i bought the x lander because i am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when i needed it the watch is well designed and of good quality a few things did disappoint me but i think they are outweighed by the features however it appears that it does not have a second time zone why they would not include this is beyond me as a pilot i want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format a traveler would want time here and at home it is not there but is on other models they offer the dial is not the easiest to read and i had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs meters and celsius vs farenheit the display needs to be more vivid the company does offer a white face with black numerals which might be better it is a nice watch but not the greatest execution of the concept especially for 300	10
1	into the blue turned out to be a decent movie i was not expecting a story or anything from this movie other than pure eye candy i was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography the underwater shots are really breathtaking i also enjoyed the special features on the dvd which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested of course aside from the beautiful underwater photography there are the movies stars who are some of the most beautiful people in the world jessica alba looks incredible ashley scott is also gorgeous and for the ladies there 's paul walker and tyson beckford i was n't expecting much from this film but i was pleasantly surprised it 's not going to win any academy awards but it is entertaining and fun	10
1	this is my favorite wash to use on my car it suds extremely well holds the suds well and the smell of it is quite pleasant i was tired of car washes that would develop suds effectively but only hold them for a few minutes leaving you with a bucket of dirty water obviously not too good for your car ! with meguiar 's nxt everytime i finish washing my car the bucket is still full of bubbles i highly recommend this product	10

0	gonzalo is a fantastic pianist this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side however it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments if driving later in the day i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste but it is exciting not here there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well now some will like the gentleness i suppose but with weak material and not much diversity it sits pretty flat with me	10

0	back in the early 90 's jane march made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit the lover granted the role did n't give her much to work with but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers including me the movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring board into a legitimate movie career unfortunately choosing the unbelievably stupid bruce willis vehicle color of night as her follow up probably killed any chance at a career that she had i 've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre most of the ones that i 've seen while sexually explicit are n't really erotic nor are they thrilling in any way this movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of basic instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar as a result we ended up with some terrible films like sliver jade body of evidence and this film color of night the plot goes something like this bruce willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window going splat on the sidewalk below he is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red \( ! \) he decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by scott bakula and hanging out with scott 's therapy group he hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened scott 's group is a motley crew of screwed up people from a woman who is nymphomaniac to a weird androgynous young boy bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable jane march and he quickly falls in love with her we get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool the bedroom the bathtub and the shower meanwhile someone murders scott bakula and starts to wreck havoc with bruce he tries to figure out if it 's someone in scott 's therapy group and on and on and so forth the movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious bruce willis was apparently taking this movie virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances but bruce seemed to think that this might be an oscar contender add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension and add way too many red herrings and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch about the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit but decidedly unerotic sex scenes they really come across as more silly than anything else the only thing that i enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older jane march in the buff and looking better than ever what a smoking body ! but like i mentioned before she got a lot of the blame along with bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result she has appeared in very few movies since i still think that if she had been given the proper chance she could have been a great actress but people have all but forgotten about her by now it 's really surprising that this movie did n't kill bruce willis' career but i guess if he could survive hudson hawk bonfire of the vanities he could survive anything btw the version i watched was listed as being the r rated director 's cut with 17 additional steamy minutes added back into the film since i never saw the original cut i could n't tell what might have been added back into this version there is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal bruce willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that 's too strong avoid this movie like it was herpes color of night is rated r and contains strong sexual content nudity graphic violence and strong language	10

1	victor hugo 's enormous output is unique in french literature he was described as 'the most powerful mind of the romantic movement' and his novel published in 1862 continued to be widely read the plot that of a detective is as well the epic of the people of paris its author claimed it as a 'religious' work and indeed by means of its characters sometimes a little larger than life yet always vital and engaging and by its re creation of the swarming parisian underworld the main theme of man 's ceaseless combat with evil clearly emerges while the whole gives a faithful picture of the declines and flow of life hugo relives his youth in this vast novel the culmination of 14 years work he and valjean share their most outstanding characteristic their charitable heart the story contains glimpses of hugo 's disgust towards 'the treatment of the lower class french citizens by the government valjean an ex convict recently released from prison but he is not given the opportunity to make a good living for himself fantine forced into prostitution due to the lack of money to pay her illegitimate child and towards the 'general injustice of the law enforcement system valjean sentenced to prison for stealing a loaf of bread fantine arrested for hitting a man of a higher class the symbol of france 's greed that hugo despises is thenardier the man that fantine entrusts cosette to who betrays the trust by essentially making cosette his personal slave the strongest emotions of les mis rables are love and hate javert and valjean are both extremes with a conscience incredibly strict liam neeson is cast as the gentle valjean who takes the twist of fate parlaying it into personal success and moral rehabilitation he changes his ways to become years later the much loved mayor of vigau and as a caring businessman he struggles to forget the past and manages to redeem his soul becoming benevolent giving manual and financial help to the weak sick and poor after nine years valjean was horrified to discover that javert a former guard of the quarries of toulon where he served almost 20 years has arrived to be the head of vigau 's police force valjean 's desire to protect the employees from bad influences leads him to fire \( indirectly \) one of his workers fantine turned prostitute he assumes responsibility for raising her daughter cosette he becomes a father figure and soon forces the choice of sacrificing his own freedom for her happiness geoffrey rush plays the icy chief inspector javert the man who tries to live his life without breaking a single rule when he is given the job of spying in the barricades and valjean gives him his freedom instead of shooting him things begin to fall apart for him the action of mercy of jean valjean causes him to doubt the solid base of his existence he is in emotional agony unable to betray his convictions he sees too late the truth valjean 's legendary physical strength are enough to stir his suspicion that the town mayor is a fraud he is less villain than a man driven by his own hard concept of justice begging permission of his superiors in paris to investigate the mayor the man he believes is a convict when he thinks he has made a mistake in identifying monsieur le maire as the 'convict' jean valjean he insists on informing him that he has denounced him unjustly and that therefore he must be dismissed you must punish me he says or my life will have been meaningless \( a key line in the film \) uma thurman approaches the self indulgent character of fantine with admirable restraint giving a certain level of charm and charisma to the film she gives her sick mother role a good amount of realism demonstrating her character 's frustration and pain exquisitely fantine 's misery overwhelms her as she sells her body to support her child being in a wild state enraged at how she is a helpless victim of misery she is arrested after being humiliated by several would be customers but valjean intercedes on her behalf overriding javert 's authority when valjean helps her she begins to rediscover hope her joy at the thought of having cosette with her is great but the shock of valjean 's arrest and the discover that cosette is not there are too much for the poor creature claire danes plays the teenage cosette who realizes one day that she has become quite beautiful she disobeys her father 's rules by secretly sneaking out and seeing marius a charismatic young parisian revolutionary with whom she fell in love cosette spends her childhood as a servant girl at the thenardier 's inn horribly mistreated and constantly terrified she grew up in a convent innocent pure and a bit na ve peter vaughan is excellent as the compassionate bishop whose act of generosity turns an embittered valjean around bille august tries to capture the essence of hugo 's morality staging its political turmoil strongly enough to give it contemporary resonance keeping the eternal three elements the bishop handing over the candlesticks fantine 's collapse marius crying out to the barricades ! history does n't change as voltaire once remarked but what we need from it does valjean 's story is not unique it 's universal in other world it 's contemporary there are certainly enough les mis rables to go all around the world	10
1	this is beautiful birdbath if placed on solid ground \( walkway concrete \) it will be great however if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom a wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip however it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright i am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch	10
0	okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season 1 episodes 2 4 5 6 and 7 ! ! ! 1 3 8 9 and 10 were the only ones that were 100 complete for me	10
0	such great visuals and i love most of the star wars rpg shooters but i cant believe this is a point and click game i was hoping kotor2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill the days of boulder 's gate point n click should be over but i guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay still a good game but dissapointed	10
0	i only had it for a few hours and after that i knew i would be returning it its video quality is quite horrible just better than a videophone and average of a webcam i should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive but honestly i prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is it 's quality will not be any better unless your outside and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun this would not do you basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow this also is a pain for mac users it says it 's able to import files and yes it can but in asf format now you can play it in vlc but think you 'll be able to convert it think again it converts just fine except without audio i 've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio so mac users pick something else it is being returned for certain	10

1	have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities do purchase the 50 mm 200mm telephoto zoom lens for the price it is a nice lens i tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor 's roof using 200 mm telephoto when you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name ! without the image stabilizer it is a blur i did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting without image stabilizer the title is blurred with the image stabilizer it is sharp a very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save or use filters to make them bw soft more bright or with different color tones people report that under tungsten light the auto setting gives a yellow tone without flash this is true however you can use the p mode which is like an auto mode reset white balance easily to tungsten light and the picture comes out nice ! great low light capabilities with image stabilizer if you are into action photography this may not be the camera for you it has limited ability to store a sequence of photos without a delay other camers react faster and have larger capacity do reset default from bright to natural tone you can do this in some modes but not all read the manual it really will empower you with many nice capabilities newer lenses are light and small and interface with image stabilization system automatically	10

0	i had searched high and low via the internet trying to find the perfect baby doll pram good quality material well made and if possible fold away storage ability when i found the corolle pram carriage i thought i found it plus the added bonus of a adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand daughter was she could push her babies but when it arrived i was not thrilled what looked good on paper was not so in life true it folds away to store in a closet no problem but this ability is to easy and i fear the child will pinch her fingers all that keeps the stroller in an up right position in 2 lame flip over metal rings now with the wonderful way a simple umbrella stroller for a real baby folds way why was n't this technology used on this product sure an adult would have to fold it up but i would feel better if that was the case then a 4 year old maybe getting broken fingers also the cute canopy it does not stay on if you even move it to open a tiny bit i spent 113 00 on this item thinking i was getting a well put together item that would last years for my grand daughter only way that will happen is if i can weld parts together and forget about ever wanting to store it i did not buy this from amazon only cause i wanted it right away and so bought it from another shop but i knew amazon would have this forum and wanted to make sure others did not waste their money on this product go with the other one for 33 at least maybe it will stay together now i have to hope i can return this thing to where i bought it but i think corolle should either rethink this items design or just pull it from the stores it 's not what a good parent would want for their child thanks i hoped this helped	10

1	on one hand this cd is a straight ahead instrumental rocker but johnny a really shows how great he is with ballads such as his covers of wichita lineman and yes it is in fact those two ballads alone are worth the price of the cd by themselves but johnny a can flat kick your ass too he 's a biker and his tunes like oh yeah in the wind and two wheel horse are named for his other hobby and they rock but there 's nothing cliched or tired in his style he always seems to be looking for new ways to say something i saw him in person at the triple door in seattle sometime in february 2005 in a power trio format and he played most of the tunes on this album the guy is one amazing guitar player he played his signature gibson hollow body fitted with a vibrato tailpiece \( bigsby \? it was like the old chet atkins country gentleman model \) and he utilized a battery of foot pedal effects coming eventually through a pair of marshall combo amps the guy had some of the best clean tones i 've ever heard from anyone anywhere basically johnny a is a guitarist who has complete command of the instrument and he 's got a rocking soul that cuts loose on originals and covers alike in a style that 's all his own and that 's saying something these days if you love great rocking rockabilly guitar combined with really cool ballad playing in the power trio format this cd is just what you 're looking for in fact i guarantee you 'll be knocked out five stars	10
0	i 've used omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf nothing really fancy two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables using this software was a nightmare the ocr worked better than the previous version but it showed mixed fonts on the page \( two column text w a title about 1 3 down and above the text \) no problem i thought i 'll just use the wysiwyg \( what you see if what you get \) text editor to fix this it looks very nice w some good features well wysiyg is more like wysiwydon'tget i 'd fix the fonts save the file open it in adobe reader and find that omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts size and the titles i tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines \( each w text followed by a page number \) no go plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into 'replace text' mode while i was trying to insert text and i could n't get out in frustration i used a friends machine w abby finereader 7 0 pro what a welcome change ocr was at least as fast and accurate and the editor while not as feature laden as omnipages actually worked ! i did in 6 hrs what i 'd been trying for well over 12 to do in omnipage and that was w o going thru any of the tutorial info just loaded it and started i'm buying abby for my next project they 've upgraded to 8 0 and i 'll bet it 's editor delivers what omnipage only promises i would n't recommend omnipage 15 pro to anyone	10
1	i bought this toy for my daughter almost a year ago now she still plays with it all the time it is by far her fav toy the only problem is that it 's a bit too load and no way to turn it down or off well besides that it is a perfect toy for small kids my daughter is almost 4 and still is not tired of it	11
1	i got this as a recommendation from a friend and i found this to taste really wonderful it comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon i enjoy drinking matcha teas in the late afternoon to help me relax and this is the best matcha i have tasted if you 'd like to get wild sometimes i like to sprinkle the matcha powder on top of some vanilla ice cream and it makes a great dessert treat	11
0	i bought this for my 8 year old daughter to begin learning about digital photography it has been nothing but a headache from day one we have yet to be able to download any pictures all of the endless number of pictures she has taken have been erased before we can download them the one button mode is very confusing and the directions although written in english seem to be in a foreign language the directions say do not return to the store if you are having difficulties you are suppose to call the phone but good luck getting through i 've tried for 2 days straight they apparently are experiencing high call volume from all the other unhappy customers who were fooled into buying this educational camera as i am shopping for another camera i will not buy anything from the company who manufactured this camera sakar	11

1	this disc is pure gold ! featuring a full live performance from their 2004 european tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate stray cats fan collectible ! the concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80 's they show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show they go through all their classics and then some whether it 's stray cat strut gene and eddie or rumble in brighton what you see and hear on this disc is flawless must buy for all music fans not just fans of the cats	11
0	had long looked forward to finally reading this acclaimed novel there are brilliant and imaginative highlights in the book although finding those bits is like looking for light in a black hole a lot of work for very little result i truly believe this is a book that would be more interesting if one increased their medication level way past the recommended daily dosage mark	11

1	this pur minerals starter kit is a great introduction to this brand i am absolutely in love with the 4 in 1 pressed mineral makeup \( included in the kit \) it 's so much better than the bare escentuals makeup which i had been using for years the 4 in 1 provides great coverage as it is a foundation concealer and spf 15 pressed powder all in one with bare escentuals i was having to buy the mineral veil foundation and concealer all separately and i still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well pur minerals is a wonderful makeup very lightweight and even the brush is soft on my skin ! i highly recommend it	11

1	this is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of american foreign policy a year after this book was published there were over a hundred reviews regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author finds the author right or wrong interesting or boring this book is one of the most influential books if not the most influential book that affected american foreign policy in fact the current bush adminstration 's policies george kenan 's containment henry kissinger 's policies as well as countless adminstration 's policies are shaped or affected by this book my area of study is the foreign policy of post world war two american governments and never have i understood it with greater clarity after i read this book it is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations differing on extent \( i studied the policies first and read the book the year after \) it is a fascinating book and hard to put down the author writes in a european style \( beautiful long sentences etc \) which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co students makes it more difficut to read he tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically ms rice and mr kissinger were heavily influenced by this book to understand them this is a must read in and of itself it is an excellent book a classic and thousands others significantly more qualified than i have reviewed it look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists	11
0	my 10 mo old son showed no particular interest in this table i did not like it much either why would a 10 mo old show any interest in table items that sing \? i have left it without legs two minutes after i installed the legs my son nearly fell with the table on his face had to uninstall them not good for active infants also not very entertaining buy the one from leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this \( might have more balance though but i do not know for sure \)	11
1	every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it pretty infuriating especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it yes you can always remove those on photoshop \( or cheaper yet the gimp \) but is n't it cool when you look at a picture and say that is it nothing to do on it ! \? \? and it was n't just the sky any off white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly from the acursed specks with this blower greatly priced \( pity that adorama does n't have free shipping though \) i put my camera on the tripod pointed it down squirted three or four times and gone are the specs ! ! ! great buy for dslr owners	11

0	i 've found the befsx41 \( v2 0 \) to be very problematic with firmware version 1 50 18 some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes bringing down the entire net with the newer firmware version 1 52 10 it fixes this problem but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server \( passthru tcp port 80 \) making the router totally unusable tech support was friendly and helpful and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1 50 18 for our websites and upgrade each time to 1 52 10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking so now we upgrade downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week and each time we do it brings down our net i 've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands you cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its mac address instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips also it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number even though they map to two different computers this makes it impossible for example to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time	11
1	this is a great feel good movie but hollywood altered the story for theatricality in the film a group of students who are having difficulties with simple fractions are brought up in one year to become calculus winners there is a good backgroud article at http reason com 0207 fe jj stand shtmlthat describes how the process took ten years so that the original group of future burger flipping students were not the ones who passed the ap calculus exam jaime escalante \( played by edward james olmos of miami vice fame \) actually built up the system of excellence one grade at a time reaching back to the junior high school that fed garfield high the way that the movie was done however allows the viewers to see some of the decision making processes that the students went through in understanding that they could achieve and did have a chance in life to be more than others around them especially their parents remarkably at one point there were as many as 400 students enrolled in math enrichment classes under escalante 's leadership that 's 400 fewer future employees for kfc and macdonald 's \( as escalante said in one of his taunts to a reluctant student so tough guys do n't do math tough guys deep fry chicken for a living \? \) eventually it appears that the education establishment won out driving the brilliant teacher out and sending the kids back to a guaranteed failed future the idea is great that no student should be regarded as hopeless and that all should be encouraged to try but obviously there is a lot more work involved in that goal than this movie shows	11

0	there is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw the ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side so the open knife is not away from the set of keys this is the first swiss army knife i have ever come across with this flaw so alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo ! !	11
1	works great bought for making candle tarts and it did n't let me down i would recommend this hot plate for any use	11
1	this product is a masterpiece it 's a testimony to early 21st century thinking about the world the earth learning and software it 's a swiss army knife of information with a kind of practical beauty that we associate with tools that work check out the map tool and the view of the earth at night it 's delight and a gift to an active mind somebody has thought long and hard about what students need on their computer to succeed what they 've come up with is an awesome collection of innovative productivity tools for kids take math the math tool alone is worth the price of admission this is where algebra class should start math lovers will eat it up for the less than loving student includes really excellent tutorials on math concepts it even links homework help for many of the major math books you put in the textbook the assignment and it steps the student through the problems homeschooling \? read no further just buy it geography \? the map tool especially the statistical mapper lets you view the world from outer space with or without political boundaries and compares the performance of countries on a zillion measures literature \? it 's got summaries and readers guides for a huge list of required reading and not just the stuffy victorian novels but ursula leguin and even some titles that i did n't think were worth reading the language tools you can hear a word pronounced in a surprising array of foreign languages plus dictionaries and translators and even plugins for ms word that make it easy to write in french or spanish no more funny key combos to get a cedilla plus encarta encyclopedia which is safer and way more effective at leading kids to track down related ideas than a web search i'm sure i'm leaving something out the only problem is it takes gigabytes of memory and really ought to be partnered with ms office that said if you take education seriously you ought to have this on your computer	11

0	after my nextel phone started acting up i decided to switch services because i liked the razr style and a lot of people i was calling were already on verizon so the in calling was a bonus i have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my motorola i860 you can import only a couple of mp3s before the phones memory is full unless you buy their 50 transflash card \( 1 gig is the largest \) then you cannot assign the mp3s you import as ringtones either a major disappointment for me again missing my i860 with its 400 ringtones that i imported from random wav midi and mp3 files you cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events \( you have to set a reminder for all there is no option for no reminder \) all in all not what i grew accustomed to with my i860 i'm already thinking the 175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what i will spend over the life of my 2 year contract and that leads me to another rip off with verizon they charge you an extra 35 to sign only a one year term ! next time i 'll read the fine print and just upgrade my nextel	11
1	the rosetta stone language software was a great investment the product provides learning words together with listening seeing and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases it provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace the product has been worth it 's hefty price i do recommend purchasing a german english dictionary to accompany the software i have also had in the past a basic german 101 course prior to using rosetta stone so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the german language such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings	11

0	i purchased this software thinking that i could take my digital images create a slide show with music and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch unfortunately the disk that i got gave me some error messages that when i called tech support \( one hour hold time \) they told me that my error message meant that i could create files but they 'll only run on my computer not on my tv dvd player in addition you need to buy additional dvd burning software because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the microsoft logo on them \( the package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player \) so i asked for my money back however since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out they refused a refund	11

0	we looked for a trash truck that our 4 year old boy could play with on the surface the bruder looked the part not as cartoon looking as some the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice actual play testing though shows this product is n't very well built at least not enough to withstand normal wear and tear this truck was n't subjected to being thrown down the stairs jumped on etc it 's been just played with but it started coming apart quickly the hinged door in the back of the truck is a poor design the plastic hinges on the truck are too thin and break easily the plastic hinges on the door start to bend after multiple open closes and the plastic weakens and breaks off the hinged front compartment and rear sections are difficult to operate and stick easily items put into the cab \( like the essential green army man who drives the truck \) easily get caught in here and are very difficult to remove worse though is the key point of this toy the ability to latch the trash can to the lifting dumping mechanism this is way to complex for a child and the intricacy in getting a solid connect is difficult even for an adult if it 's not hooked up right the can falls off when you try to lift it very frustrating some little pieces \( rear view mirror etc \) broke off easily and early on but we kind of expected this the parts were simply too small and fragile to last long i do n't hold this part against the design part of the attraction was that it looked like a real truck and i do n't think there 's an easy way to add small details without some fragility while this is orignally was one of my sons favorite toys he ca n't really play with it the way he 'd like to while he still enjoys driving it around the house he ca n't pick up the trash and dump it without an adults help and that 's a shame for the price i expected so much more	11

0	okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox ! i selected the first 10 episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality ! so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season 1 episodes 2 4 5 6 and 7 ! ! ! 1 3 8 9 and 10 were the only ones that were 100 complete for me	11

1	i have recently bought this pair of earing and the matching bracelet for my son 's care giver when it arrived my sisters and i were tempted to keep them for ourselves they were lovely i particularly like the make and the feel of the bracelet they are what i would term fun pieces but not in the least suggesting that they are for younger persons only i am in my 40s and would enjoy wearing these pieces it was a good buy at the sale price oddly enough i also liked the packaging the items came in a regular protective brown cardboard box that protected the little gift boxes on the inside	11
1	i bought this sweeper to sweep my basement carpet which is dark in color and shows every bit of fuzz it does a reasonable job cleaning transforming my carpet from does she ever vacuum \? to oh she must have vacuumed yesterday it does n't get all the fuzz and crumbs but it does what i 'd expect from a sweeper it is also much lighter than my vacuum so i'm much more likely to use it my three year old daughter enjoys using it too she insists on sweeping her own room \( i wo n't complain \) the main thing i 've learned is that because the handle slides together it will not consistently support the weight of the sweeper head this means that if you pick it up or suspend it by the top of the handle the sweeper will probably fall off so pick it up near the sweeper \( it stays together fine when actually sweeping	11

0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	11

0	this out of all the many versions of jane eyre has to be my least favorite granted samantha morton has a very adorable fairy elfin like face like mr rochesters description of her but her acting has no highs and lows she stands up to mr edwards a little too much giving really snappy answers seemingly no respect to her employer which is not fault of hers the writing of the script is bad and so the direction ciaran hinds is totally over the top he is so angry with no understanding his eyes are very lustful and at times crazed he is not at all like the character described in brontes epic book of a very sad and tortured man who falls hopelessly in love with the innocence and singular personality of earnest honest and yet strong sweet jane eyre that charlotte bronte brought so vividly to life with her classic words the over acting of both during the proposal scene is almost comical to me there is no love feeling or chemistry here between the two actors just lust he seems to be going through a middle age crises just eyeing up this young girl and she though supposedy a virgin she dos n't act like one plus this movie seems very rushed you can never get a good foot hold of the story especially during janes childhood i do also miss the gypsy scene that is omitted in many of these movies and was expertly done in the dalton clarke mini series which brought some brief light heartednes to an otherwise very dark story if you want to see great versions i highly rate the 1944 movie with orson wells though it is another abreviatd version that movie truly captured the spirit and feel it is moody dark and mysterious another is the fantastic timothy dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the brontes story dalton 's and clarkes acting is simply superbly sublime ! however if you are like me see them all and make your own decision they all have something to offer and most are entertaining	11
1	i ordered this for my dad for christmas i was worried that it would n't fit him because he is a large man but thought what the heck i 'll use it if he ca n't i opened the box and i was n't sure it looked like a sack of ropes then i began unfolding and unfolding and unfolding and before long the thing was stretched at least 14 feet across my kitchen the loops are just great and seem so strong the only drawback was its not very soft but i guess it would n't be all that sturdy made out of chenille would it now all i need to do is buy him a home depot giftcard so he can get so sturdy posts and hardware and he is set ! !	11
0	this product works great for draining your car 's crankcase oil it has a screen to catch the drain plug however the large diameter plastic lid that seals the unit after draining is a piece of crap you are supposed to tighten it down then open the small plug to drain the oil into another container for disposal the large lid has a single thread that if you turn a half inch too far makes no seal at all it falls off when you tip the unit to drain emptying two to three quarts of used oil on to your garage floor this is a product that needs a bit more engineering to work well	11

0	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage and recent years have only accelerated this trend in the 60s and 70s it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend \( originally it was considered quite conservative \) but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop culture fluff with little substance as for its being part of the liberal media this is inaccurate recent coverage of the \( 2004 \) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non person the first debate between john kerry and george w bush was not even covered except for one very brief article listing a few fact check points instead the cover story wa about new products and movies a kind of sharper image catalog lite time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u s election but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment the bias seems to be in favor of mr bush but it 's still mostly bland and superficial your money is better spent on the british magazine the economist which is far more substantive while its editorial viewpoint is conservative it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u s politics the economist also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a \( dare i say it \) fair and balanced approach to the news time can still be entertaining to read but i would n't take what they say too seriously they tend to bend with the political wind	11
1	this is without a doubt the best we have spent on a toy for our 7 year old son but it is n't a toy it 's a highly functional albeit inexpensive metal detector we 've had it now for 3 years and take it camping etc it will easily find something as small as a rusty staple and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1 4 inches down very good if you consider how small the detection coil is when camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes rusty nails and the occasional coin adjusting the sensitivity is trivial just hold it away from any metal and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector led just goes out other reviewer has noted that the three piece shaft breaks easily which happened on ours but a little duct tape goes a long way and this should n't stop you from buying one if you get one make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find ps it also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls	11

0	this magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous these ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine it seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness to the level of competition a recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women some of the women had body fat below 10 i'm trying to get mine below 30 it 's just a different fitness weightloss league completely i like magazines like fitness and shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice i can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese i ca n't drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch eat 10 servings of protein a day and pop potentially dangerous pills i am very disappointed with this magazine	11
1	recently i got into a more grown up field \( commercial real estate \) and decided i had to look the part i decided i needed a great watch to go with those new brooks brothers suits and got an invicta speedway at over a little more than a hundred bucks it was the greatest deal of my life i get compliments on it especially from women almost every single day several of my older colleagues mistook it for a rolex daytona and flipped when i told them the price i highly recommend it furthormore i have found that invicta is an amazing watch company to say the least around the same time i also bought the 8926 pro diver to use as my casual watch and also get endless compliments it is amazing that i got both of these watches for less money than a run of the mill seiko or citizen they will have have my money and compliments for years to come	11

0	with the 70 million that was spent on the 2005 video game inspired film doom you 'd think that director andrzej bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly on second thought given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of shoot the mutants it 's pretty clear that mr bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment as to the film 's plot it can be summarized in a single sentence a group of ber soldiers lead by their sarge \( played by the rock \) travel to mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh eating mutants after injecting a criminal with dna recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a martian archaeological dig so there 's tons of shooting a lot of screams gallons of fake blood guts being tossed about a martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small scale version of the sphere others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include karl urban \( ber soldier john grimm \) and rosamund pike \( as john grimm 's sister named sam \) why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in doom defies logic to anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1 star film in a theater you have my deepest sympathy to anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of doom on dvd please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price that alone should tell you how good this film is	11
0	this was my first cologne purchase it 's a really delicious scent complex and pleasant not overpowering give it 15 min to dry and mix with your skin it truly does smell different from the first spray i ca n't stop smelling myself i really love the smell my only complaint \( and it 's a biggy \) is that it does n't last for more than a few hours after two or three hours it 's completely gone except for a slight trace when i press my nose to my skin i 've tried spraying it on my body \( neck wrists \) and also my clothing and it just does n't last i feel the need to carry the bottle with me and reapply it every few hours but that 's not going to realistically happen it 's really disappointing since it 's so delicious	11
1	this book covers all the elements of game theory emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism the philosophical aspects are also given a thorough treatment the 8 appendices provide a more formal exposition of several key concepts such as the minmax theorem the geometry of equilibria and linear programming the book has not changed much since its publication in 1957 but it is by no means archaic even for those who have a modern and more rigorous textbook quot games and decisions quot is highly recommended as a supplement there is something for everyone in it	11
0	the good news is that it mostly works although the weather forecast is as advertised only about 75 accurate unfortunately it has some annoying flaws 1 \) although it will provide either 12 or 24 hr format and either celsius or fahrenheit temps you ca n't actually select the temperature display once you select 24 hr time format you get celsius temps whether you want them or not if you want deg f you must select 12 hr time 2 \) if you run the clock off batteries you have to press a button to get any projection unfortunately the button you press is the snooze button which activates both the projection and the backlight the button to control brightness of projection does not work in battery mode activating both lights simulaneously is both redundant and wasteful as it runs down the batteries more rapidly than necessary 3 \) worst of all the device emits a very annoying very audible high pitched whining sound any time any button is pressed \( including the snooze \) and anytime you need to set or reset anything 4 \) manual confusing information on website did not tell me anything i needed to know emailed support no acknowledgement although i eventually got a response it was n't remotely helpful and i had already given up on them and returned the device	11
0	damn there 's nothing remarkable about the second item on this dvd it 's your standard european made sexploitation film the wild wild world of jayne mansfield on the other hand is reprehensible it 's a hodge podge of vacation footage of mansfield clips from her movie project and material entirely unrelated to mansfield linked only by the voiceover and then after an hour or so of light hearted softcore buffoonery the movie cuts to her death spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large mostly empty mansion she has left behind this movie has the feel of something slapped together for the sole purpose of trading off a famous name after mansfield 's death this is exploitation in its worst form i found the sudden change in tone the large volume of non mansfield material and the sheer obsessiveness of the last twenty minutes disgusting in the extreme those looking for cheesy bad movies to enjoy or softcore porn to tittilate go elsewhere this one is not merely bad but evil	11

0	alright own up which idiots are responsible for the release of this musicals collection \? since when have pinky and island in the sun been musicals \? \? \? \? \? these two movies are hard hitting dramas with a similar inter racial relationships theme would someone please tell them that just because harry belafonte sings the title song over the credits this does not make island in the sun a musical i suppose in their book because shirley bassey sings the title song over the credits this makes goldfinger a musical too \? \? it makes me so mad that we have idiots in charge of releasing these great old movies who have no idea what they are doing it seems to be a case of oh just grab six movies off that shelf and lump them together if they do n't know which are the best titles to release in a certain set why do n't they ask someone who does know \?	11

1	he 's been in the rock business a long time serving as chief editor founder of bar bible review and archaeology odyssey he is also president of biblical archaeology society among many other ventures i 've read his understanding the dead sea scrolls which he mainly edited although he wrote a few articles himself this is a magazine of substance one i would love to have a subscription to the issue of july august 2004 has an interesting article interview that mr shanks orchestrated between elie wiesel and frank moore cross the subject being how they understood approached studied the bible from their perspective which their lifes' work ultimately revolves around one f m cross comes from a presbyterian academic background the other wiesel a jewish one frank moore cross contributed several articles to understanding the dead sea scrolls he was the only protestant to work on the scrolls among the original team of 7 other people six of whom were catholic clerics he is an expert in this field and i just love wiesel 's mind i love how he writes and thinks that one article i think is really illuminating showing how rich in teaching the bible is regardless of its many detractors or fumbling misinterpreters it is as i 've been taught in sunday school g d breathed it 's g d 's words it is a living text even if it contains mostly stories of people long since dead and gone elie wiesel says of it wherever you open it any page you know that you are in the presence of something that exists nowhere else the moral of the article is neither approach wiesel 's or cross' toward scripture is wrong it just simply reflects the richness the variety of the text	11

1	i started with the battery grip initially wanting the double battery availability having used a 35mm with a hand strap and already realizing the value of the stability of such a strap this was my second attraction for the purchase of the battery grip and last but not at all least is the ability to use shoot from the grip itself allowing full ease of rotation of the camera though i have never used the battery magazine that allows for the use of aa batteries having it offers a backup should the canon batteries need charging and i am in the heat of shooting i always travel with my charge and four aa batteries i would recommend this grip as a standard accessory for the eos 20d and eos 30 d one thought to consider once on the camera it increases the overall height creating challanges with some camera cases	11
0	i have to wonder what world what physical plane what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on \? or maybe they are full moon employees lol first of all the movie especially one of the earlier scenes was identical to the 80 's flick the unnamable which is also and hp lovecraft based flick the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit when he breaks out his cell well this was just hilarious it reminded me of the incredible hulk yes jeffrey combs is in it but his acting is cheesy as it can be hunt down the unnamable instead a much better movie	11

0	the setting of this film is in the late 70s just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the vcr and the subsequent explosion of pornographic vhs tapes burt reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be artistic in his craft heather graham plays his psycho starlet and mark wahlberg plays a porn star who is well let 's just say endowed wahlberg 's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of wahlberg 's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to john holmes although i do n't know if the film makers would admit as much at any rate he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his package this hubris leads to his un doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and lots of shady characters this sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie well it could have been but all the way through there seems to be something missing there are times the film seems to try and convey a message but i'm not really sure one thing i do know is that i quickly remembered why i 've never cared for wahlberg he has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt also i was expecting a lot more skin than what the film delivered given the context of the film one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women that 's simply not the case in the end however the biggest problem of this movie is n't wahlberg or the lack of nudity the difficulty is that it 's just plain boring i have more than a passing interest in the history of porn and yet this flick failed to grab me	11
1	this item is exactly as advertised well designed well made and heavy my only complaint \( and the reason for the 4 stars \) is that the chain is way to short i knew this when i ordered it so i had other arrangements made but a 26 or 28 chain would be much better in my opinion than a 20 great value for the money however	11

0	this movie is more dark comedy and trippy foreign bizarrovision film than dyed in the wool zombie fest if you were like me who is n't well versed in the foreign horror movie scene this movie was entertaining but not what i 'd consider something i 'd add to the library \( thanks netflix \) one thing i 've found with italian horror movies they spend alot of effort on visual trippery seems they want every italian movie to be an art film and this is no exception \( same goes for the argento films of the past \) its not a bad thing just a distinctive style that you either buy into or you do not an awful lot of strange things happen for no real apparrant reason \) a little bit of sex \( again in that erotic italian artsy style \) a bumbling mentally retarded sidekick and a whole lot of strange implausable things happening and then eventually the movie ends the story is definately more love story dark comedy its entertaining has a few minutes of zombie suspense but its almost wrong to call this a horror film because its really not	11

1	after reading the very positive reveiws of this late 90 's thriller i decided that it deserved at least a rental i must confess that i am glad that i happened to stumble upon this movie on amazon because it was everything that a horror movie should be the screenplay was very put together the plot setting were intriguing yet mysterious the killings \( or cinematography if you want to make it sound all fancy \) visuals are quite impressive for it 's 500 000 dollar budget now the only real complaint that i can say about the film is that the acting is horrid now dont get me wrong not all of the acting was that bad but i would be lying if i said that most of the actors were okay the truth is that most of them had very little experience and that made the film look all around quite a bit less professional and hard to look at as an elite horror film i think that if the producers would have known when they made the film that it would do so well and have such great reveiws and number of veiwers than they would have been more than willing to dish out the few extra bucks in order to have some more experienced actors i thought that david hewlett played david worth \( the architect \) acceptably and i also thought that nicky guadagni 's performance as helen halloway \( the doctor \) was pretty good other than those two i thought that the acting was very lightweight the guy that played quentin \( the cop \) was really bad which was quite a shame just because that characte had a big role in the film and was really important also i thought that they could have gotten a better and more experienced guy to play the role of the autistic boy \( or man it was some what hard to tell \) i know that i keep going on and on about the acting but i cant wonder away from the truth to much the concept and idea of the film was really quite brilliant the screnplay was brilliantly written and the story line meshed with extrodinary ease despite the acting i was heavily impressed and the film was overall very good grade b	11

1	here 's a good litmus test to show how good a book like breathing lessons is nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret there are no car chases explosions sex scenes \( barely even any kissing \) or exotic locations no one changes or has an epiphany almost nothing happens maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter in law but nothing changes at all to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull heck if someone told me the plot of this book i 'd think it was really dull too but i did n't want to put it down the reason is that maggie and ira are so well drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira that 's how real they seemed to me i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they do n't seem like characters acting their parts they seem like real people because of this even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days in all honesty what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i 've ever read about how to write a book this is purely a character driven novel with very little plot except for the death of maggie 's friend 's husband that gets the ball rolling everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie 's personality more than any artificially generated plot twists it 's hard for me to find any real faults with this book except for the lengthy flashback near the end that perhaps goes on too long some people may call this boring or dull but i would call it purely exceptional i loved this book and highly recommend it	11
0	the people who have mentioned aphex twin and four tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists if you liked the stone roses you will like this it 's not an 'electronic' album at all i 've ordered manitoba 's earlier cd after listening to the samples \( the reason for purchasing both these albums \) and i certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'up in flames' it 's funny i promised myself i would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading either that or dan snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years	11

1	regular godiva pieces are great but they 're still chocolate i actually dislike some regular godiva pieces \( truffles are too sweet and caramels are similar to see 's caramels \) but the g collection is fantstic the presentation is stunning from the packaging to the airbrushed pieces and the taste is incredible the original flavors gave me pause \( peanut butter and jelly \? \) but they work so so well and taste better than any chocolate i 've ever had each piece averages to 3 but every piece is way better than 3 of candy bars or ice cream most pieces are better than 12 desserts from 5 star restaurants so while the price seems extreme once you taste a piece you will understand that it so worth it a perfect gift for a discerning chocolate lover and for yourself	11

1	if someone asked me to choose one episode of quot maverick quot that superbly illustrates my favorite television series' strengths this might be it james garner 's fascinatingly complex character bret maverick is on full display and diane brewster as samantha crawford maverick 's primary female nemesis is introduced in this episode in all her slipperiness and duplicity in a plot that revolves around a new orleans riverboat gambling contest that hinges on an obscure poker rule of the day the principals later segue by stagecoach to a western town with a crooked casino where they encounter leo gordon as mike mccomb maverick 's strapping irish ally jodie foster 's character in the recent mel gibson movie version was based on samantha and ms brewster 's performance is a revelation forcing the viewer to bemoan the policy of that period preventing most television actors from moving into theatricals warners' unsung but mesmerizing stable of character actors are peppered throughout the show to good effect as is always the case with this series and this episode has a classic feel with lustrous lighting and photography and fascinatingly nuanced performances this is one to watch repeatedly and serves as a superior companion to the movie version	11
1	nine months ago i was hired to help turnaround a once successful business from day one i realized that this was a company without focus it 's one thing to define a problem another to find a solution haneberg 's book was a shot in the arm just one concept stop multitasking would have been a major breakthrough for my team and personally the idea of doing one great thing has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job this book immediately rose to the rank of three or four must read titles in my business library in the couple of months since i first read it \( and i 've re read it a couple of times \) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions we 're nailing deadlines we 're closing more sales we 're thinking more strategically across the board in a business and social environment that throws more at us day by day hour by hour this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago we 're all doing more with less and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities if it 's true as woody allen says that 98 of success is showing up then the other 2 is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there this is the manual for getting your business and your life where you want it to be	11

0	i bought leappad plus writing on impulse at the store wanting to help my son with writing phonics etc he used it a few times but i almost have to beg for him to use it and that 's sad i wish i would have gotten the original leappad or perhaps even the leapster for one thing the book does n't recognize all pencil movements a child could make an incorrect number or letter and it does n't seem that the leappad would recognize it also the child has to keep erasing over and over providing limited usage not only that there are only a few books published with leappad writing in mind and the exercises are repetitive \( e g writing the number 6 ten times \) i 've bought quite a few leappad books and quantum pad books for my son and he is just not interested after initial use i'm sure he 's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such but i think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store and they 're cheaper ! not only that leappad books are very short much shorter than workbooks you can buy considering that leappad books are usually around 15 a pop and that amazon does n't carry list them all and there is a very limited selection in stuff mart type stores \( at least that 's the case in my geographical area \) you may want to re consider investing in the leappad system	11

1	this is a great phone that i 've used for a year now i 'd like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique especially at its price mp3 player just get an adapter for the usb port \( a few bucks on ebay \) and you can plug in your stereo headphones too bad they have n't offered an update to the motorola digital audio player microsd slot you can take a microsd card put it into the included adapter and plug into an sd slot on your computer and copy mp3s \( you can take any mp3 and make it your ringtone cropping it will make it more effective \) 3gp videos \( animation looks great but the sound was slightly out of sync search the web for video converters to convert your content \) or pictures i love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them bluetooth i got an explorer 320 headset for 20 and it works great with it battery easily exchangeable easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one the battery life is n't very long so it 's good to have a spare battery they 're cheap video camera not high quality video but its something the old razr could n't do customization i love customization you can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypad and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone it even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features you can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique speakerphone works even when closed good for using automated phone menu systems and when you 're put on hold the speaker is loud and great for ringtones and mp3s the plastic may resonate at certain sounds though vibrating alert vibe then ring ! why does n't every phone have this \? \? it should be the default standard for all phones the vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket if you are one to show off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise be descreet and answer immediately as for what i do n't like i do n't care much for the motorola menu style i prefer sanyo and samsung interfaces the menu is the same as a razr or slvr all the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off i carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit i scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it would n't look half worn off all the great features is what keeps me from getting a samsung t509 or other more expensive phones this phone just has all the fee free features you could want	11

0	i wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country this retro designed one speed steel framed coaster braked comfort bike seemed to be the ideal choice when it arrived i pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it the first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are not included in the manual \( which seems to cover every bike but this one \) how hard could it be to write up instructions \( with tool specifications \) for each model they manufacture \? a one page flyer could have done the trick to further complicate matters some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes it turned out that i could n't complete the assembly because i could n't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment i had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly even the bike shop had problems with this bike because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires i watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand so that it would n't rub the tire when i got the bike home the first thing that i did was to adjust the seat to the correct height and take it out for a ride within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down the quick release handle ca n't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it \( i'm not that heavy \) chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height rather than try to dis assemble this and box it up to return it i will check to see if i can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height its too bad they could n't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment ! the points i do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame and tires that will work well for unpaved trails when i can finally ride this	11
1	less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor in like flint still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the bond films the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world 's women while replacing powerful males with surgically altered substitutes \( leading to perhaps the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be a disbelieving flint says an actor as president \? \) that is until a renegade zowie general \( steve inhat \) decides it 's his turn to take the reins of power the delightful lee j cobb is back as flint 's curmudgeonly boss cramden as are the secret agent 's posse of female admirers and tv 's batgirl yvonne craig even shows up as a russian ballerina in like flint feels more grown up than the previous film partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind and charging a premium for them are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows cross dressing and the bouncing sing a long ball only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth comment as it 's a staple of the genre meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort a no frills dvd	11
0	i remember when this ran on espn2 during the week between christmas new year 's back in 2000 i'm a huge fan of the microgenre of football movies but this one stays at the bottom of the barrel pettine sr seems like a class act worthy of the respect local legend high school football coaches deserve his son pettine jr coaches at the rival school but lacks the charisma to make this documentary work maybe the footage of him not seeming like a dolt did n't record right thus we have no reason to root for him or his program at the finale rather than having a bittersweet moment at the ending after the dad plays the head to head season finale against the son pettine jr seems kinda clueless giving the old guy a half hearted handshake so much for paternal respect love had the potential to be great w the setup but do n't let the glowing summary trick you there 's no emotional payoff to speak of for the last game football after all has driven grown men to tears on numerous occassions your time would be better spent watching brian 's song rudy or the nbc series friday night lights even reruns of mtv 's two a days about hoover of alabama would be superior if you prefer the doc reality tv style	11

0	there 's nothing quot universal quot about this product it 'll split lightweight stuff like cell phones but do n't trust anything more demanding than that with this splitter i hooked my laptop up through it and the fuse blew within one second sadly i 'd bought four of these since shipping cost as much as the item itself and all four died when i tried them with my laptop the back of the package says not to use items that use over a total of 10amps which seemed reasonable so i got out my ammeter and figured out that my laptop used 6amps at most so not only is this busted but they lie on the package i managed to open up the splitter and put in some more heavy duty wiring and a stronger fuse and then it worked for a short time until i started smelling plastic melting it turns out even one of the springs inside could n't handle 6amps and heated up enough to disfigure and melt plastic around it i give this item two stars only because you might want to plug in two cell phones simultaneously for anything else beware	11

0	i received my ph d in theoretical and applied mechanics from one of the best u s universities and for more than thirty years was teaching and researching in the field of solid mechanics before starting the reading of this book i was in the agreeable mood with the author 's that machines can never be human and that ai will retain \( if not forever \) for a very long time its name unreal but now i am dismayed the author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view making simple topics sound difficult and making diffcult ones look impossibble the inclusion of his strange tilings is strange all in all the book does not make sense moreover his 'note to the reader' \( which is patronizing arrogant and deceiving \) and his prologue and epilogue \( which are at best cynical \) should have warned me not to venture any further i cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers and most of all if this is the author 's usual way of communicating his ideas for his students luckily i did not buy this book for one person who could not stand reading through it dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor	11

1	i am extremely impressed with the feel look and general quality of the watch it contains the citizen miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price the comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch it has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links the foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more the mineral glass crystal is scratch resistant but not as good as a sapphire watch face but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal the display watchback is also mineral glass displaying the undecorated miyota automatic movement it look as stylish and run as well as my other watches and i receive as many comments if not more from the invicta 's it is a great looking watch ! good value accurate and stylish if you like the sub' look this is a good day to day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price band if it lasts 5 years it 's more than paid for itself	11

1	this is a real rarity a cinematic adaptation of a literary work that is just as good as the original novella from which the film came filmmaker gary walkow \( he co wrote the screenplay executive produced and directed the film \) has created a real gem in this brilliant translation of the best known short work by dostoevsky into film the casting is pitch perfect henry czerny perhaps best known for his portrayal of the weaselly fed in the harrison ford blockbuster clear and present danger is the right choice to play the underground man someone who despises himself so much that almost every interaction he has with another human being is full of rancor bitterness cynicism and or outright loathing sheryl lee is the prostitute whom he befriends and ultimately and violently rejects from his life jon favreau is the pompous rich guy who humiliates the underground man and merely laughs when the latter tries to humiliate him back the alternation of present \( shown effectively with a blue filter as the underground man video records himself \) with the past \( shown in full color signifying time gone by including a fantasy of what could have been \) is also extremely effective the extras included on the disk are superior there are not one but two commentaries one by walkow and czerny and the other by professor joseph frank of princeton university professor frank also provides a commentary independent of the film itself which is accompanied by stills from the film this is an abridged version of the full length commentary there is also a full length essay by professor deborah martin of columbia university analyzing the film sequence by sequence this makes for a truly rewarding cinematic experience and one i am sure that is a good fit for university instruction in dostoevsky it 's fitting perhaps that the last sequence of the film pulls back from the blue lensed perspective of the underground man filming himself so that we see a group of students watching him on several monitors this is a very clever cinematic trick by walkow but is not done just to be clever it provides an insightful view of the theme of the work itself egoism and how it traps us inside ourselves by offering a view from outside the filmmaker is indicating perhaps that we can view someone caught up in his own egoism and maybe learn from his experience on the other hand it could mean that since here we are students and by extension viewers at home watching the underground man rant about his own shortcomings we 're essentially caught in the same egoistic trap he 's in the difference is he rants about it we just sit and watch him highly recommended	11
0	this product is way too salty i did n't like it at all and neither did any of my family you ca n't get the taste out your mouth either after tasting one	11

0	there is not much i can add to these reviews here just like me a lot of people here were dissapointed because of the fact that so many classic 2pac songs were remixed only to sound like disasters why would such an abomination happen \? suge knight is trying to milk the pac legacy until it is bone dry well at least he has done something right if you ask me it sucks that this is how we are forced to remember tupac shakur over tracks chopped up into this die hard pac fans wo n't even like this if they have n't heard it already i'm so waiting for a remix album of the chronic and doggystyle if suge knight was smart you would reissue tha dogg pound 's dogg food on dual disc because that is the only reason why i do n't have that album yet	11
0	as the other reviewers make clear this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who ruined her so you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation problem is having just watched the movie i am not convinced there is anything below the surface prostitution is a fact of life in asian cities the theme of women overcome by their desires and in thrall to strong men a common one and i searched in vain for any subversion of or challenge to that fantasy \( as fantasy it is \) is this any more than a homage to the inutility of futility \? not that i can see	11
1	i love all of the bracelets that i 've purchased from this vendor they are cute and inexpensive also i 've recieved so many compliments on this bracelet i'm very pleased with this jewelry vendor	11
0	this is a 22 tee ball \? maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place since these should cost about 2 at your local sporting goods store maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package \( but it does n't say that clearly on the page \) bottom line is do n't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue	11

0	the beads and charms are nice enough but for the price you get very little with this kit only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers plus the charms there 's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies	11
0	and it was n't worth having to send it back seriously i thought maybe it was the batteries so i switched them no luck it ran very very slow and then it just quit as another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use it 's my guess that something melted warped in the mechanism i will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time i was able to use it so i 'll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash i have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it so i know all their merchandise is n't shoddy maybe i got a dud considering many others' positive reviews i sure hope so	11

0	well i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review truthfully i did n't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could care less about what happend the trailers and the dvd cover of this movie is very misleading one would think that they are going to see something from a great genre of horror movies about zombies and a group of people doing whatever it takes to survive i'm a big fan of romero movies and loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would be a cool australian take off i could n't be more wrong nothing in the movie makes sense from the start the entire movie is over the top starting with the actors everybody has entirely too much dialogue except for the main character who hardly says two words during the entire movie she looks lost confused and out of her league other characters include a local pilot and his pregnant girlfriend a wacky police sgt with his asthmatic partner the bait tackle clerk who never screams during the entire movie and our heroin character who won the local beauty contest the movie takes place in a small town in austrialia somewhere when meteors strike the earth \( and slam into people \) it unleashes a germ which causes people to become zombies our main characters all meet up and try to survive however aliens are involved so the story goes from a survival story to beams of light dressed in capes and floating around right in the middle of a big battle the viewer is left to wonder what 's going on at first but as the dialogue and story become unbearably bad you find yourself not caring as the minutes tick by i honestly could n't tell you much else because it 's just so terrible that i just simply could n't take a minute more bad acting bad dialogue over the top effects and some of the worst camera work i 've ever seen this movie apparently took two years to make imagine if they only had one \? \? \? another portion of this movie that makes me ill is the bait tackle charater he shows up out of nowhere and saves the heroin 's life like a bad clint eastwood impression \( with big hat covering his eyes to boot \) then he walks away when he appears again he 's able to do these matrix style backflips \( digging his spurs into the wall ceiling \) and making two pistols jump over his back and land directly into his hands does this guy ever miss \? what do you think \? he manages to kill about 50 zombies with his two pistols while hanging from the wall upside down not bad for a bait and tackle salesman living in the backwoods of australia ! if you dig the gore this one is ok but again wayyyy over the top i had no idea that one bullet from a 45 could blow someone in half our characters are so clueless that it actually takes them 3 4 of the movie to figure out how to shoot them in the head i personally counted several scenes where a character is shooting a police revolver and somehow manages to get 13 shots out of a 6 shooter someone get nasa on the phone and explain how you can do that because i just do n't get it the absolutely worst part of this movie without a doubt is the music it never stops ! there 's never a scene without music for some reason ! and it just makes what you 're watching seem absolutely cheesy ! it reminded me of a 1950 's serial pirate swashbuckling kind of thing with guys swinging on ropes and jumping across a gorge kind of thing the soundtrack is truly the worst i 've ever heard with extra cheese included did they use up their budget on the effects \? probably ! i found myself wishing that i could mute the music during the film ! if you 're a fan of good monster zombie movies i beg you to pass this one by and keep on moving it does n't make sense the story is amazingly weak the plot is well there is n't one you 'll wish you could have your 2 hours back i know i do ! ! !	11
0	ridiculous plot one dimensional cardboard like acting \( especially leon lai 's rigid dead like fish out of water performance \) incoherent dialogs horrible editing and directing every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline nothing deep but shallow all the way just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves long sleeves and black cloak even the white pigeons turned out to be dead nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat nothing at all curtain call drop it sooner than later	11
1	this may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch it 's big it 's ugly but has functions to make the fattest swiss army knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy overall i like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are the timepiece outstanding it has hh mm ss dd mmm of course with a year setting to avoid leap year issues this should go without saying in a modern digital watch stopwatch with lap function \( not that i ever use the lap function but i'm sure someone is interested \) countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown \( very easy to set \) three daily alarms special kudos for the alarms this is one of the loudest watch alarms i 've heard and i 've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this the altimeter largely eye candy but kind of neat over four days my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level \( by the maps about 40m asl \) not surprising because it is driven by the barometer and i never recalibrated it but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want need it the barometer yup it 's a barometer the part i like is the little display that shows the rising falling trend especially as this is always active \( even in normal 'time' mode \) the thermometer take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist the compass easily the best 'special' feature accurate precise \( enough for orienteering not for surveying \) easy to use it can be programmed for a declination but knowing me i 'd forget to reset it so i do declination the hard way the sighting notches are small but servicable the spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to suunto and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass an outstanding wrist compass the package big really really big but the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing \( a problem for me with other watches \) the battery has a shortish \( 12 18 month \) life but has a hatch so you do n't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance the display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground and the display light is just right readible even and glare free but not an emergency flashlight personally i'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap but the stock strap is n't bad just not great overall not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch compass and barometer and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter well designed thought out and manufactured but really big	11
1	the great outdoors deluxe smoker is exactly what i was looking for the lp gas is great for easy temperature control all i need to do while smoking is periodically check the level of liquid in the pan \( and add more wood chunks if desired \) the temomitor is easy to read and appears to be made of good quality the only complaint i have is the smoker is not foam protected inside the cardboard box when shipped thus my smoker had two minor dents in the corner of the smoker they do not affect the operation at all	11
0	microsoft office can be handy to have the files you can open edit and create with it \( most notably doc xls and ppt \) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options it 's \( relatively \) intuitive it has a pretty broad array of useful functions it 's also obscenely expensive considering the fact that you can get all of these things doc xls and ppt intuitive interface and functionality for free i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers make basic presentations or put together spreadsheets i was looking for basic functionality but i was pleasantly surprised openoffice does most of the neat tricks too \( actually it has a neat trick microsoft can never replicate it 's open source so it can respond to the needs of individual users you just say add this neat trick ! and someone will likely be able to do it for you \) it is possible that microsoft office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that openoffice does n't but considering the price differential i would n't splurge on this before checking	11

0	in our pursuit for ultimate baby items the infant carseat topped our list what 's more important than the safety of your first child especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving \? our search led us to this graco carseat and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a christmas gift just before our daughter 's birth in january the seat is fairly attractive but its good points stop there it 's a bear to install not because it 's complicated but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man \( or a woman unlike myself certainly \) to install the base we ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about 5 minutes tugging on the belts with all his might and then huffed and puffed and told us that should be in there real good now we examined it and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car and he replied oh they all do that that 's normal unsure but with the safety rating to back it we continued to use it throughout her first 7 months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat \( we have 3 4 door sedans a 1992 subaru legacy an 80 something oldsmobile and my mom 's 2006 saturn ion with the seat already in the car it 's a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once for me my husband simply ca n't put her in with the carseat already in the car not to mention that the seat while installed in the car has never felt especially stable with the exception of my mom 's ion which has the latch system of course the drawback of the ion is that my 6'1 husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard then in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we 're driving literally go around a curve look back and her seat 's at a 45 degree angle from the backseat of the car my daughter is 8 5 months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat we 've checked the belts that secure the seat pulled with all our might and the seat continues to malfuction this is a safety issue if i 've ever seen one with enough force she could end up directly on her side say the force of a side impact in an accident upon closer inspection i should n't be altogether shocked the base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits sort of like a wine glass i suppose so it 's top heavy and likely the heavier the load on top the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation needless to say we 'll begin shopping for a new seat immediately as for the snugride i would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it i 'd certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system and i 'd still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system in hindsight i wish i had shopped around a bit more	11

1	i bought one for a relative last christmas saw how convenient and easy it was to program so i bought one for myself this march it works just great the setup software programs the 670 easily and the logitech remote replaces the remotes for a hdtv a dvd home theater a v receiver a dishhd dvr receiver and a psyclone psc01 source selector one button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity i like the color screens and icons on the higher end logitech remotes but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use function wins forms this time round all is not rosy though added the sony ps3 to the entertainment arena the bluetooth requirements of the ps3 leaves it out of the ir rf remotes inner circle consider this if you need a combined solution for infra red rf as well as bluetooth devices \( the sony ps3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case \) fully backlit is a signifcant bonus none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features short version this cool tool really works and should satisfy most think out of the box though if you have a sony ps3 tied into your entertainment network click	11
1	in old chicago was a blockbuster movie made in 1937 a box office smash which contributed significantly to the emergence of 20th century fox as a major studio seeing the roadshow version of this film makes one wonder why fox bothered to put the shorter version on the dvd because you will never view it again all of a sudden the dramatic portions of the film make better sense with the smooth continuity of a henry king directed film and notably missing from the shorter version all the principals' performances improve too because what seemed quite superficial now has more depth for example instead of being told don ameche is an honest lawyer we see him in action instead of being told tyrone power is a crook we see him offering bribes power in particular is very convincing as the charming irish rogue the story is a corny tale of the o'leary family and has that hokey quality which undermined a lot of fox 's big productions by the time you have heard for the third time that we o'learys are a strange tribe you can almost hope that they suffer some unspeakable death when the fire starts ! alice faye plays belle fawcett the dance hall attraction whom the crooked power marries this was faye 's bid for major stardom when she replaced jean harlow who died just before production began faye is diffident at first but her confidence grows and the film was a great success for her her version of carry me back to ol' virginny is memorable alice brady won a best supporting actress oscar for her role as mrs o'leary but there is nothing to warrant it except a good irish brogue and the fact that she is playing a serious part for once instead of the screwball mothers for which she was typecast the special effects which make up the last 20 minutes of the film are spectacular and really give the film the status it has retained the dvd package contains a couple of short newsreels and a biography program of don ameche but it would have benefited from a commentary for such an important film	11

1	i am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original disgaea as such i will not get to much into the aspect of gameplay and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note having said that let 's begin the game begins in the land of veldime an alternate world from that of the first game where an evil overlord named zenon has hidden from well everyone when he came into veldime however he placed a curse on the land that changed all humans into demons the effects were n't all immediate as some still have several human qualities but if the curse is not reversed soon there will be no turning back thus the hero adell \( oddly enough the only person unaffected by zenon 's curse \) sets out to defeat the overlord in the opening there is an attempt to summon zenon to adell so he can fight him but it goes awry and zenon 's daughter accidentally gets summoned instead bound to adell by the summoning pact she has no choice but to accompany him to the castle where he intends to kill her father \( albeit not without scheming a bit herself \) in a nutshell the story is good nothing amazing but with ample opportunity for the humor most have come to love about the original the only really new additions to the battles are the ability to do stack attacks and if you are quick enough throw diagnally the basis of stack attacks are that after building the tower of aliies using the lift command the person on the bottom of the tower still has the ability to attack in doing so they begin passing the enemy up the tower with everyone taking a shot at him and then spiking him back to the ground essentially a team attack of up to 10 characters there have been updates to the dark assembly with 6 factions of senators being introduced and it can be easier to pass some bills if you are lucky since quite often some senators will show up to vote drunk \( random vote basically \) or even asleep \( no vote at all \) perhaps the most entertaining addition though is felonies you can recieve a felony for things such as power leveling having to much hp sp mana or even killing your own allies the benifit of felonies is that on top of any stat boosts you may get it is easier to pass proposals at the dark assembly and for every felony on a character they gain 1 extra exp this works all the way up to 300 felonies \( 300 exp bonus \) the game has made all the necessary additions to make the gameplay top that of the original however in my opinion there feels like something is missing the characters seem a bit more by the book and not as wonderfully absurd as the original that and the voice acting is n't quite as good as the that of the first disgaea \( plus etna has a new voice actress \) despite all of that however the game plays much better and even looks a bit smoother to boot all in all it is a great game and a worthy sequel to an amazing game while some may like the changes in the characters and others may not there is no denying that the core of the game is much better than the original and will keep you addicted for just as long if not longer	11

1	we bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline was lightweight and continues to be a functional comfortable stroller for our son the one feature that i expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go i was happy with the amount of storage but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag all in all we are very happy with this purchase !	11

1	i think this my first ep purchase ever and i generally feel that despite the quality many offer eps just are not worth it sam beam was clearly on a mission to change my mind as these apparent outtakes from the creek drank the cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut if not better i only very recently discovered iron and wine through our endless numbered days and have since been backtracking only to see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong the standout track to me is the night descending it has the feel of a track pulled right out of the past the other four tracks are just as excellent though and i think sam 's managed to make an avid fan out of me damn and just when i thought there were no new artists to be excited about !	11
1	at the time white was the only option red would have pleased my child more i 've found sp games which claim to work with the wireless attachement do not work \( communicate \) with ds games but as for the ds lite its a reasonable size perhaps slightly larger buttons would be nicer now they offer pink and black which is nice but exchangable covers would have been nice the stylus is just barely managable for adult hands but work fine for my child the screens are bright and no longer dimmable \( backlighting could be turned off in the sp one nice feature is many games allow some amout of co play with another ds even if your partner does n't have a copy stores like gamestop often have kiosks that allow you to download demos of different games thats nice but you cannot keep the demo thru a power cycle so that 's a bummer the biggest pain yet is i have not found a cable to communicate between the ds lite and the sp \( one does exist for the ds to sp \) oh an the power supply cable is different as well so while less bulky and better layout the ds lite steps you even further away from the accessories which worked between sp and ds \( first versions not lite \) such is the proprietary way i 'd really like to see more adult software for these things they are not far from a pda with their audio recognition and handwriting as well	11
1	this freeze dried peaches are great ! i found freeze dried peaches in my local health food store but they were so expensive i was looking for something more economicial these fit the bill perfectly the peices range in size from a small to a large crouton great bite sized peices that you can pop into your mouth shipping was fast too the order was shipped out on the same day and i had them at my door in less than a week \( a lot quicker than when amazon said they would be delivered \)	11
1	i had to put this review in because of the unfair one previously given before i purchased this software i checked out 5 6 of the major fish screensavers out their and this one is by far the most realistic \( movement background lighting and noise \) i have two computers one 800 mhz the other 1 4 ghz processor and the program runs perfect on both the goldfish screensaver is just as impressive if you 're into that kind of fish do n't let other marine freshwater screen savers fool you by advertising more fish and backgrounds the quality in all aspects especially 3d graphics and color \( which are a must if your looking for realism \) are poor i personally thought i 'd like the extra fish and backgrounds \( turtles in particular \) in a competitors screen saver so i purchased it instead of this one after trying it i was very disapointed and luckily i was able to receive a refund i purchased marine aquariun and have never regretted it since what 's great is they have a demo on their website your can try out too	11

1	if memory serves noted designer giorgio armani was once quoted as saying that his designs were created not to be noticed but rather to be remembered a wonderful thought typifying his always elegant classic style it 's certainly true of his latest fragrance for men black code this is a subtle sensual scent with a touch of the oriental found in notes of lemon and bergamot it 's an ultra masculine fragrance difficult to capture yet impossible to ignore true to armani 's vision the glass bottle is artfully crafted a cylinder of the deepest blue it 's gift boxed in the same color with printing in gray and white available in 1 7 and 2 5 oz sprays black code is sure to take its place by the side of armani 's always popular gio and mania	11

0	anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed are often given bad reviews its all pretentious pop culture drivel for the conformist weak willed mainstream american the worst part of rolling stone is the 100 greatest guitarists of all time list as they highly rate kirk hammett kurt cobain and tom morello \( all extremely overrated guitarists \) while rating eddie van halen at a very lowly 70 and not even mentioning these awesome guitarists kerry king jeff hanneman \( slayer \) john petrucci \( dream theater \) trey azagthoth erik rutan \( morbid angel \) jeff loomis \( nevermore \) steve vai and joe satriani if you know anything about good guitarists those eight guitarists i just mentioned destroy kirk kurt and tom do n't read this if you 're trying to decide what good music is you decide what good music is think for yourself do n't let mtv and rolling stone think for you	12

1	it was pretty damn funny ! this movie was recommended by my good friend bobby asslong in most cases his recommendations are a bunch of but he hit it right on with this one ! i detest tom green he is one of those guys who that when he fails at something \( talk show most of his movies life \) i actually feel happy and this is actually contrary to my normal personality i normally automatically love all canadians just kidding i normally want people to succeed and feel bad when they fail but tom green is so annoying great news ! he is in only about 4 or 5 scenes in this whole movie so you should be able to get through this movie with little to none hatred for mr green i love all the characters in this movie especially the main protagonist who accidentally sends the videotape to his girlfriend at a far away college he is very likeable and you 're pulling for him the whole time another thing i like this movie is that it pulls a lot from other gross out teen and college flicks but it does n't go overboard in the gross out department tom green plays the voice over explainer in the movie and he actually does a pretty good job without appearing stupid i give this high reviews ! mc white said check it out ! !	12
0	there are so many reviews saying this is a true story i have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real \( obviously \) about everything else is dramatized \( including the mission objectives scud hunting on foot which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today \) mcnab has essentially written tom clancy genre fiction the book bravo two zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol chris ryan called the one that got away however both are convincingly debunked by a third sas memeber in a book called the real bravo two zero also available on amazon though only the uk amazon site \( which you can still order from in the us \) in it an sas member who can actually speak arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people mcnab and ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story most importantly he manages to restore without a doubt the reputation of vince phillips blamed by ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the iraqis and a couple members eventually killed contrary to what you may expect i would recommend seeing this in fact i recommend getting and comparing all three books b20 the one that got away and the real b20	12
1	we bought this for our daughter 's first birthday she was immediately interested and so was her three year old brother in addition her five cousins \( ages 5 16 \) and their father \( 36 \) were also captivated there are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed initially she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them she is fourteen months now and puts them back on she presses the button to watch them spin she has taken it to the sitter 's and the kids there have played with it all day when we take it to the sitter 's i put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical so far it appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently we rotate toys but i leave this one out continuously and i often find her playing with it quietly by herself i have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play \( the gears can even be stacked \) is different from all other toys they have appeals to a wide range of ages grows with the child does not use up batteries \( we are still on the first set \) and seems very durable i recommend this toy	12

0	i would give this kit zero stars if i could the instructions say that it takes 6 8 weeks for the seeds to sprout i kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration not a single seed sprouted i finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over complete waste of time and money but if you 're feeling lucky you should know that most of the seeds in this kit are n't much bigger than pinheads and they all come packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag so if you want to have each type of plant growing in a different section of the plastic tray provided in the kit like that shown on the box cover you need to separate out each seed under a strong magnifying glass and even then you wo n't be successful as most of these seeds look just like ground pepper i accidentally spilled a few on the floor and after sweeping them all up i literally could n't tell them from the other debris in the dustpan by the way it takes a minimum of 6 8 years living in ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to reach the sizes shown on the box cover these are not plants that can simply be put on a windowsill they need an environment that is not easily provided in the average home lots of very bright light \( about 15 hours a day \) lots of humidity an acidic growth medium \( such as sphagnum moss \) and about 80 degrees and even then these are very slow growing plants to keep the humidity level high you 'll need some kind of terrarium preferably covered to keep the humidity level high but if you use incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light the amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to lethal levels for this reason i recommend a combination of fluorescent bulbs and a moist dry heating pad at the bottom be sure that whatever heating pad you use is n't the type that shuts off automatically after one hour of use some warnings these plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and nourishment the care you would normally give a houseplant will in all likelihood kill these plants never feed them animal protein \( like hamburger \) the fats in meat are n't digestible and can kill them never use tap water to water them the mineral build up can kill them so use distilled water only never feed them insects that have been killed by insecticides like raid carnivorous plants should be fed soft bodies insects like small slugs ants termites etc rather than hard shelled insects such as beetles well stocked pet stores will carry dried mealworms but even these will need to be cut into very small pieces just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food so too do venus flytraps never fertilize them these are very slow growing plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill them	12

1	we were having trouble deciding between this rower and the kettler coach this one was available thru amazon but the kettler had to be purchased thru merchantila which has a horrible reputation so we went with this model i could n't be more pleased where it was manufactured was not listed so i contacted lifecore i had a response within 24 hrs made in taiwan but do n't let that put you off this is not a china quality product it 's very sturdy smooth and silent the preset programs vary not only in intensity but time some are 10 minutes some half an hour have n't tried them all four programs are for you to set ordered it on a monday here by friday my husband had it set up before i got home from work he did complain that the instructions were n't well written but he never complained about actually putting it together must not have been too difficult all tools were included you can also set your workout by time distance calories and strokes while checking merchantila 's bbb rating i also checked lifecore 's they have no complaints that also helped us decide i love this machine i'm sorry i did n't get a rower sooner	12

1	eraserhead is filled with strange uncanny scenes what is it to be uncanny \? dictionary com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis beyond the ordinary or normal mysterious arousing superstitious fear or dread uncomfortably strange i would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time one has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere the movie does not have a linear logical storyline it is a mood piece for want of a better term a visual poem which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen if you let your mind play among these images it will begin to invent meaning for itself you may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it the cinematography is stunning not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term but arresting you simply cannot turn your head away will you like it \? well i think this is one of those movies you either love or hate think of it as a rorshach how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are	12

1	dexter gordon is dale turner an ex patriot jazz musician living in paris and playing nightly at the blue note \( his character is based loosely on lester young and bud powell but mainly it is all dexter \) a young frenchman \( francois cluzet \) idolizes him and later befriends him dex has problems mainly booze and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink the cliche of the self tortured jazz musician who 's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is of course the main focus of the film \( that this is the only way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform but it sells \) dex gets homesick for new york returns falls into his old habits misses the flight back to paris and soon dies the movie is overly long but gordon is mesmerizing dexter speaks slowly as if from behind a veil \( gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in mexico when he agreed to do the movie \) he had much input on the film creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy the picture has faults to be sure but it 's a mighty achievement nonetheless the music of which there is plenty is of course top notch	12
1	people will no doubt find the nintendo ds lite to be a way for nintendo to sucker people out of their money it can be that way if you think of yourself as a sucker but for me the ds lite is a little better simply put if you 're content with your original ds then do n't even waste time to buy this one if you do n't have a ds period the ds lite is a much better investment than the original bulky one with the ds lite gameplay is made a little simplar the button placement and brighter screen make the gameplay a little better for one the start and select buttons have been moved to resemble where they were on the original gameboy advance this makes handling some of the functions \( especially for gba games \) a lot easier the buttons sadly are a still a little small for guys with big hands like myself the ds lite also comes with a phony gba cartridge \( called a cap \) if you do n't have a gba game plugged into the system you can put in the phony cartridge to keep it from collecting dust in there however when you do stick in a gba game it sticks out by about a centimeter it just looks weird the cap does at least keep the system looking good perhaps the most welcome change to the ds lite is the screen the original ds screen was not exactly bright in fact it was in comparison the ds lite rather dark games like metroid prime hunters were darker than they had to be on this new screen the difference in how bright the games appear really shows not only that but you can adjust the brightness if need be it does n't really affect the battery life either you can play the ds lite for as long as you played the original and also like the original it charges while you play another welcome difference is the touch screen itself these screens last a lot longer than the original ds those who have an original ds no doubt experienced a lot of scratches on their screen from their stylus to the point where it was noticeable you could still see the screen but it was apparent that the stylus was doing a number on it the screen is more protected here the stylus does n't scratch the screen quite as easily in other words the touch screen lasts a lot longer the ds lite also looks better and fits in your pocket better it also performs all the tasks of a regular ds for example if you 're playing a game and you suddenly have to go just flip it closed and it sleeps there 's also a place to store the stylus and the stylus is better too it 's a little bigger and thicker so it 's not quite as easy to lose some problems with the original ds still plague the ds lite however you still ca n't play gameboy color or regular gameboy games on the ds lite also you still ca n't configure the controls to play a gba game much easier in other words you ca n't configure x and y when you play a gba game this probably wo n't bother you in the long run however also the touch screen still has its sensitivity touching the touch screen with your bare hands is more dangerous than the stylus scratching the screen the oils from your fingers might damage the screen and therefore it wo n't respond to the touch of even your stylus when the original ds launched owners will note that there were not very many good games availible about the only good game during its launch in 2004 was super mario 64 ds now there are plenty of games out there \( and not all of them are ports \) so if you do want a ds this is a great time to get one and the ds lite is a better investment than the original one by far the ds may not play movies or mp3 players but to be honest that almost defeats the purpose of a gaming system am i looking to buy a portable entertainment center \? of course not i'm looking to find a system to play some of my games on and the nintendo ds delivers real gamers know it 's about the games not about the bells and whistles of a system for the casual gamer the nintendo ds delivers and the ds lite is a fine improvement the good vastly superior to the original ds it fits in your pocket easier the screen is much brighter touch screen is more durable the placement of the start and select buttons is easier a better stylus the battery life is unchangedthe bad those with an original ds who want a ds lite will have to spend more money for yet another ds some of the cons of the original ds are still her	12

0	the little rascals collection is a set of 5 dvds with a few shorts on each dvd the fifth disk with an extra from the 50s and a documentary about child stars this set was poorly put together the shorts included are quite random and buying this set would be a waste of money each disk opens with a montage of some of the characters first there is alfalfa then buckwheat spanky darla porky mickey stymie then fatty oh wait no that is joe cobb only they did n't know his real name then farina and last phil macmahon who you may be asking \? phil macmahon the kid who got bitten by the love bug in a song number in our gang follies of 1938 still do n't know him \? maybe that is because he was n't a regular cast member and should never have been featured like he was in this collection disk one features the shorts dogs of war and derby day dogs of war is a silent film featuring the gang running loose on the hal roach lot it is one of my favorite shorts from the series however it seems that they ripped off the cabin fever print and added a worse score derby day also seems to be lifted from the cabin fever series it is a silent film about the gang visiting the horse races the films themselves are very good disk two features a rarer silent film called stage fright it is a film about a show put on about marc anthony by the kids in front of their parents it is a total disaster just like in reunion in rhythm one kid wants to go out on stage and recite poetry the film has been seriously cut there are no opening credits and the short is much shorter than the usual film length the print is washed out and new title cards have been inserted the music is much more childish than normal silent rascals scores but it works there are sound effects too sundown limited is a great short about the gang building their own train it is a very cute film farina is especially funny in it the train that the kids build would have been the envy of all the children in the neighborhood the print is washed out and the music sounds just like grapevine video 's soundtracks the film titled the pirates in this set is really called the buccaneers it is also a cute film about the kids trying to build their own ship when it sinks they find a real one to destroy this short has also been cut there is no opener for it either it is a bad print and has kiddie music attached to it disk three opens with mary queen of tots it is a really enjoyable film where mary receives toys that look like the gang she dreams they come to life and when she wakes up she finds the gang and believes they are her dolls come to life this print is really bad especially considering there is a better print available on another cheaply made dvd set it is funny that the music is the same on this set as on that one though the fourth alarm is a film about the kids becoming junior fire fighters the print on this one is not bad at all the last film is school 's out a talkie featuring a different cast it is a film featuring miss crabtree the new teacher the picture is good it seems to be the one from cabin fever disk four begins with bear shooters this is a less than great film the print is great it is the one from cabin fever our gang follies of 1938 is a great film very funny long and exciting it features the later talkie cast waldo 's last stand is a film from the later mgm years a lesser film that seems forced it was also released in a 5 part rascals set disk five is the extra features dvd it starts out with a segment from the you asked for it television show on it some of the silent gang are reunited joe cobb jackie condon farina hoskins johnny downs and mickey daniels are featured the documentary called kid stuff really does n't have a whole lot of information about the gang although jackie cooper is mentioned and butch bond does an interview other child stars like jackie coogan judy garland shirley temple roddy mcdowall and ron howard are focused on as well the films in this collection are films that have lapsed into the public domain many of them have been available cheaply for years the only reason a fan might want to see this collection the same reason i bothered was to see the rarer silent films however the rest of the set is trash	12
1	if you like the big weber grills but need a small one for tailgating this is a great choice i have no problem putting 3 4 or even 5 steaks on this grill with no problem it 's tight and well built the only thing i do n't like is the kind of cheap side went covers they come flat so they do n't conform to the shape of the grill you have to kind of form them by bending them around your knee or something and then they fit fine i give this grill 9 out of 10 brats edit one year later they made a big mistake moving the vent holes from the traditional place on the bottom of the kettle to the sides it completely changes the air flow and the result is a consistently cold fire my three minutes per side burgers on the normal webber are more like five or six minutes per side on this little grill the bottom line is that this grill is ok for tailgating and camping but i do n't use it nearly as much as i thought i would and if i had to have just one grill i 'd get one of the other webbers with the vents on the bottom this grill has been a disappointment for me	12
1	the other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste where i agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge ! ! this cereal is excellent for taste consistancy and it is gluten free ! if you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin !	12

1	those who condemn this book for not being a long boring list of name origins and meanings or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today 's children are missing the point baby names now is a fun readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s including famous namesakes \( saints popes presidents royalty music and movie stars \) and what some celebrities have named their children it 's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style for example lisa amy susan and dawn were very popular for babies born in the 60s \( and thus my classmates \) but are rarely used today the book 's major flaw is in not recognizing that parents name their children using the last names of people they admire not just the first names at one point it reads harrison ford is almost certainly the reason for the name harrison 's popularity excuse me ever hear of the beatles \? the entries for the name jordan do n't mention michael jordan certainly a major inspiration for that name in this area the entry for jackson does n't mention michael janet or samuel l the entry for landon does n't mention michael the entries for cassidy do n't mention david and shaun so popular in the 70s when many of today 's moms were growing up the entry for lucas do i have to say it fellow star wars kids grown up and naming their children \? and come on how can you mention the name wayne without acknowledging the popularity of john wayne \? still this is a lot of fun and i give the authors credit for recognizing that althea is from a grateful dead song i look forward to the next edition	12

1	hello fellow amazon'ers out there in cyber land \) i grew up in the mi tv series era as a tv dvd collector of primarily 60 's 80 's series and member of a couple of tv dvd forums on the 'net i can mention to all of the amazon'ers out there that this is a gem that we 've been wanting on dvd for years as for some of the cruise posts i saw the 1st mi film and as others mentioned here it 's somewhat like comparing apples and oranges from a tv dvd collectors point of view we want the \( tv series remake \) films released since in a lot of cases the studios will release the original tv dvd series as a market tie in coinciding with the film release tv dvd collectors may not purchase the film on dvd but in a lot of cases the film gets the job done for the tv series release my favorite season of this series was s1 i liked steven hill in the imf force team leader role just a little better than peter graves although i thought graves did an outstanding job in the role after hill left the series i also liked the original script line of please dispose of this recording in the usual manner \) what can we say about the landau bain team on this show \? classic ! and what a casting jackpot for greg morris in the tech electronics genius role \) this series is a must buy for most of the tv dvd collectors out there it 's simply put a sure thing gem for your collection i only hope that additional seasons will make it to their release s as the saying goes it 's all about the 's \( sales 's \) hopefully this set will sell well on the 'net stores and your local outlets as always should any of your dvd 's dislodge from their hubs in transit the shipper will disavow any knowledge of their existance \) signing off from dallas tx this poster may self destruct in 5 seconds	12

1	touchstone is one of the better magazines journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past the editors numerous in number are orthodox roman and protestant christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the church in other words they realize that tradition is the glue that holds the church together and by extension sanitizes and sanctifies culture first things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well enjoy !	12
1	none of the other nonsticks can hold a candle to this stuff ! i bought this and the 8 fry pan 2 months ago and except for the bottoms still looks brand new despite being used nearly every day i even used a bacon press \( cast iron \) in it every time i cooked bacon and a couple of times i accidently scraped the inside side of the pan with no marks left hubby stacked knives and forks inside then topped it off with 6 dinner plates i thought it was done for scratches and nicks everywhere but no not a single mark my calphalon commercial nonstick \( which hit the trash already \) looked like it had been through a war when my 18 yr old did that i must admit though that i do not use metal utensils in it nor do i put in a dishwasher since i wo n't have one til the kitchen is remodeled overall though just from what abuse it has gotten i'm very impressed and will buy more my advice \? do n't mess with the rest buy the best and this is it going to try the wok next wish they sold an electric griddle with this stuff in it	12

0	this movie has the feel of a late night monster fest hosted by svengoolie or elvira i had no idea what this was about when i started watching it but by the end i wished i would have skipped it entirely the story starts off well with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious monster \( that you do n't see at first \) from there it goes downhill it felt like a low rent 'pet sematary' i have never read the short story that this was based off of but i'm sure that king made his scarier than this movie could ever be the best acting in the movie comes from brad dourif best known for his performance as billy bibbit in 'one flew over the cuckoo 's nest' and the voice of chucky the killer doll from 'child 's play' as an exterminator	12

0	i was really looking forward to this game and i was prepared to overlook one or two things every game has it 's own personality right \? i found instead this game actually does n't have much of one at all i did n't mind the graphics not cutting edge sure but not that bad either a little muddy but a change from cartoony it was hard to enjoy closeup views however when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom no way to toggle that feature the camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately not that there was much time to look at the scenery immigrants came and came and came whether there were houses and jobs available or not as long as city happiness was high enough which meant that everyone was happy which they were not because they had no houses or jobs to keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy forget planning forget balancing resources with workshops and markets it was n't clear what the balance was in any case it would take trial and error and you did n't have the time for you were building worshops like mad trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves the best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade it was through research maximising the tax base with the development of currency and so on you hit those early on and reached a certain population level you made money the rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving there was no stability in reaching any level it quickly became a game of keep up there was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development and for all the decorative options more than the similar games out you really did n't care in the end what your city looked like because it just cost time money too but that was really not the relevant issue unless people were unhappy then you could stick a few things quickly somewhere you just ca n't enjoy a leisurely pace of planning building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run you have to be constantly involved in the process staying ahead of the curve you do n't have to worry about maintenance such as city fires or engineers but the cities cannot not be made self sufficient or self sustaining with this inherent instability built into the gameplay five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities if not all to a screeching halt while i enjoyed the research options and the ability to move homes i thought was a great innovation not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the gameplay ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying	12

1	this gauge works well and is easy to read it seats well and does mostly what it should there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what i have read in other reviews let 's clear a few things up first of all you do not have to wait ten seconds between readings you do have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings secondly you do not have to send the unit back to replace the batteries the instructions very clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries \( if you were to read the instructions \) the hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what i have read elsewhere maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then i use mine in the garage very nice gauge	12

1	the story walk across the sea by susan fletcher takes place at a town near the ocean white people thought themselves superior to others especially the chinese chinese were often looked down upon and shunned mainly because of their religious beliefs the lighthouse keeper 's daughter however was different from other white people believing her father 's talks about chinese people in the beginning of the story the girl eliza jane meets a chinese boy around her age after the chinese boy saves her goat eliza becomes interested in the boy 's behavior soon she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed this story was rather interesting in a way the time of the story show how the characters act and think the story also shows how different some characters are such as eliza 's father and mother \( something moved inside me like a sudden shift in the wind \) eliza was also in a way different from other white people she befriended and showed kindness toward the chinese boy \( `you 'll do him no harm \? i have your word on it \? ' \) i was also amazed by the twist of the story when the story reveals that the father truly worries about the chinese boy of all of the stories i have read i have never found one that was perfect this story is no different when the chinese people were driven out of the village by angry white people i could feel the same shock and anger eliza felt the story however has a few more bad parts one boy amos accidentally broke eliza jane 's nose while trying to find the chinese boy afraid that he might get in trouble the boy lied to his father about breaking eliza 's nose to make matters worse amos blames the fault on the chinese boy ! \( i had a mind to shout at him to tell him to put her down \) on the other hand i did not like how eliza acted toward the chinese boy when they first met when the boy yelled a warning eliza thought he was trying to scare her off so he could steal her goat therefore when the boy was holding the goat eliza thought that he was taking the goat from her when what really happened was that the boy saved the goat from a wave even so that was not the worst part of the story \( `get you from me ' he said `i ca n't be near you now get out of my sight ! ' \) as a father eliza 's father was expected by me to listen and talk to eliza about her chinese friend and maybe even understand why she was protecting him as a result i was shocked and disappointed in her father when he told her that he did not even want to talk to her ! thankfully there was nothing worse than this part of the story \( terrible things can happen in this world things you ca n't explain away it 's not safe here andrew john i ca n't promise you 'll be safe but there are miracles too like you and love and glories well beyond our knowing \) the ending where eliza talks to her baby brother about life and the chinese boy was my favorite part it ties everything together and concludes the story about friendship	12

0	i have been slogging through this book for weeks now it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium the book lacks any narrative thrust often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to set the record straight and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its barbaric european contemporaries	12

0	okay so i'm not as astute in the technical aspects of software as some reviewers but i can say that my experience with this software is absolutely terrible first off it is built to integrate with outlook but does n't really it always leaves one e mail in your outbox \( the one you posted first \) if you open your outbox before they send then the one you posted most recently wo n't send either seriously the only way i have been dealing with this is that i have left a dead e mail in the box permanently if i need to change something that has been posted to the outbox i have to open it then get out of the outbox change it and repost it otherwise it wo n't send ever i have set nis so that it does n't scan my outgoing e mail as it blocks anything over 2mb and in my business i send things that big all the time in a recent update however it has reinstated that and now scans all of my outgoing e mail whether it is set to or not i spent hours and hours on the phone with \( supposed \) technicians who refused to answer any questions unless i disabled my whole network what that has to do with this program i do n't know i tried the live internet chat function but and i kid you not it took almost two hours for me to get ten responses from the guy when i complained he hung up on me gotta love that when i tell nis that something it has categorised as spam is n't spam it does n't remember the sender 's e mail address like it is supposed to it just keeps calling it spam and quarantining it regarding spyware i have another piece of anti spyware software called webroot spy sweeper that routinely finds spyware on my computer that nis did n't catch this has just been one headache after another their customer service was unresponsive and totally unhelpful with not one actual solution to any of these problems the only piece of software i have ever bought that was anywhere close to as bad as this is winfax 10 another norton product i will never ever buy another piece of norton symantec software again as long as i live they should be ashamed of themselves	12

0	like other reviewers after careful research i decided to purchase this product it was affordable received good reviews and was of bigger size than others in the similar price range when i received it in mail i was quite happy it worked great out of the box and it looked even nicer than what i had expected the screen was bright and very attractive the problems started about three weeks following the purchase first the slideshow option \( the kind with music \) stopped working whenever i pushed the slideshow button the screen would completely freeze and i had to restart the unit in order to use any other function i thought no big deal i would just exchange the frame for another one my second unit arrived yesterday this one however started having problems right out of the box after about 5 minutes into the slideshow the screen started flickering than shaking became completely staticky and finally it re started automatically i played it two more times after that each time with a similar thing happening 10 or 15 minutes into the slideshow it is obvious this photoframe has a lot of potential \( big bright screen \) unfortunately the software is very buggy i checked the portable usa website and it does not appear that they have any patches that could be downloaded as a fix i will have to return this unit again this time for a refund my assumption is that this product has received many positive reviews because people like it after they initially open the box however i would be curious to learn if others have had a similar experience after several weeks or months of ownership	12

1	just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from western digitals website you should have no problems very nice	12
0	i have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to windows vista as a result of the windows upgrade this product just lost half its value for me the drive works fine physically but the included backup software will not work with vista when i try to schedule an overnight backup the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling as others have noticed here western digital offers zero support for its software i cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem	12
1	the pouch is vacuum sealed and holds about 100gms of delicate deep emerald leaves i use about a tsp for a 12 16oz cup it is very important to avoid using boiling water if you want to get the full benefits and flavor of this tea water at a rolling boil will overcook the tea and you will notice that the tea quickly turns brown in the cup if you adhere to directions and use water at 80 deg c you will be left with a wonderful cup of green tea that stays green i absolutely love the fresh grassy flavor of this tea and it is a wonderful pick me up the first sip of this tea leaves a distinctly sweet note on the tongue even though there is no actual sugar in the tea ! i have spent hundreds on different teas but i keep returning to this one as my staple	12
1	great magazine for families with kids ! my son loves all of the activities that can be done ! great price too	12

0	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	12

1	this is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures they are usually seasonal meaning 4 5 issues a year this particular magazine is mostly black white pictures at least the issues i 've bought were this is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut a majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above this is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait	12

1	my granddaughter requested this for christmas and i had a hard time finding it until i checked the amazon site it's just what she wante	12
1	this movie is such a breath of fresh air finally there 's a movie that 's profound amusing and relatable it 's nice to watch something that really hits home without begin cheesy or overdone and you can never go wrong with jean louisa kelly or amanda peet	12
0	the best scene in the movie is the italian restaurant scene with janeane garofalo using a wry randy quaid as her foil when she 's not ignoring him it 's the only scene that made me laugh the scene with the playboy dad having three women in his home and the one preceding it when his girlfriend 's excessive dinner fails to impress the little kids are both weak playboy dad is not interesting and that character really should n't have been one of the three musketeers of this movie the other dad reiser is uncomfortable to watch his dinner scene with his daughter is good in the sense that it shows how estranged a father can be with his teenage daughter but that too is uncomfortable to watch the later scene up in the treehouse when his daughter suddenly loves him is completely unbelievable the fact is that particular girl would not say those things to her dad she does n't love him she does n't need him at all she 's done with him the stupid bit about randy quaid being a talk show star after busting into rob reiner 's talk show is just dumb that does n't happen if you want to write a cartoon get warner brothers to draw it for you have the road runner in it or bugs bunny the film gives us comfort food at the end with the trite and meaningless advice to love your kids the fact is that your kids need love from their father when they are young but once they hit a certain age in double digits you are done daddy just becomes the source of cash from then on kids in their teens and twenties do n't want or need anything but money from dad fittingly i saw this film on father 's day to sum the whole movie up janeane garofalo is funny randy quaid is kind of comfortable to watch although the script gets a little stupid at the tail end and the other two male leads are just mildly annoying the script does n't say anything worthwhile about the subject it took on but it takes a subject on so at least that 's something it gives exposure and food for thought on the subject of how a father fits into his family	12
1	as we 've heard it 's not easy being green it 's more than easy it 's delightful if you 're an avobath bath ballistic infused with avocado \( hence the name \) and olive oil it moisturizes skin the fragrance is fresh rather citrusy thanks to lemongrass and rosewood bath water is a lovely shade of green rather like new spring grass if there 's glitter in it i did n't find any which was as i wished it 's suggested for morning i 'd relax with an avobath any time of day	12
0	i love coconuts and would love it if this made my hair smell like coconuts instead my hair smells like burnt coconuts or even burnt newspaper the conditioning qualities of the product are n't good enough \( and it certainly is n't cheap enough \) to make me purchase this again at least not until i develop a hankering for smokey smelling hair	12
1	i love this grill just last night i made pizza on it for the first time it 's got a awesome amount of cooking space for such a portable grill it 's great we use it on our patio all the time the build quality is great and it 's very easy to cleani think they even added some vents into the design so the airflow is awesome and with amazons free shipping you cant find a better deal anywhere	12
0	this potty is completely useless it is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it it is unstable on those little plastic legs and it 's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it this potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless	12
0	first of all they did n't sent me the pictured panties but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print butt ugly second they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse returned right away very disappointing	12
1	i purchased this for a betta fish which was a gift for my cats this model was perfect because the lid screws on which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish there is a small hole at the top so you do n't have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish the aqua gems cover the bottom but i added some gravel for additional covering also the aqua gems are light and you lose some when changing the water so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually the one negative i found is that the light is basically useless it illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly other than that i'm very satisfied i did look at petsmart for additional oxygen stones but they do n't sell them not sure if those are really necessary though	12
0	this thing basically self destructed the first week the handle pieces would n't stay together and when i pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart not worth the money ! i was very disappointed	12
0	our family loves all types of memory games and this is the most attractive the colorful stripes on the back are great the pictures are good the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity in fact i would like to know this myself	12
0	ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander got my tickets in advance and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater the movie was a huge dissapointment while i was n't expecting the movie to be just like the book i certainly was n't expecting that while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears despite the fact that i 've read it over 100 times	12
1	we have used scansoft nuance products for over five years as a matter of fact i am writing this review using dragon 8 omnipage pro 15 along with the pdf converter is by far the best on the market the technical support has been fantastic throughout the years and the engineers always had open ears for recommended changes omnipage pro 15 has saved me thousands of dollars because of its unbelievable ocr accuracy with a click and a choice i can now convert a pdf document into xl as spreadsheet before this technology was created it was such a hassle when i have to fill out a form omnipage pro 15 uses the saved information to help me the program can run in the background and does not freeze or slow down my system edward lamplpresident of healthcare recruitmentstuart search group	12

0	i love britney so i went against the bad reviews ! man was i wrong it is sooooo bad ! ! its the worst dvd in history	12
1	i bought this as a present for my wife i was looking for something that she could carry in her purse the automatic functions are easy and functional it is not an enthusiasts camera too hard to get into the menus the screen is easy to turn off \( this sucks battery power \) and it even has an optical viewfinder \( a rare finding lately \) the optical viewfinder helps to get steady pictures for those of us with the shakes the pictures are clear and the colors are excellent the drawback is the that sony batteries cost an arm and a leg the wire for downloading pix is multifunctional and very proprietary \( read that as expensive if you lose it	12
1	i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers it has improved with this version i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program what it claims to do it does well if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program	12
1	it 's as good if not better than volume 1 of cartoons that time forgot the episodes are a bit more wierd in this volume hope there will be a volume 3 coming out soon	12
0	i purchased this album because i am a fan of the last poets upon listening to the samples provided by amazon com i thought i was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the last poets some great politically charged poetry perhaps accompanied by some funky beats however when i listened to the whole cd i was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like get out of the ghetto blues if more of the tracks had the sound of the title track this would be a five star album in my opinion true scott heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album but not in the form i had hoped for i would take the last poets' album this is madness over this particular scott heron album	12
0	very disappointing ! i ordered stretch jeans i paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not stretch jeans i called cust service he spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he \( bealls cust serv \) sent me another pair i would get the same thing in order to get money back i had to return the item now i 've paid postage again ! and yes i did receive the 12 99 credit for the jeans but what about the postage \? this was not my fault ! the item was incorrect ! ! your return policy indicates that yo uwill pay the postage so if you need to see a copy \( which i also put in the return box \) of what i ordered please feel free to contact me i printed it out so i can fax it scan it email it or snail mail it or however you would like to receive it please return the shipping costs that i paid for a product that apparently mismarked thanks debbie pearson p s i see the title description has been corrected to show that these are not stretch jeans wish i would have known so that i would not have to be writing this review if no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon but especially not bealls	12
1	kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth the dreaming was underrated when it was first released but i think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time this is a superb album tracks like sat in your lap suspended in gaffa leave it open night of the swallow houdini and get out of my house proving this point there 's lots of anger on this album as kate put it herself many years ago and it is her darkest effort to date but it 's pure brilliance ! buy it and be convinced	12
1	do n't listen to the whinnier if you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills this helps you must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money it is worth the effort ! i noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work i also purchased the music cd 's produced by the same company they are helpful as well i use them at work at home and in the car the brain builder booklet mentions the cd 's if you want to stop looking stupid because you ca n't remember information or you 're tired of getting lost while driving this will help you	12
1	i purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew who just loves it it is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it now only if he would put it down so others can look at it	12
0	in my experience this camera takes great pictures but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate	12

0	most annoying thing is that i hooked up through hdmi for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the hdmi \( i used optical \) what the hell is the deal with that \? at first i thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your tv or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well hdmi is supposed to make it more convenient 1 cable etc why is this necessary \? \? \? \? \? \? \? secondly my receiver is not working properly the sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99 of the time running the auto macc fails out manually i see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker \? \? \? \? \? nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part surround left is silent as it should be occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm if i select the different output options basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing i am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as i do think the receiver is nice if its working i enjoy the ipod dock that has output to your tv as well i major concern is something is wrong with there hdmi circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well i will update when i get the replacement installed	12
1	to bring the co sleeper up to the height of the bed these leg extensions are the best bet yes as someone else said they do make it a little shaky so if you are not planning to attach the co sleeper to your bed you may want to leave the height alone \( you 'll be getting up anyway so it probably does n't matter how tall it is \) but once attached to the bed with the anchor strap rather than free standing it was very secure	12
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	12
1	i 've seen that they are referred to as licorice with a cream filling they kinda have that texture but not at all that flavor much more like a fruit roll up with a sugary cream inside i like them	12
1	so far the device has entirely lived up to expectations atomic clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough there is often about a 1 2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other but this is minor for the uses we get out of it \( a quick look at outside temps during the winter \) the only issue we ran into that was problematic was the ice alarm feature this feature sets off the devices alarm anytime the temperature drops between 32 and 27 degrees or so to alert you to possible icy conditions the problem is that in cold climates the temperature hovers in that range all winter long so the alarm goes off continually every 40 seconds or so we just happened upon a solution that has worked perfectly the ice alarm only works on channel 1 so if you set the outside sensor to channel 2 or 3 the ice alarm is disabled and is no longer triggered obviously they should have an ability to shut it off but this is it and even this is n't listed in the instructions	12
0	why should one buy this series \? what about the missing episodes \? are they going to be added later or this is it \? i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel \? or a keyboard without the c and r keys \? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do	12
0	i will admit i am a sucker for hair products i have very thick hair that at times can be a little wild i have used fekkai products before and their okay certainly not worth the over inflated price tag but i read the reviews for this product and thought it might be the perfect solution for my hair during the winter months wrong answer ! this product is very thick too thick for me to spread through my hair without putting some work into it conditioners and hair masks should be well conditioning i left this hair mask in the required 20 minutes and it did nothing in fact i had to go back through my hair with my 6 00 pantene conditioner just to make my hair manageable i also have to wonder what the purpose is of putting pieces of nut shells into a product that is supposed to condition hair \? all those pieces are going to do is rough up your hair cuticle ladies spend your money on a book that reviews hair products ! i did and i 've realized that all hair products are essentially the same only the name and perfumes change read paula begoun 's book about hair products	12

1	well i do n't even know where to start for this camera but about a year ago when this camera first got launched to the digital camera market it costed nearly twice as much as what you can pay for it now for the price this camera has alot to offer i just love the color tone of fujifilm you get a very studio like effect with fujifilm ccd technology this camera has many manual controls and features that will interest both professional and amature photographers the 9 megapixel can really be helpful when it comes to cropping the pictures taken by this camera is bright and clear the camera picture can be noisy if you set the iso above 400 so for the best result just set the iso level as low as possible \( lets say iso 80 \? \) the 10 7x zoom lens is very convenient when you want to get close to the subject you are shooting i used this camera for every occasion and it never failed me i heard alot of complaints about the poor battery life of this camera but just buy nimh battery that is about 2500 mah and above and you should get about 200 250 shots make sure to buy at least a 2 gb memory card because the picture files are pretty big especially in raw format also for the price this camera feels very solid in the hand it feels very professional and sturdy \( made in japan \) the buttons are nicely placed and very easy to use make sure to buy an external flash if you want to do some serious light photography i recommnend the sunpak 383 non dedicatted flash to go with this camera it works together really well anyway for 407 you cannot get a better camera than this one thank you amazon for making this good deal possible again i highly recommend this camera	12

1	these films used to be on tv all the time i was amazed at how clever the plots were i did n't remember some of them weird woman is my favorite b film and i'm always recommending it to people movies used to be so entertaining ! it 's great to have this collection available to film fans we can overlook chaney 's stiffness as the rest of the cast really compensates for it	12

1	i 've been in the newspaper business for many years and i 've always used recorders at governmental meetings interviews etc much easier and faster than taking notes and it allows me to focus more on my subject until now i 've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event this little sony is the perfect size picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear additionally it has a long battery life and i never run out of room while i'm taping i could n't ask for more	12
0	these noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old she bonks herself with them my toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them they make fairly interesting noises but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size no one really plays with them much i would not recommend them	12
1	we bought this toy for our 1 year old son it is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great i agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well my biggest compaint however is that when both lids are closed the wagon looks just like a 2 step ladder our son constantly tries to climb it like stairs the other day he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle my son fell over with it and crashed on his face there are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon but they do not prevent it from falling over my son is fine but this toy is very dangerous and i do not recommend it !	12
0	i really like the crane humidifiers for children my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time it occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet so i was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good i was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than i had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it did n't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off this may be a fault with the one i received and so i have sent it back or it may be a design flaw with this shape i have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere so although i have n't had chance to use it i am more hopeful of success it is important to empty these humidifiers regularly and clean them i forgot for a few days and was horrified at the build up of slimy stuff and the smell of mould in such a short time	12
0	i rarely write reviews but quoting ebert \( who inexplicably liked this ! \) i hated this movie 1 is editor the correct term to apply to joe klotz \? i give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4 if you want to see a good slow paced movie watch l'aaventura for a much better recent indie film about family life buy the squid and the wale 2 if the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well amy adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb but sweet southerner \( see forrest gump waterboy \) i guess her performance reaffirmed what hollywood thinks of the south notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from california or ny does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs \? 3 i assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism i feel bad for the masochists but not the pretentious pseudo intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit 4 rent this first and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not 19 9	12
1	this bruschetta topping is made from perfectly ripe tomatoes and capers and has a full baslamic base note the chuncky texture is perfect for those who would prefer home made but the quality is as good or superior to the sauces i 've made at home i like the other flavors of pasta sauce too but the bruschetta topping is my favorite for its chunky texture ripe fruit and deft balance of seasonings	12

1	the league of extraordinary gentlemen was based on a pretty good graphic novel and as a movie its pretty good itself where else could you ever hope to see the likes of captain nemo dorin gray mina harker the invisible man dr jeckyl mr hyde allan quatermain tom sawyer all in the same movie \? about the only character the production is lacking is sherlock holmes the action and special effects in this movie are outstanding as are the performances from most of the actors the only real drawback is the length about 30 minutes could be excised from this movie without deleting any key scenes all in all a good popcorn flick	12

1	jack london needs to be given his proper due he is a tremendously talented writer and his understanding of life matches his tremendous knowledge of the snow enshrouded world of the upper latitudes although the call of the wild is a short novel and on the surface a dog 's story it contains as much truth and reality of man 's own struggles as that which can be sifted from the life 's work of many other respected authors jack london 's writing is beautiful poignant and powerful yet also somber morose and infinitely real london does n't paint pretty picture nor is the story elevating or uplifting as an animal lover i found parts of this story heartbreaking from buck 's removal from the civilized southland in which he reigned supreme among his animal kin to the brutal cold and even more brutal machinations of hard weathered men who literally beat him and whipped him full of lashes even sadder are the stories of the dogs that fill the sled 's traces around him good spirited curly never had a chance while dave 's story is only made bearable because of his brave undying spirit even spitz the harsh taskmaster has to be pitied despite his harsh nature for the reader knows this harsh nature was forced upon him by man and his thirst for riches buck 's travails are long and hard but it is his nobility of his spirit that makes of him a hero despite the primitive animal instincts and urges that dominate him buck not only conquers the weather the harshness of the men the other dogs and the wolves he comes into contact with he thrives hopes for redemption with john thornton are dashed in the end and that 's when buck finally gives in fully to the call of the wild becoming a creature of nature only while this is a sad ending the reader also feels joy and satisfaction at buck 's refusal to surrender and his ability to find his own kind of happiness in the harsh world in which he is placed	12

0	for average people who want a camera that just works and takes good pics you should not buy this i do n't know about the specifics but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months so i do n't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it does n't even take a picture it was fine while it worked it ate batteries but the pics were good	12

0	i bought this for my mother a year ago and i was recently looking for a vacuum myself so being a person big on checking reviews on items before purchasing i asked her how she liked it she said she liked it and thought it worked well and loved how light it was \( she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis \) so needless to say i went out and purchased it trusting mother deartest 's opinion i hate it ! i just moved out of my house and i had to clean \( vacuum \) every room in the house it took three times the amount of time it would ave taken a regular heavy hoover vacuum to do the job one sweep for a normal heavy vacuum turns into thirty for this piece of s just to pick up some damn crumbs also you have to clean it out every five minutes because the filter gets covered so easily after only vacuuming about half a room it will not suck up hair rather it gets tangled in the wheel and looks like a thirty year old hairbrush that was never ever cleaned out hence making it harder and harder to pick things up \( not that it does to begin with \) it 's loud time consuming and the biggest waste of money the only thing it has going for it is its weight which is highly overshadowed by how much it sucks anyway oh and i 've used this product once once ! one time of use pretty much was all it was worth if that i'm taking it back and throwing it at them don't waste your money on this people ! !	12

1	i saw this back in 1985 when if first came out it was wonderful at first i thought it was going to be one of those historical tourist shows but it was n't it could have been though mr wood is a very charismatic presenter but is what 's better is that he took the story of the story of the trojan war from the pages of modern myth to reality i have read homer and i knew about schlieman but other than that i was ignorant of the trojan war mr wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level i was fascinated by the connection he made to the hittite empire the thought had never occurred to me that if a troy did exist it might have trade relations with empires to the east he also included experts in the fields of archeology modern history and history of the period i thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have seen it several times i also have the alexander dvd and shakepeare in search of shakespeare was fun wood took the story of shakespeare down to the center of his human story i would recommend all the wood in search of programs if you ca n't find the films then read the books the books are just are entertaining	12

0	for better or worse after the relative box office slump of on her majesty's secret service producers brocolli and saltzman decided to woo sean connery back to do one more film for an amazing sum connery who had said he would never do another bond film donated all of his money to his own foundation while his performance is competent and smooth as ever he seems all business no longer in love with the character and having realized long before that the character was stagnant connery mechanically works his way through diamonds are forever an outright bore of the bond series and in my opinion one of the worst \( certainly connery 's worst \) while some have tried to save the film by arguing that it is a parody of the bond genre it plainly is n't it was an attempt to return bond to his former glory days and generate profit for the producers far from trying to lampoon the bond formula the producers were trying to resuscitate it and they failed after the opening gun barrel sequence we quickly find bond on a personal mission to kill blofeld once and for all after the death of bond 's only true wife \( discounting the false marriage in you only live twice \) in on her majesty's secret service \( at least this is what we must assume since no mention of the marriage is made in diamonds are forever \) bond catches blofeld in the process of producing clones for himself in an underground laboratory and after a couple of struggles with both blofeld and a duplicate bond drowns blofeld in a vat of mud it is a very short and quick opening teaser and immediately runs into the titles sequence the titles involves various diamonds slowly revealed to be various pieces jewelry worn by beautiful women all set to the title song sung by shirley bassey \( who also sang the goldfinger title \) the plot of diamonds are forever is quite strange in an opening similar to goldfinger we learn that large quantities of south african diamonds have been smuggled recently and yet surprisingly have not made their way to the market worried that the diamonds will be released in order to inflate the diamond market bond is sent in to infiltrate the smuggling operation disguised as peter franks bond quickly succeeds meeting up with tiffany case \( jill st john \) an attractive diamond smuggler who is suspicious of bond 's identity bond 's mission is almost compromised from the start when the real peter franks makes an entrance forcing bond to fight him in a terrific elevator sequence that is reminiscent of the train fight in from russia with love after a smuggling attempt goes awry \( thanks to bond \) bond is discovered and learns of the real purpose of the operation he is infiltrating it turns out that blofeld is behind it all \( bond killed only two duplicates in the opening teaser \) ! blofeld has been smuggling diamonds to create a laser satellite that is capable of destroying anything on earth blofeld has been hiding his operation by posing as recluse willard whyte \( jimmy dean \) whom he has secretly kidnapped unbeknownst to the world and using whyte 's resources and industrial facilities to manufacture his powerful laser blofeld plans to destroy various nuclear installations in america russia and china the purpose \? blofeld is organizing an international auction offering nuclear supremacy to the highest bidder ! will bond be able to stop him in time \? diamonds are forever feels like a film that was stitched together rather poorly from a myriad of interesting elements one feels that the producers had a bunch of ideas on the cutting floor and attempted to piece them together into a logical story order the infiltration of a smuggling ring the wonderful fight sequence in the elevator the quirky and gay hitmen mr wint \( bruce glover \) and mr kidd \( putter smith \) a not so subtle rendition of the famous las vegas recluse howard hughes a fight on an oil rig et cetera all of these elements are fairly interesting in their own right but the combination does n't yield what the producers were hoping for what is it about this film that feels so ridiculous \? one of the major problems in my opinion is situating bond in las vegas bond in america is dull his class wit and sophistication are only cheapened when placed in the cheesy context of las vegas in the 1970s bond is supposed to take us to exotic locations not to a strip club furthermore the action is not quite on par with the rest of the series i think everyone will agree that the chase scene in which bond escapes through the desert on a moon buggy is absurd the chase is boring the buggy looks ridiculous and prop esque and there is no suspense the climactic fight on the oil rig is equally boring sure we have a big set and big explosions but there is no cutting edge stuff here connery as mentioned looks very tired here tiffany case is a bit refreshing but quickly becomes dim witted and dull and the bond girl with the clever name plenty o'toole \( lana wood \) is only in the film for all of five minutes blofeld is now played by charles gray who first made his appearance as bond 's japan contact in you only live twice gray 's performance takes blofeld back to the ridiculousness of you only live twice even appearing in drag at one point there is n't much more to say the acting is dead in diamonds are forever now some have tried to defend diamonds are forever by claiming that the film is an outright attempt to make a parody of the bond genre after producing six bond films the producers were ready to lampoon their own creation and move bond into the roger moore pun fest the series would eventually become while this certainly seems to create an outlet for the film it seems plainly false if you watch the making of documentary on the ultimate edition it is clear that everyone thought they were making a real bond flick and not a parody the producers were trying to bring the series back to its former glory days and to produce big box office success they were not trying to create a subtle piece that exposed the hilarious features of the bond formula anyone claiming otherwise is just engaging in wishful thinking and rationalization this film stinks let 's get over it ultimately i think you should skip diamonds are forever the only reason to see it is if you are a completist about the series and desire to watch them in order it is an awkward insert into the series during the transition between sean connery and roger moore the ultimate edition does have crisp picture and sound if you must struggle through the film make sure to get this edition because it is at least watchable but if you only desire to watch the better bond films skip it diamonds may be forever but this film died a long time ago	12

1	my legal ofice bought this product specifically for making unfillable pdf forms fillable this feature works much better than we expected i anticipated we would have to do a lot of clean up to make the forms useable that is not the case about 80 of the forms we run through it come out perfectly it seems to have trouble with forms that are really crowded with fields or have embedded fonts that we do n't have access to designing fillable forms from scratch used to take us hours for a simple form i could see most of the forms we use taking 6 8 hours each running it through the formtyper takes a few seconds the amount of time we save on this one task is tremendous we have also begin using the ocr capabilites to create digitial documents from our paper files the ocr seems to work really well even with multi generation copies we are very pleased with the performance of this product	12
0	given high acclaims this film has collected over time i was glad to pick up a vhs copy at my local library sale began to watch it last night i was able to sit thru the part 1 when the tape ended i was actually glad i felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1 ! the movie is dreary to the max people portrayed are irrational lost uncommunicative and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers in some way this movie reminded me of the dreary winter \( lasting 6 months ! \) i spent in russia a couple of years ago to me the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of soviet state \( 1920 1956 \) for survivors nothing made any sense anymore except perhaps fear and evil as people in this dreary film reflects people have been already destroyed in their souls they are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience maybe that is the real meaning of this movie to really reflect what happened to people 's psyche after lenin and stalin 's unlimited terror they found a parallel in mongol 's devastation and oppression of medieval russia in both cases people were left shattered helpless irrational withdrawn and autistic	12

1	i unlike a lot of other people did not buy this game when it first came out my initial thought was what was squar thinking i was thinking this could be nothing more than a childs game it wasnt until i talked to a number of other people right before kh2 came out did i finaly listen to all those people and spend the 20 to get the game \( as was the price of the game by then \) and low and behold by the time i finished watching just the opening scene i was hooked i played that game for what seemed like hours on in \( it was really only a very long weekend \) but that game became so addicting i immediatly went out and bought the second one the day it came out the story line was on par with that of final fantasy x and final fantasy vii my two favorit games in the world i would recomend this game to anyone with even the slightes bit of imagination if you can even dare to dream you will instantly love this game as i did it was well worth the price and my only regret is that i did not buy it sooner	12

1	quite different from his later big band recordings some of the songs that you may find on wes' 'best of' collections sound too much like elevator music not so with this debut album a drummer a organist and a guitar player no horn section stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing he shows of his trade mark octave playing his chord solos \( played over the organs rythm chords none the less \) and flashy runs across the fret board when needed a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz	12
0	the idea behind this toy is great ours has lived up to its durability claim my husband did not complain about adding songs to it so it could not have been too bad batteries this eats through them like crazy and we used duracell volume the idea of volume control is good but the highest volume is way too low i ca n't even hear anything until i get it to the mid setting my 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones we probably should not have bought this until next year maybe fisher price will have improved it by then	12
1	images from this camera are very high quality the 18x optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes the optical image stabilization system \( based on stabilizing the ccd image sensor instead of lens elements \) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances \( moving car boat shaky hands \) my main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed usb 2 0 support the fine print says that the usb interface is full speed which means a maximum transfer rate of 12 mbit s instead of the 480 mbit s possible with high speed usb so downloading photos from the camera through the usb interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a canon sd900 the software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive it would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the 4 aa batteries it uses but battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable nimh aa batteries was adequate	12

1	this may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch it 's big it 's ugly but has functions to make the fattest swiss army knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy overall i like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are the timepiece outstanding it has hh mm ss dd mmm of course with a year setting to avoid leap year issues this should go without saying in a modern digital watch stopwatch with lap function \( not that i ever use the lap function but i'm sure someone is interested \) countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown \( very easy to set \) three daily alarms special kudos for the alarms this is one of the loudest watch alarms i 've heard and i 've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this the altimeter largely eye candy but kind of neat over four days my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level \( by the maps about 40m asl \) not surprising because it is driven by the barometer and i never recalibrated it but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want need it the barometer yup it 's a barometer the part i like is the little display that shows the rising falling trend especially as this is always active \( even in normal 'time' mode \) the thermometer take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist the compass easily the best 'special' feature accurate precise \( enough for orienteering not for surveying \) easy to use it can be programmed for a declination but knowing me i 'd forget to reset it so i do declination the hard way the sighting notches are small but servicable the spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to suunto and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass an outstanding wrist compass the package big really really big but the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing \( a problem for me with other watches \) the battery has a shortish \( 12 18 month \) life but has a hatch so you do n't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance the display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground and the display light is just right readible even and glare free but not an emergency flashlight personally i'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap but the stock strap is n't bad just not great overall not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch compass and barometer and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter well designed thought out and manufactured but really big	12

0	i ca n't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie frankly i thought it was a dog not to say that it had no redeeming features the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing if improbable and the girl herself was a real sweetie and a good actress perfect for the part in fact the acting all around was admirable but the script ! yikes ! not a single character in the whole movie with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists had any motivation for anything they did people acting awkward or mean \( in fact just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean \) or spiteful or stupid for no reason at all ! it seems as though somehow the movie could have been good but did n't make it call it almost watchable i came away from lawn dogs \( yawn dogs \? \) feeling not at all enriched puzzled perhaps at why anyone would make such a movie well there was that admirable unlikely friendship but that was all pass this one by	12

0	at first it smells very sharp and citrusy almost like men 's cologne then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal after 15 minutes you wo n't be able to smell it at all very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag you 'd be better off buying a bottle of herbal essence shower gel and getting identical results	12

1	i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall i had recently watched quot secretary quot and i liked her so i bought it i'm not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue after buying my first flaunt magazine i wanted to buy more but needless to say the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time \( this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there	12
1	i am new to the world of gourmet salts and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago ! the granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel but that is where the similiarities end the salt dissolves instantly on the tongue it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste the jar suggests it be used on grilled fish and salads but i would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also	12
1	unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar ! no artificial sweetener aftertaste i like that it 's low fat and high in calcium plus the canister \( instead of individual packets \) lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference yummy on a cool day	12

1	i 've been a fan of this product for a couple of years since i have very long wavy hair it moisturizes really well and i use it every ten days or so it smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on kind of vinegary and spicy but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit it still smells unusual \( spicy and vaguely nutty \) but not unpleasant i warm a good handful of this in the microwave put it on my dry hair and tie it in a bun wait 20 minutes then shampoo it out using a liquid shampoo and condition with a light conditioner like coolaulin or a small amount of american cream if you have short hair you probably wo n't need this deep of a treatment but for those of us with a lot of hair or who have damaged or very thick hair it is great it makes my hair shiny and tangle free again it does n't have any of the silicones that commercial conditioners have so if you are looking for that slick feeling you get from pantene you wo n't find it here but the ingredients in this do n't build up in your hair the way silicones do so for those of us who are making a conscious choice to avoid silicone buildup in our hair this is a great deep conditioner	12

0	dark tort was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read but for a novel that 's supposed to be part of a quirky light mystery series i found things a bit leaden the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered and when we finally do move beyond that scene a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further i do admit that it also does n't help that i'm one of those people who ca n't suspend disbelief and have to ask so she 's an off site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified \? but that 's just me oh well many of the recipes did sound good though i doubt i 'll get around to making any of them this is one of those reviews where it 's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series \( which i personally have n't read but suspect are n't much different than this one \) you 'll likely enjoy this installment too the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b parker spenser novel for our light mystery fix	12

1	the amd ahtlon 64 venice processor is great installed into my new gigabyte mb without a hitch and runs very cool that will give up some room for future overclocking overall i would highly recommend the processor by applying for their credit card i received a really low price from amazon which was very surprising about 170 00 with free shipping and no tax everyone else was 200 230 for the same processor it is a great cpu at a good price from amazon	12
1	this is a classic in every sense of the word and like any real classic it gets better with age a charlie brown christmas is a sweet simple show with a powerful message every aspect of this production is great but the fact of the matter is that this is the kind of cartoon that does n't get made anymore now it 's all about the trash talkin' simpsons and their moronic kind also because god plays a part in the message of this christmas special it could not be made today it might offend believers in allah or hurt the sensitive feelings of atheists therefore such a production could never get off the ground it 's just as well there is really nothing that could suprass this masterpiece buy it and make it a part of your christmas traditions through the years	12

0	i would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball the roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out and you find yourself rolling it over over again to get a decent amount of gloss the gloss itself is pretty \( once you get enough on your lips \) and it does taste smell delicious but it is way too much trouble with the roller ball i would suggest they make this with an applicator brush it would make a great product	12

0	this stuff is supposed to help razor burn ingrown hairs honestly after all the time using it i ca n't honestly say if it works what i can say is that it smells terrible not a weak terrible smell but a strong overpowering stink it also burns like crazy when you put it on the tend skin company puts out this story about a miraculous discovery a dentists patient came to him after a tooth extraction and raved that whatever the anesthetic was that he was given it had cured his ingrown hairs well there are three ingredients in tend skin alcohol glycerin and aspirin thats it so apparently this dental patient had been cured of ingrown hairs by taking an aspirin bottom line is this product is insanely overpriced and they hide it with this distortion this silly propaganda about its miraculous discovery a little bottle of alcohol and aspirin should cost a tenth of this	12
0	the product would have been great but the store these came from sent the wrong sizes and did not respond to my emails on what to do to exchange them for the correct sizes i requested xl long pants they sent size 3x pants so they are completely unusable and do not respond to my emails i would never order from them again	13

0	communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history responsible for the extermination of 100 million people this book \( which started it all \) holds at least much of the blame communists were and still are a threat to the free world and communism is a slave system some intellectuals actually support the tired mantras of marx 's philosophy whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who have n't seen enough sunlight i do n't know in any case if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property and is totalitarian and slave driving \( the government owns everything including you \) and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up pol pot mao stalin \( of course \) etc etc who are these people kidding	13

1	la bamba \( 1987 \) the soundtrack to the ritchie valens biopic of the same name introduction in 1987 the film la bamba based on the life and times of fifties pop rock star ritchie valens was released the film cast lou diamond phillips as the classic musician and told his story from his rise to fame right down to his young and tragic death for the film los lobos a fairly popular act of the day was asked to rerecord classic valens material for the movie some other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for the film so how is the soundtrack \? read on and find out ! overview the la bamba soundtrack was released in 1987 around the same time as the film of the same name contributors to the soundtrack include los lobos howard huntsberry marshall crenshaw brian setzer and bo diddley the a side of the soundtrack sonsists of the los lobos covers of the ritchie valens songs la bamba come on lets go ooh my head we belong together framed and donna the b side consists of the other artists' covers which include howard huntsberry 's cover of jackie wilson 's lonely teardrops marshall crenshaw 's cover of buddy holly 's crying waiting hoping brian setzer 's cover of eddie cochran 's summertime blues bo diddley 's remake of his own classic tune who do you love and the two songs los lobos recorded for the film which were not remakes charlena and goodnight my love review awesome movie awesome soundtrack i'm a huge fan of the music of ritchie valens and for the most part la bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of the valens saga aside from some omitted material \( which i 'll get to later \) the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it represents read on for my reviews of the tracks side a la bamba by los lobos los lobos covers the track that took ritchie valens to the top of the musical world being a folk song no one ever thought a rock and roll version would do well valens proved the non believers wrong ! los lobos does a great cover of it too the band actually did two versions of the song for the movie a rendition of the slower folksier version by the bar band that convinced valens to cover the song himself as well as the classic version valens did this is the classic valens version i wish they had included both versions of the soundtrack though \( although an instrumental sequence near the end of this version does reprise elements of the folk type version still i wanted both versions as complete separate tracks ! \) come on lets go by los lobos this classic rockabilly style cut was another huge hit for ritchie valens los lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut staying true to the valens original while at the same time adding their own spin onto things all in all another great song ooh my head by los lobos not much to say about this one once again los lobos manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic valens tunes people know and love him for every song on this soundtrack is excellent and this one is no exception we belong together by los lobos ah the classic valens love song although its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad donna this one was still a fairly notable hit for valens the los lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one but i should n't have to tell you that now should i \? framed by los lobos of all of the ritchie valens song that los lobos revisited in la bamba this one is the least well known that 's a shame because it 's a great song ! the song takes a classic blues styling and puts a rockabilly spin on it once again los lobos does a marvelous cover version of the song donna by los lobos this song was so big a hit for ritchie valens initially that his only song even on the same plane of popularity is la bamba the classic ode valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff that has withstood the test of time and i know you 're probably getting tired of me saying this for every song but los lobos really does a good job on here side b lonely teardrops by howard huntsberry in la bamba howard huntsberry portrayed the classic soul singer jackie wilson and here huntsberry reprises wilson 's signature tune this is classic soul at its very best prior to seeing la bamba i had never even heard of huntsberry but the real shocker is that i ended up liking this version of the song more than the original ! definitely a solid underrated cut crying waiting hoping by marshall crenshaw marshall crenshaw a fairly popular eighties pop signer managed to land the role of buddy holly in la bamba holly of course was killed in the same plane crash that claimed the life of ritchie valens buddy holly is a tough guy to cover but marshall crenshaw does a damn good job of it i personally prefer this version over holly 's original \( and that 's saying a lot since i love buddy holly ! \) if you 're interested in hearing crenshaw cover another holly tune check out the remastered version of his 1982 self titled debut he covers rave on on there as a bonus track summertime blues by brian setzer long before brian setzer gained any real fame he played eddie cochran in la bamba covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend here 's another one of those covers that is so good i like it more than the original definitely worthwhile listening but then again is n't every song on here \? who do you love by bo diddley bo diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago and was asked to rerecord it for la bamba he did and the end results are solid diddley is a legend of the blues and this recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that way it just a shame that the version of this song most people remember is the george thorogood one because diddley 's version is the song the way it was meant to be heard charlena by los lobos in addition to the ritchie valens covers los lobos recorded two new songs for the la bamba soundtrack this is the first of the two essentially this here is a neo rockabilly track of sorts and a damn good one too long after the fifties music scene died out los lobos still managed to record a song that suited the style perfectly goodnight my love by los lobos here 's the second of the newly recorded los lobos songs done for the soundtrack what we have here is one of those classic fifties style rock ballads that were so popular back then if you 're into that sort of thing you 're going to love this song i know i do ! other comments omissions are the biggest problem with this soundtrack by far as i previously stated only one version of la bamba is on here not both versions from the film another omission is sleepwalk the classic santo and johnny instrumental that shows up frequently in the film its omission is likely due to the fact that it was n't recorded just for the film but still i miss it and then there 's the issue of rip it up the classic ritchie valens rockabilly tune he first plays with his band in their garage early on in the film this was one of my favorite songs in the film and i was devastated not to see it on here and where 's the big bopper 's chantilly lace \? i rated this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions if these songs had been on here it would be five stars all the way overall overall despite my issues with the omitted songs i am very satisfied with the la bamba soundtrack much like the movie it 's an excellent experience all the way through if you liked the movie or you 're just into this sort of music the soundtrack is well worth owning highly recommended ! edition notes this soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on compact disc implying it may be very gradually going out of print take my advice if you want it just buy it online it 's the fastest easiest way to get it	13
0	i was under the impression that this was a literary magazine that would be full of fiction short stories essays book reviews and literary criticism instead i received a magazine that discusses political issues does the magazine know what it wants to be \? they recently released a special fiction issue on the newsstands why would they if they 're becoming a political magazine \? do they want to be a news political magazines such as time u s news world report and newsweek or do they want to be a literary magazine \? they 're doing a poor job of establishing themselves and drawing the line of what they want to be i regret subscribing because i felt mislead of course for the atlantic staff turning the magazine into a political direction will probably bring them more sales i do n't think that reading and literary magazines are dead by any means but the format needs to be revamped so that people will want to read it	13
0	this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing his book is mostly life stories and stupid ones at that some teeter the line of racism he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil fat black woman and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on race and besides that his 2 or 3 spells and such are old and tired and there is no self initiation for the type of voodoo he 's talking about i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help his title is also misleading because voodoo ussually refers to hoodoo and vodun ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one he 's just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life experiences are even worth tellin this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back ground to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about	13

1	i work for an university and my contract was due 2 months ago i decided to get this phone because my pda was already old and i needed something that would be efficient i got this smartphone almost 2 months ago and i just have good things to say about it first it is not as heavy as the last model \( 650 \) and also looks really cool second the interface is pretty easy to use and figure it out the phone is microsoft os based \( i used a palm device before \) so getting use to it took me a couple of days but not really a big issue the battery works really well and in spite of other reviews the life have been pretty great even when compared with my last phone \( a motorola \) in general i thinks is a pretty good buy and you cannot beat the price when cingular sells it for way more money than amazon i 'll definetively will buy from this website again	13
1	my son was over 2 before we introduced be videos there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons unlike some of the other be 's with random visuals here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons and no i did n't care for the commercial either	13
1	i cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection but it does have the right ingredients that most top rated sunscreens sunblocks use so it should be at least on par with them where this product really shines \( or doesn't shine \) is for people with combination oily skin i have tried many sunscreens and it 's so hard to find a sunscreen without moisturizers \( if you have oily skin that 's already your natural moisturizers \) i have even tried other neutrogena sunscreens that are supposed to be oil free and all that the result on my face \? after applying it i always shine \( which is not what i want \) this magnificent product however actually gives my face a nice matte finish and matte feel too ! it 's a pretty thick cream when you first apply it \( as opposed to other suncreens or other products that feel more like lotion \) but is almost immediately absorbed by the skin in 30 seconds there is no more greasy creamy feeling and in one minute if you feel your skin there 's a nice matte feel however and this is not the fault of the product after about 3 hours \( at least for me \) then i feel like the matte effect has worn off and my oily skin is again showing its oily nature still as far as suncreens go this is the best i have tried for my skin and i highly recommend it for people with combination oily skin btw this review is for the actual product i got which is spf 30 as of the time i am writing this review here in amazon they also offer an spf 45 version and cheaper too ! i do n't know the difference but i always go for the lower one \( in this case spf 30 \) because i theorize rightly or wrongly i do n't know that the lesser the spf the lesser the strength of the ingredients so maybe it 's better for sensitive skin \( \? \)	13

1	this item is br1500 which also called rs model vs the bx1500 called xs models external battery br24bp can be used for both br1500 and bx1500 the capability to connect external battery is great since that can help reduce the downtime when california experiencing rolling black in the summer there are basically 2 differences between the back ups rs \( br1500 \) and the back ups xs \( bx1500 \) models besides their names 1 the back ups rs models have both 1 line 2 wire phone fax modem data line protection and 10 100base t ethernet protection where as the back ups xs models only has 1 line 2 wire phone fax modem protection 2 the back ups rs models have both boost and trim as features of automatic voltage regulation \( avr \) where as the back ups xs only has boost when the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a back ups xs model it will only go to battery avr boost the ups is compensating for a low utility voltage while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low avr trim the ups is compensating for a high utility voltage while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high bx1500 does not have the avr trim feature when ac line voltage is higher than spec it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range please note this is called backup ups not the smart ups line backup ups does not produce pure sine wave when power lost it will take some milli seconds to switch over to battery power smart ups produces sine wave and the output ac was from dc source all the time when ac input lost the ac output will not have any interrupt for most computers the backup ups is good enough since the power supply inside pc always have capacitors that can hold for about 100ms or longer when backup ups switched over in about 20ms the computer will continue operates without much impact but for a v equipment this may be an issue especially the output is not pure sine wave i would not recommend use this ups for a v equipment	13

1	i bought this for my 4 1 2 yr old daughter for xmas and she was extremely impressed along with myself it 's exactly like the real thing just smaller ! very durable colorful and fun ! it 's great to use with the zapf creation dolls that tend to weigh more than a smaller baby doll b c the car seat is so sturdy unlike most car seats this does n't collapse and fold up whenever you actually try to carry it by the handle ! it is definately worth the price	13
1	purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews i have found the basket to work great you put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces very easy with rock cornish game hens though i needed to tie them a little bit but that is because the little legs are well little never had one before just the skewer kind cleans fairly easy too love it	13
1	i tried one of the seidio shield holsters but it kept falling off my belt when i got in and out of my car the clip just would n't grip my belt securely enough i gave up after the 3rd time my treo 650 hit the concrete most of the time i just slip the thing in my left pocket but that does n't work so well with some pants especially jeans i decided to try the treo leather case and i like it quite a bit the clip is strong and i find it easy to get the phone in and out of the case	13

0	some of the songs here are good most notably never be forgotten beautiful i heard this song on the radio and i thought it was faith hill or martina mcbride singing herein lies the problem the song is good the voice is good but if she sounds like faith or martina there 's no distinction to set her off from the rest of the pack out there add to this that this is mostly bubble gum pop and not country there 's really nothing that stands out here why are recording companies giving contracts to people who sound like everybody else out there \? that 's the question	13
0	i purchased this wipe warmer because i did n't want a warmer that heats all the wipes those cause the bottom wipes to dry out and thus be useless the top down warmer is supposed to heat only the top few wipes well this warmer only heated the top section of the top wipe that sticks out of the top of the box it did n't even heat the whole wipe ! i am returning the warmer it is a complete waste of money	13
1	as a classic seattle tea this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea when i drink this tea i am home again this tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of seattle in one cup this is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors you can sweeten this more if you like with stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness it is good with a touch of muscovado sugar from india tree or the rieme french vanilla syrup when i'm writing reviews and i get sleepy this teawakes me up the rebecca review	13

1	the end of the sands of time trilogy marks a successful return to the style and fun of prince of persia sands of time the two thrones combines the good fighting mechanics of warrior within \( ww \) with the downright utter enjoyment that the sands of time \( sot \) started two years ago the story picks up where ww left off with the prince returning home to babylon before you know it the sands of time make a comeback and the prince is left in peril in order to save his kingdom all the great platforming tasks of insane jumps and crazy obstacles are here as are most of the sand powers found in the first two iterations gameplay is the same for the most part the new speed kill system is quite fun but some may find it eases the fighting difficulty quite a bit that being said its not always the easiest thing to pull off especially when multiple enemies are involved but a cool addition none the less the graphics look better than ever a slight improvement over ww and a remarkable improvement over sot which was jaw dropping only two years ago the rendered cut scenes look good and the sound is clear including all the voice acting where the original actor from sot has returned to voice the prince he does a great job again and really adds to the overall quality of the game the music is a return to the orchestral sounds of eastern decent and the hard rock has left the building to much acclaim this game is very linear which some people may stray away from there is no multiple back tracking like ww however it is enjoyable from start to finish even the new chariot races are interesting but some may find them slightly out of place there is one boss fight in particular that will cause many frustrating moments to all after a few times \( or perhaps dozens \) studying the patterns and getting your attack down it becomes no problem i did experience one glitch that caused my game to freeze at a certain point several times after searching around on message boards it seems to be a common problem i was able to get past it after resaving over the save point file a word of advice have at least a few different save files along the journey so you do n't have to start over at anytime the ending is completely appropriate to the trilogy and leaves you hoping the prince will one day return this game is a little on the short side at around 7 8 hours for me to complete it seemed shorter than the previous two all in all a great game a must play for anyone who enjoyed the previous two or for fans of third person action adventure you owe it to yourself to play the first two beforehand though if only to see the story from beginning to end and to experience one epic adventure	13

1	the first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it 's almost impossible to say one is better that the others taken together they are almost like one long album the family that plays together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first randy california 's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well one thing that differd spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert i saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me it 's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later ed cassidy randy california version not that the later versions of the band were n't great they just were n't quite as good as the original band if your'e just being introduced to spirit the family that plays together is a fine place to start	13

1	singer had the best male body bar none i have ever seen in films and it is really the star of this one right behind the two ferrets beastmaster 's friends most of the camera angles enhance singer 's musculature he has learned how to stand and move to best advantage for the cameras he 's not handsome though which does n't really matter in this film the film is fun action packed and pretty to watch while tanya roberts in her rather small role is nice to look at she cannot act her way out of a paper bag but manages to lend another perfect body to the cast rip torn the evil one barely suppresses a guffaw at the lines he has to say but pulls it off nonetheless the plot is good beastmaster \( singer \) is ripped from his mother 's womb before birth placed by occult means into the womb of an ox \( cow \? \) and is then ripped out again at knifepoint as a result somehow he is able to communicate nonverbally with animals and they are his helpers an eagle a black leopard and two ferrets on his way to avenge his mother 's death for what it is \( bad acting beautiful people and an unusual plot \) it deserves the cult following it 's got after all cult movies do n't always become so by being great works of art buy it just for fun suspend your incredulity for an evening and just enjoy it	13
0	microsoft office can be handy to have the files you can open edit and create with it \( most notably doc xls and ppt \) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options it 's \( relatively \) intuitive it has a pretty broad array of useful functions it 's also obscenely expensive considering the fact that you can get all of these things doc xls and ppt intuitive interface and functionality for free i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers make basic presentations or put together spreadsheets i was looking for basic functionality but i was pleasantly surprised openoffice does most of the neat tricks too \( actually it has a neat trick microsoft can never replicate it 's open source so it can respond to the needs of individual users you just say add this neat trick ! and someone will likely be able to do it for you \) it is possible that microsoft office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that openoffice does n't but considering the price differential i would n't splurge on this before checking	13

1	i 've had a treo 650 for a long time i was n't 100 sure i 'd want the 680 when it was first announced but a big nasty scratch on my 650 's screen helped me decide to take the plunge i'm so glad i did the lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better the internal slot for the sim card eliminates my worry that it might get lost and the covered sd card slot is very welcome because the darned thing always popped out in my 650 the only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button to reset the 680 you have to take out the battery that 's not a big deal since even on the 650 you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch what 's better on the 650 \? the main thing for me is that the cell phone 's radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb sd cards \( sdhc \) i use this phone for everything since it 's also a great palm organizer in addition to that i 've installed a registered version of pocket tunes so it 's a very good mp3 player it 's even compatible with playsforsure if you 're into that that 's why i'm so happy to see the 8gb support i also use the phone to play games like monopoly and scrabble when i'm waiting on line or in a boring meeting i have absolutely zero complaints about this phone	13
0	almost 10 years later and i am still waiting for the punchline i think this is the most properly named album of all time as the easiest summation is it lacks any punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes ! its terrible especially when contrasted with pornograffitti gone are the great guitar tone riffing rhythm power and groove that marked most of the prior three albums it 's what the forth side to iii sides to every story could have been yours mine the truth and the suck the songs are lackluster but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album no respect surprisingly by name is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album waiting for the punchline still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time i dont write negative reviews unless a cd is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work in this case it fits both its bad for extreme and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well conversely in my opinion iii sides and pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums respectively	13
1	despite what the other reviewer has said this table is great i delpoyed to iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems the table is lightweight and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly i use it for my laptop indoors but outdoors it works great as well \( provided a hurricane is n't trying to blow it around \) overall it 's a great table that 's compact and easy to set up and break down my only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams i 'd buy another if i had the need for one and everyone in iraq has complimented me on it because they 're stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on	13

1	being part irish and born 3 days after st patricks day hence my name i was lucky enough to find this item at amazon com and it is a top class item with a good finish the ring seems to keep it 's shine with no maintanence required as usual the service and delivery at amazon com is second to none as an american living in australia there are so many things i ca n't get in this country which is why i get things like jewelry from them could n't be happier with this ring	13
1	i bought version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features a tech at my isp \( bellsouth \) recommended this software to me i recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running windows xp pro installation was a snap updates are frequent and install quickly with my dsl connection the software suite has in my opinion more and better features than norton pro which i use on my desktop i really like the registry cleaner \( fixer \) and the defrag tools \( they use trend micro for virus protection \) the program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system there is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that i did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them however my personal experience after installing just the system suit 6 professional has really been good for me i bought my copy from walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and i received my rebate after about 6 weeks i hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results i would rate my knowledge of computers as above average which may be why i did not have any problems with the software	13

1	this is the perfect little tv dvd for a little girl 's room ! the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands \( volume channel change \) my daughter age 4 loves it i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny very close together i can barely read what each button does because the labels print is also very tiny this is annoying when in my daughter 's darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you ca n't eject or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode in other words when i go to put in a dvd i ca n't just push open nothing will happen you have to find the right button choose dvd from a choice of 3 4 things and only then will the tray slide open all in all these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again although it would be nice if they did come out w a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons symbols for a small child to recognize one great thing i want to point out there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards \( something not all dvd players offer \) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre movie ads you can ff right to the beginning of the movie ! ! !	13

1	the title of this movie holds no secrets the virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic between the acting and a great story line but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions	13

1	i totally disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny ! i do n't know what they 're smelling but obviously it 's not this it does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in but it certainly does n't smell like any granny i 've ever smelled i always get compliments when i wear this fragrance \( which is every day \) complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good i smell i recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance \( 1 spray should do the trick \)	13

1	i am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss i own over 300 different brands of gloss and this is by far one of my favorites it 's a pretty good deal at only 28 for so many colors i like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket it 's fun to layer the different colors as well and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors they also taste amazing each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar it goes especially well with the aquolina pink sugar fragrance for a sugar themed cosmetic experience	13
1	i bought this after using other murad products and loving them i like this but i would n't say i love it first it 's a bit overpriced i can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price the toner itself is decent but does n't seem to clean as deeply as other toners however for those who find toners to be a bit harsh this may be a good option non drying and does n't have that toner burn overall a decent product but not one i am sure i would re purchase	13
0	'clownhouse' is mainly associated with a sex scandal involving the director and the youngest boy actor while hearing of salva 's conviction when 'jeepers creepers' came out i never knew it had anything to do with this movie nor had i ever heard of this in the first place i actually stumbled upon this looking to see if there was a horror movie involving clowns besides 'it' and came across this weird little 'halloween' like suspense tale while the sex scandal never once popped into my head \( except when there was a pointless and gratuitous butt shot of the kid \) i still did n't care for this too much despite its pluses like 'halloween' this film relies on suspense rather than gore to creep people out but sadly it did n't really get to me if i was about 9 or so this would 've scared the hell out of me i'm not saying i hated this it was all right and had some geniune chills and some fantastic images but because you see who the clowns are before they find the house and start terrorizing the children it lost some effect for me i would have liked it better if i had no idea what was going on and it would 've been a creepier experience horror movie fans should like this even though i personally thought it would be better the atmosphere is very very creepy and the clowns are actually pretty terrifying in their own way but it just did n't do it for me rent it first	13

1	fable has reached the point where all rpgs dream of going it 's absolutely the pinnacle of the adventure criteria the creators put you in the game they make it fun and they make it interesting fable is the game that absolutely defines the whole light side dark side thing because no other game concentrates on the subtle small important details and leisures quite like fable does people will learn to adore you and people will learn to fear you you have a life you 're not just some dummy on a string being instructed on exactly what to do you hear that \? fable is life it 's adventure with a hint of unrealism just to the point to make you eternally amused to never decease until the fat lady sings battle system 9 it 's not guns it 's not shoot'em up blowing their brains out it 's classic swordsplay and acrobatics blocking stabbing leaping lunging ducking dodging running away nothing to say except 'die' not to mention you can eat pie and it 's all realistic hitting someone in the back the head the torso all cause different amounts of damage there 's decapitations if you 're lucky and the game even keeps track of your decapititations how cool is that \? there 's archery shoot someone with and arrow the further you pull back your arrow the more damage it does but the less accurate it is you see \? realism plain clear and simple just like the drive thru guy ordered leisure and life 9 flirt with chicks flirt with guys \( eww \) flirt with chickens whatever flirt with anything with a face get a special haircut facial hair tatoos some chicks find them attractive some scary some may think you 're michael jackson with a sword and get the heck away from you hey that 's life right \? one of the first games ever to allow you to get married to any woman \( or man \) and actually have sexual intercourse with them yep you heard me sex do n't get cought up on the kinkiness boys it lasts for 5 seconds when the screen goes blank it 's only for crickets and giggles buy a house rent out your house live in your house steal from anyone kill anyone picklock doors fish dig kick chickens abuse your wife whatever you wanna do you can probably do it in fable main adventure 10 yes this game is not all just chicken kicking there is a plot filled with with surprises cliff hangers and ultimate rewards gameplay 4 quite possibly the only downside to this game it 's too easy i completed the game naked and did n't die once there is no way to change your difficulty this does however make the game much more fun as you do n't have to reload and just get lucky in order to defeat an enemy but in all sincerity you may very well just whiz your way past this game in mere hours if you put your mind to it but then again that is why i am thankful for all the bonus material in the game because the actual game itself can go by pretty fast it may seem confusing and hard to get at first but all rpgs do so just stick with it	13

1	veronica mars is my favorite show currently on television although the show has been focusing more on veronica 's romantic relationship than in the past the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode the writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show the acting for the most part is top notch and kristen bell who plays veronica is amazing i especially enjoyed episode 9 spit and eggs in which veronica figures out who has raped her fried parker and at least two other women on her campus	13

1	i bought this to hold some of my overflow knives that would not fit into my knife block it has proven to be very handy it seems well made im not expecting miracles from a knife tray so that doesnt really say a lot but it is sturdy and nice looking it occupies about half of a drawer which leaves plenty of room for the rest of the non sharp cooking utincils to sit next to it i have now switched its intended purpose slightly insead of just holding the overflow from my counter top knife block this now holds my most commonly used knives the real knife block now sits farther away in the corner occupying the overflow from this one	13
1	sometimes i like to look up and see what i can find on some of my favorite bands from the 70 's and starz being one of them i was lucky enough to see the band play a few times around 77 and 78 another band that took time for their fans ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i read through the many reviews of posted here on amazon and not sure if there is much that i can add also great to see that there were so many out there that enjoyed the band and their music i would recommend reading about each of the starz cd 's and listening to the sound files if available and deciding for yourself i remember i liked this cd so much and the logo as well i even hand made a stencil and made my own starz shirt i think i used some of that gold glue on glitter in a tube and had one of the first starz shirts before the band even had any if i remember right lots of good songs on this cd pull the plug being one of my favorites both on the lp cd and live all good rock songs from a band that deserved a lot more i could go on trying to describe the music too bad there are no sound files for this cd so you may just have to order it and take a chance the remaining members have played a few shows during the past year or so and guitar player richie ranno continues to be active in the music business you may even want to go over to starzcentral to get updated and see what richie and the band are up to singer michael lee smith also had a brother that had his own band and later ventured into hollywood but this is about starz ! ! ! so i highly recommend checking out the cd 's and starzcentral not to be confused with the movie channel or another band from europe that is using the name recently	13
1	this bin is great for cloth diapers we love ours keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two 's worth of diapers which is all i need because we wash every other day our local babies r us sells replacement deodisks \( or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors \) when the one that comes with it loses it 's smell so that you can maintain freshness it 's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive	13
0	my last roxio product was easy cd creator 5 when i switched to a mac i naturally expected toast to be the mac version of this product i am extremely disappointed to find that the crippled video editing features in my \( many years old \) version of cd creator is miles ahead of what they include with the most current and up to date version of toast which i unfortunately own it allowed me to edit video clips create several levels of customizable menus customize the size of compression and burn to a dvd which played on my standard dvd player toast can create one uncustomizable menu level has no editing and locks up every time you drag a file into it they \( in the product description \) say it reads mpegs but it 's more like it freezes every time it sees an mpeg it does n't even read every mpeg reliably the only thing i can find that roxio adds to toast that is n't in my old version of cd creator is more enhanced mp3 and music features \( which is n't what i bought it for \) i may have been better off using parallels in combination with cd creator i am sorry but compared to roxio 's cd creator \( which is basically the same price \) toast seems to have been designed by total idiots and i always thought that mac software was better for working with multimedia	13
0	we were so excited to try a jumper for our son but were very dissapointed in this product first of all he tipped himself right out of it ! with the three strap design it 's unsturdy in the back which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor he seemed pretty intent on jumping so now we 've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he 's nice and snug but it 's still unstable and wobbly i do n't recommend this product and in fact we are going to try a different brand	13

0	even though i bought these for 9 99 i still somewhat regret it the quality of the jacket is really poor every parts of the jacket is poorly constructed from the pockets to the zippers while wearing it the jacket smells like paint or what they used to bleach the colors on i hope the smell gets out after washing i am a little concerned whether the colors will rub off easily when i wash it and onto my other clothes	13

0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	13
0	not even worth finishing this book ! this author does not know enough to even write this book ! i have personal connections with blackwater and i know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be it is a one sided story not based on facts which it what most writers do but purely fiction ! the only few misfortunes blackwater has had is what he bases his book on not the postive stories that i hear about everyday do n't waste your money	13

0	i bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts i usually lift weights have no prior injuries and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form \( i played a college sport etc \) after a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that i could barely move them regularly it was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier \( free weights included \) perhaps i was doing the exercises incorrectly but that seems like a real risk with a video like this	13

1	truth be told i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively when this thing gets going though the descent easily attains not to be missed status and on top of all the incredible special effects oppressive atmosphere and grievous bloodletting \( made with a pretty limited budget by the way \) one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner are you kidding me \? blood gore a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe and subtlety \? how could i not give the descent five stars \? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky extreme activity white water rafting for example everyone has fun but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women sarah \( shauna macdonald \) forever still recovering from her terrible loss sarah joins her friend beth \( alex reid \) in america where mutual friend juno \( natalie mendoza \) an alpha female if there ever was one has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored joining in the fun are holly \( nora jane noone \) juno 's new gung ho sidekick and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians \( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk \) then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure once they descend into the cave system though things start getting more intense fairly quickly their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses that 's when juno a woman with more than her fair share of secrets admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before supposedly to help reunite the group well it does just the opposite but they just have to keep going if there is a way out they 're going to have to find it the hard way things are already creepy enough at this point the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets making the viewer feel as if he she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic but the real fun was just about to begin in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them no one believes her at first when the crawlers attack though all hell breaks loose two miles under ground these gollum like creatures are some kind of blind albino humanoids who hunt by sound can scamper and climb like monkeys move unbelievably quickly and really tear into whatever flesh they can find not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light and when the girls fight back it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy bloody gruesome department and even as characters are fighting for their lives a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film for some pretty questionable reasons a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference do n't worry though as the dvd has both endings available the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears making it one of the most atmospheric heart pounding movies to come along in quite a while the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film and plenty more on top of that if you care the first thing about horror you must see this atmospheric tour de force	13

0	i'm a student in college and when my first hamper ripped i decided that it was time to buy a sturdier hamper my roommate rarely does his laundry so he has huge loads but his hamper manages to carry it all i saw the whitney design hamper online which looked nearly identical to my roommate 's hamper so i bought it when the hamper arrived i put my clothes in it and prepared to do laundry the shoulder strap ripped right off i did n't even fill up the hamper all the way as is shown in the picture amazon sent me a replacement but now i am afraid of using the shoulder strap again and i have to awkwardly grasp the sides around the metal wires this hamper may be able to function but not well and for a college student this is definitely not sturdy enough	13
1	five stars may be excessive if you judge this cd alongside the greatest classics but when compared to similar cds within the singer songwriter folk rock genre this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines i find myself coming back to this cd more often than to many better known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest the writing while occasionally a bit awkward is consistently interesting honest and moving the themes of introspection nostalgia regret and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner the song if i were a man is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world child of steel plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy and take my body is a strong lament about the objectification of women i especially love the pared down guitar arrangements the simplicity really works with ms cash 's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments i 've seen ms cash perform live and while she has other hits that may be more popular this collection reveals her unique brilliance	13
1	i love these crackers and was suprised to find them on amazon com i first found them in reading pa and here in florida could not find them high fiber is important to me and these have more than most	13
0	once thought of as a women 's health magazine cosmo has taken a twisted turn into pointless redundancy at one point cosmo seemed to be a must have along with water and oxygen more and more lately it seems that the magazine is posing the question how can we survive on only water and oxygen and still be sexy while we do \? ocassionally a featured article faces the issues of things ranging from eating disorders to politics but few and far between they do n't seem to realize that on the other side of the page for the eating disorder article is a woman who wears a size 0 and is still unsatisfied with herself thinking that she must conform to some heroin chic fad fun fearless female articles about real women who make a real difference is great it shines the spotlight on someone who not only is beautiful and successful but has enough education and talent to succeed in the world without needing a man if the magazine featured more of these things maybe it would be worth my subscription fee but tell me when the last time is that you saw a cover not featuring the phrases mind blowing sex how to satisfy \( insert breathing life form here \) or barely there which seems to refer to not just underwear anymore but everything this is n't a magazine about women 's health anymore it 's all about how to keep your man happy while still conforming to social standards in fashion weight and financial standings i'm sorry but the girl on a budget ca n't afford a 430 skirt or uncomfortable shoes with the uncomfortable price of 300 cater more to the real woman not the one who only cares about her relationship status pant size and bank account	13
0	flavor is just passable the cracker is too thick have not found a topping that will soften it	13
0	the magazine is very nice with color pictures and recipes that look okay but that ingredients are either rare or expensive the magazine is too fancy and it 's hard to find what the recipe is like they do n't put a review you have to tell for yourself and plus if it does n't have a picture you have to guess what 's in it i rate it one star i 'd rate it a half star if there was such thing but there is n't i would n't buy this magazine	13
0	this tray does not fit nicely inside the tool box grill it is about 2 inches short on the end and about a 1 2 inch too narrow this causes it to slide and bang around inside the grill when transported the tools have a very cheap feel to them the tongs were the worst the handles are loose and they are prety much useless the knife wo n't hold an edge the spatula and tongs are marginal i would not recommend this item	13
0	i was very disappointed in the taste of this item not at all what i expected from splenda it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor much too strong i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product without question !	13
1	this is a fantastic magazine what i really enjoy about it is how often the featured homes are ones with small kids they show it is possible to have great design that works well with young ones too it 's comfortable livable modern now if only we could find a way to import the products shown here to the u s !	13

0	he was at his best when he sang about the loneliness perseverance and dreams of ordinary people in sandra for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour the combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique in the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions he released a few inspired tracks now and then his first christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth and here at the mayflower was a sincere effort he is an intelligent person who cares for music and does n't let his superstardom go to his head so what has changed \? and why this late in his career \? barry has reinvented himself as a las vegas entertainer liberace style and he 's released an album with unchallenging versions of evergreens i have no doubt that he genuinely wants to make people happy like liberace did and i have deep respect for that but i personally regret that clive davis and manilow have now decided to manufacture products for a larger audience one that does n't really have any demands	13

0	yup definately the worst halloween movie come on michael on a reality show \? ha ! what the f k does that have to do with the series \? not only that but the plot is completely pointless the acting sucks and dr loomis and jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie ! not only that but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary and therefore comes off as pretentious do n't get me wrong i love gore in movies horror or not but any knowledgable halloween fan knows that the halloween movies were always scary without the gore along with halloween 3 \( which actually had nothing to do with michael \) halloween resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series there are a many more problems with the movie than the ones i listed but i'm tired of typing so i 'll let other reviewers explain why it 's so bad bottom line watch any halloween movie other than this or halloween 3	13

1	this is one of a series of horror anthology movies released by amicus studios in the early 70 's \( i e tales from the crypt the house that dripped blood vault of horror \) each anthology is held together by a certain theme in asylum a young psychiatrist interviewing for a job in an asylum is told that the head of the asylum has gone crazy and is now a patient the young psychiatrist must hear the stories of some of the patients and then determine who was the head of the asylum if he is correct he gets the job the stories give the feel of old horror comics which inspired many horror anthologies the characters are one dimensional and driven by such deadly sins as greed and lust in most cases with a twist and a touch of macabre the fates get their revenge on the evil doers the stories are mostly enjoyable and solid entries in the horror anthology genre the british countryside where the stories are mostly set adds an extra chill the movie is recommended most to fans of horror anthologies such as hbo 's tales from the crypt or stephen king 's creepshow and the movies noted earlier it would also be great for those who remember how much fun these movies were when they first came out more general audiences would be entertained but i do n't think this movie should be ranked with 5 star horror masterpieces \( the exorcist halloween psycho \) nor would i expect most general audiences to rank it so highly the dvd quality is definitely noteworthy having sharp rich colors which enhanced the movie 's experience	13
1	the azden transmitter receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews as an aspiring video maker it was a product i should have bought a long time ago mine is the 9v powered model not the aa but it has proven well made light and easy to use there 's something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit i find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise the din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information	13
0	the product was fine but i received an older version and as a result i could n't properly update it even after registering it as a result i purchased the newest version available directly from lavasoft and it works fine and i have had no trouble updating it why did n't you specify what version it was on your website then i could have made an informed decision \?	13

0	i had a pronto neo for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after i dropped it 1 5 feet onto a hardwood floor the unit has a very cheap feel especially for the price i was n't at all surprised when it stopped working the pc software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap the touchscreen is very tedious to customize \( i write software for a living and i still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen \) i ca n't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your pc to the remote the whole point of the pronto neo is that you can customize the touch screen unless you are very comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit aside from the touchscreen 's fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote did i mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months \? in short this product is crap i might consider buying another one if it sold for 30 or less	13

1	quite frankly this is the only cooking magazine i have ever subscribed to that i actually have looked forward to using and to receiving every two months i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! the format of the magazine makes it easy to follow the recipes they are always printed on two pages across from each other and unlike some of the other posters i prefer the black and white format so that the paper is thicker and does n't tear easily having tear away ads \( for their own products \) on the outside of the magazine means that the usable portion does n't take up much space on my shelf the recipes are easy to follow and usually clear when they include specialized ingredients there is usually also a substitution listed their product reviews are terrific i wish i had n't wasted so many dinners on bad whole wheat pasta my only gripe as someone who does not have a dishwasher is the great number of bowls and kitchen tools the recipes require i have made at least half the recipes from the magazines many several times which is no small feat for a flexitarian who never has meat as a main dish	13
1	this product fits my camera perfectly and is not at all bulky a great safeguard from falls and the velcro latch provides just enough security	13
1	this is a high quality pan with a nice heavy weight to it not at all flimsy i wanted to get one like my mom 's and this turned out to be less expensive but a much better quality and heavier weight i bought 2 of these along with 2 of the smaller cookie sheets as part of amazon 's 4 for 3 promotion and it only came to about 30 ! that is an incredible deal for stainless steel pans of this quality i would absolutely recommend these	13
0	great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost did n't finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira 's voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie	13
0	i was impatient to buy the successor of my beloved treo 650 and did so last january by upgrading to the treo 680 i have been a faithful customer of palm technology since 1997 and for the first time i am disappointed of course i still have the friendly palm os tailor made for smart phones i also have upgrade compatibility for my 15 000 records stored in the treo 's four main applications but the minuscule battery of the 680 forces me to curtail versamail sync and phone conversations and its clumsy command bar results in unexpected commands \( contrary to the 650 buttons are too close to each other \) reliability of the 680 is also left to be desired especially compared with the 650 after firmware update finally i use intellisync for dual sync with both user friendly palm desktop and heavy duty email ms outlook the acquisition of pumatech by nokia results in a clumsy new release of intellisync for treo intellisync new version added a record number in the note field of all my records ! i quickly reverted to an older intellisync version and i wonder what will happen when i need to upgrade with ms office 2007 compatibility nokia 's low blow to palm \? it is time palm responds with a decent dual sync solution of their own if not it 's decided i will switch to the pearl	13

0	i do n't know what the last poster was thinking this dvd goes to the top of my worst quality list i would n't complain as much but they are advertized as quot digitally remastered quot which is obviously meaningless quot long john silver quot is soft focus borderline blurry throughout marred with constant flecks and blobs and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image it 's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk have n't viewed quot captain kidd quot but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition if that 's the best the films come and there 's no money for clean up so be it but get that misleading quot digitally remastered quot off the box that 's a hoodwink if ever there was one	13
0	perhaps if i had n't already had a different type of bunting i would n't be so disappointed with this one my sister loaned me her eddie bauer bunting when my son was born she will be having her next baby any week now so i had to return it to her which meant i had to buy a new one i saw nothing but great reviews on this product so i picked one up first of all i followed the washing instructions washing it separately on delicate and drying it on low and it ripped at the one seam ! ! based on that alone i will be returning it aside from that having used a bunting with a different design i am not thrilled with this one part of the point of using a bunting is so that when you 're in a car where you have heat you can open up the bunting on a longer drive so baby does n't overheat this bunting zips down both sides to the bottom \( by the way zipping unzipping is tricky with a baby kicking around the zipper gets stuck in the material a lot \) rather than down the middle front \( that style zipper was never a problem \) then you have this thick cover at baby 's feet and nowhere to go with it as the bottom of the carseat is up against the back seat of the car ! so you either have to rig it so it is up the back of the seat and tucked under the headrest or you have to leave it on baby 's legs also the top of this bunting does fold over so that baby 's face is n't covered unless you want it to be but my 5 month old has no problem picking it up and pulling it up over his own face he did it this morning on the way to daycare this bunting is too thick for me to feel comfortable with him doing that and i ca n't be reaching in the back seat to pull it down off his face ! there is no disputing that the concept of a bunting is great and that this particular bunting is toasty warm it is wonderful being able to put the baby in his carseat and strap him in safely w out a snowsuit being in the way or having to bundle him up before going out and unbundle him every time you get to your destination but i do n't think the design of the urban bundle me is great and i actually think this bunting is too warm \( even with the bunting open on a long car ride the other day my son 's back was all sweaty when we took him out of the carseat \) after calling several stores and looking at all my options at babies 'r' us i ended up ordering a new eddie bauer all season bunting from target com \( which cost less than 20 including shipping \) i ca n't wait till it gets here i will be returning the 60 urban bundle me as soon as i can	13

0	i bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews big mistake ! the cardio boot camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing the beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun if i knew what was n't included i would n't have bought it they should list what 's not included in the description it seems somewhat deceptive	13
0	i quite liked this trimmer while it worked well so i'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months as of now the battery will hold barely any charge if at all it 's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions	13
1	great buy for 20 bucks they look nice and fit well they are distressed but it is not as bad as i thought it would be from reading the other reviews they look nice with jeans and a dark shirt pretty comfy too	13
1	i 've been waiting for this technology for years so when i found out jvc was planning on coming out with their 4 gb microdrive version i had to have one the 1500 price tag was too much though then i found out the gz mg50 was coming out and would be about a 1000 i thought it was still a little pricey but i could n't wait any longer so far the camera has performed great it 's been easy to use and easy to transfer the files to my computer then to dvd however the video editing software that came with it seems a bit cheap but it gets the job done maybe the next gen version will be an improvement the movie quality is very good i wo n't give it a great because i occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned dvds do n't bother taking pictures with this unless you only plan on emailing them the quality is far too low to use to capture those precious moments i recommend getting an additional battery \( the three hour model \) the one hour battery just does n't cut it especially if you want to review your scenes while you 're out shooting if jvc gave the camcorder a larger ccd and included better software i would have given this a 5 star rating otherwise i think they are on the right track and in a few years the minidv may be as forgotten as the eight track	13

1	ncaa football 2006 captures the college atmosphere extremely well the game is loads of fun the load times are decent the dynasty mode adds tremendous replay value the quest for the heisman is a pseudo ripoff of nfl 2k series crib feature i still love this game i even like the music it does n't bother me that lee corso 's and kirk herbstreit 's commentary is repetitive the only thing i take issue with is every year ea brags about the strength of the ai and yet you can run the option successfully hundreds of times while the computer controlled team struggles to find a defense capable of stopping you maybe that is why some people prefer to play online opponents let me wrap up this a great game the graphics are impressive and ea did a wonderful job here buy it for your son buy it for your daughter or buy for yourself you will love it i wish i could provide a more helpful review head on over to and read the wonderful review they gave this game that will be more helpful than anything i can contribute	13
0	these watches sounded like a good deal given the original price i ordered two one for myself and one for my brother they arrived today and both could not be set that is the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out they were both stuck in the case so tight i broke a nail in the attempt and i agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless they go back tomorrow	13

0	because that 's all this magazine is an advertising vehicle aimed at kids who are n't old enough to discriminate between ads and actual content yet do n't be fooled by the venerable national geographic name this publications pays only the briefest lip service to educational content when my son received it as a gift i was shocked to see that the ads were virtually indistiguishable from the articles and in fact the ads were often much more visually interesting the photos were excellent i must admit but the layout was jazzed up to the point of absurdity as if designed to play to kids with minuscule attention spans the science facts were sound but again the articles were cut absurdly short more like squibs and factoids than actual articles as if the editors believe that kids could n't possibly focus on one topic long enough to actually read more than 250 words about it or maybe because they did n't want to distract the kids from all that tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page as an editor and a parent i am appalled by this magazine and would not recommend it to anyone national geographic should be ashamed of itself for pushing this kind of junk on young readers avoid this publication like the plague	13
0	i'm not a big fan of bruce campell but i was appalled while viewing this film i know it 's a b horror film but there was no orginality in this movie i know it 's suppose to be funny but come on people was it really \? the only part that was slightly funny was when campell 's wife was going after the gypsy for the first time needless to say i think it 's interesting that this movie was a book going off subject however on a late night talk show bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a pg 13 horror film i 'll conform with that	13
1	i got a free sample of this product at a nordstroms trend show and decided to use it the other day my hair is pretty course and frizzy and long but it is also more kinky curls instead of big round ringlets well i let my hair air dry then applied a serum to take care of the frizz then i put some in my hair \( you do n't need much \) and scrunched and twisted my hair it worked wonderfully ! my hair was bouncy and had lots of volume and was very shiny and curly the best i have ever seen it ! i got a lot of compliments on it too the only thing is that if you use too much your hair gets too shiny and looks oily also it doesnt have much hold at all so a good hair spray really does the trick with this besides that it is a wonderful curl enhancer	13
1	this is one of the nicest tea assortments to keep on hand for yourself or visitors awake is a great quality sweet black assam tea by sweet i mean it is not too astringent or bitter calm is a chamomile lavender blend very distinctivethere is a green tea a mint and other flavors that will please nearly anyone you can try these teas to see what are your favorites \( the fine earl grey \? \) and this is also great to keep in your office or home for treating guests to whatever tea they may prefer	13

0	with as many big names in this i thought it would be amazing well it is a corn ball adventure its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and poses ! ! \( shakes head \) its things like this that really hurt the film for many kung fu hong kong film fans i really wanted to like this film but could n't get past the ridiculousness of it now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish	13
1	i bought a pair of these in tortoise and really love them ! they fit great they arrived in great condition and very quickly the rhinestones are really blingy in the sun ! i am buying a pair in black for my best friend who is in love with them also very cute for the price	13
1	previous hulk games have n't been quite up to par with other superhero franchises featuring tedious bruce banner stealth bits instead of placing the emphasis where it should be smashing stuff and having that stuff smash up real good fortunately that is n't a problem with the latest installment this game is all about creating as much destruction as possible in any way you see fit be it ripping a car in two to make hulk sized novelty hulk hands using a truck as a shield or fashioning a boulder into the world 's largest bowling ball not only that but hulk has a large variety of moves that give the player a lot of options for combat i ca n't really comment on the story since i skipped it i 've never been the biggest fan of the green machine 's mythos and backstory so i suppose your mileage might vary but not that much thanks to flat as cardboard voice acting all in all this game really makes you feel like you 're in control of a gargantuan green goliath the boss fights are especially great when you go against a giant hulk busting robot that levels entire city blocks with each laser sweep you know you 're having fun unfortunately the game drags with the repetitious combination of escort destroy and fetch story missions i can appreciate that banner wants to return himself to normal but destroying an entire building just to snatch a cat scan \? that 's a little lame plus you 'll be right at the end of a mission when a bevy of hulk seeking missiles and hulk crushing mechs always seem to show up and gun you down even poor greenie ca n't do much when he 's being wailed on from all sides bottom line probably the best superhero game of this console generation hulk smash	13
1	we canoe kayak down various rivers and creeks i wanted a way to take my 1500 camera on the water without fear of damaging it the sports pack is completely water proof \( up to 7m \) i 've submersed the case in a test and in a real life situation and the camera stayed dry the case does not cause any noticeable reduction in picture quality it is relatively simple to operate and assemble you have only the basic functions of the camera while in the case so you need to change any setting for the camera before putting it in the case and advanced camera features are not able to be used my only concern is the scratch resistance of the plastic over the lens area so far i have n't had any problems but i 've only taken on the river for about 30 hrs all told i'm very pleased and if you plan on filming in or near water i would recommend this case	13
1	solid construction good optics nice sound as mentioned by others the output for the usb transfer is found in the handycam console and not the camera itself a minor annoyance all in all this is a good camera that is touch pricy but you do get what you pay for	13
0	i forced myself to finish this book before i reviewed it and being through with it now i feel as though i 've learned very little i had so many problems with this book or rather the way of writing mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author that this was a difficult read in his defense he is in most things very thorough my main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what leonardo was \( or as he sometimes put it quot must have been quot \) thinking or feeling while i give mr bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject in my opinion that still gives him no right to use what i understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views since he himself stresses that leonardo 's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations in the instances that there is a controversy over some area of leonardo 's life the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter but only puts forward his own opinion and his reasons why he believes what he does without explaining the opposite side of the matter in this manner he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter sentences beginning with quot i think quot or quot in my view quot are not uncommon he also makes certain assumptions about the reader referring often to other artists' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them also he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of leonardo 's often drawing attention to coloring or texture without ever showing it though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout the author is an undoubtedly intelligent well learned man very erudite where leonardo da vinci is concerned but entirely overbearing in his writing overall unless you are well versed in the renaissance artists and do n't mind being pulled out of a book by the author 's views then i would highly suggest staying away from this one	13
1	this product does what it claims it will do put in the time and effort you 'll feel great ! of course i do n't ever expect to look like the model on the box however i feel good and i think i look a little better than when i started only doing it a few weeks but enjoying it	13
0	i wanted to like this book i enjoyed the first two in the series but this one left me a bit dry babylon rising the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips this continues the story of michael murphy a college professor teaching biblical archaeology he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of the handwriting on the wall from the days of daniel he 's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him and there are a few attempts on his life mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon murphy for someone who 's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean finds himself in the middle of all this as i said i really wanted to like this book the murphy character is likeable and i enjoyed the action but the plotline was spotty and over the top murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him \( highly unlikely \) everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time \( over the top \) the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel and they did n't do either one especially well murphy 's growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the she 's so beautiful and could she be interested in me interludes and finally none of the plotlines wrapped up you got to the end and thought so \? fine if you 're ready to read the next installment but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one part of me wants to be nice give the book the benefit of the doubt and rate it a 3 but the authors are better than this and i 've come to expect more from someone who 's been doing this for a long time if you 're committed to the series you 'll want have need to read it but just do n't come in with your expectations very high	13
0	i bought this product from a nearby retailer the packaging is deceptive the photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer the battery is 35 00 with shipping and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring this frame has no on board memory so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts this is an additional expense after purchasing the photoframe i discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should i took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before i found one which had an unbroken frame i took that photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described i then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device \( the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer \) with the retailer 's very helpful clerks i tested three more photoco photoframe devices none of them worked as described \( they would not scroll through and album of photos \) i returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device then by email i requested a refund for the price of the battery photoco replied that if i sent them the battery they would refund its price i mailed the battery on may 6 and then inquired about my refund on may 14 photoco replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick on 3 17 i sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund photoco said that my credit had been processed but that i might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days i still have not received my credit for the battery if you want to avoid a headach avoid doing business with this company read the other reviews before considering this product	13
1	love letters has a very simple concept two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage they never look at each other but within these letters is so much humor love and truth that the play will carry you away with delight i read this play as i was browsing through a bookstore i just wanted to read the first couple of pages since i 'd heard so much about it after page three i did n't want to put it down now i'm buying it for a friend do n't think this play is a sappy collection of gushy girl talk or even romance novel fodder if you have ever been in love you will recognize parts of yourself in this it always stays true to its well drawn characters which is what makes the end so heartbreakingly wonderful	13
0	for the price i should n't complain but what the heck \? what ever happened to quality control \? it came double shrink wrapped there was a plastic handle guard that did n't fit the sword so i had to just throw it away very little pride in the product the wood was roughly sanded before it was painted well it 's just a stick afterall i'm just glad i did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor dreamobjects read their feedback responses sounds a lot like aggressive ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback sorry waste of my time and a few dollars i gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you ca n't tell quality from a single digital photo	13
1	i bought this for my grandmother who cooks for two it is small and compact enough to put in your cabinets and does n't take a lot of counter space while you are using it its the perfect size to make pancakes eggs and bacon ! we used it to make grilled cheese and they came out perfect ! this would be great for singles college students and anyone who likes great things in small packages	13

0	the no name comedians at the beginning were funny bea arthur killed and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how african americans used to dig her backside but do n't any longer was funny courtney love 's antics were amusing but grew tiresome the rest of the roast was horrible telling tommy lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult and after it 's repeated ad nauseum it 's not funny either has andy dick ever been funny \? kimmel \? corolla \? sarah silverman \? spade post farley \? no it 's as if comedy central corralled the most unfunny comedians of the past 10 years and the bonus features are horrible the interviewer was annoying even the guests seemed annoyed with her was gilbert gottfried not available \? that guy is funny	13

1	i 'll admit that being able to go around as a stormtrooper and kill everything in sight is fun wicked fun this game delivers if you want to have a good time playing a fps involving star wars the major drawback to the game is the targetting it 's like using a sniper rifle in halo 1 but the reticle is the size the one for the assault rifle you can turn on the auto aim option to help with accuracy but then the reticle tends to follow an enemy on screen and it 's more difficult to shoot over an ally 's shoulder another drawback is that you ca n't jump fall and shoot at the same time like in other fpss plus fighters are hard to learn how to use as are other vehicles you can still do fine as a footsoldier but it would be nice if the vehicles were a little easier to use	13
0	easy setup but who cares when the end result is a very slow video sort of reminded me of jim carey in the movie the mask when he whips his head from side to side and you see the blur that's what you see with this webcam ! do n't waste your money i'm sending it back tomorrow !	13

0	if i could give it a zero or negative rating i would when vibe was introduced it was a relevant interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative r b and hip hop artists the mag featured all kinds of artists not just who 's hot right now it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world lately i 've noticed that it 's nothing more than a fluffy version of the source i hate a lot of new rap music that 's out and did n't appreciate mags with rappers i dislike on the cover and is it me or does it seem like since mimi took over all of the female r b singers' covers and stories are horrible \( we wo n't even discuss that disgusting brandy cover \) ! this magazine sucks now and the only time i check it out is while i'm in line at the grocery store yes the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking i 'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription	13
0	waste of money waste of time well known cast amateurish direction plotless politically correct to the point of being stupid the film 's incessant attempts at humor fail eric roberts' character laughs off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film he is self important godless and emotionally false it 's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts' passionate farewell kiss most authentic moment in the film lee grant 's reaction to her dying son being carried off very difficult to watch through in one sitting because it 's so repetitive and vapid you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments if you choose to waste your time with this film you 'll be sorry you did	13

0	i read the other reviews and was greatly excited to order this entree i have bought 2 3 varieties of tasty bite from my local trader joes most are decently healthy and all are easy and fast to make peas and paneer as an entree is bland and without any heat spice i am a native indian so i can handle relatively spicy food however this entree does not merit even a 2 chili rating \( out of four \) as for food quality i would suggest microwaving the rice and entree separately otherwise the majority of the sauce seeps into the rice giving it a very unpleasant appearance if you boil the pouches \( an alternate option \) you may have even more success however most of us buy these because of the ease of preparation so boiling is n't a convenient option the rice tastes and looks as it should finally i do recommend tasty bite entr e jaipur vegetables i am on box nine of twelve and still not tired this entree is much spicier closer to a 3 25 chili rating \( out of four \) i also favor this entree because it does n't have the throw away plastic container in each box moreover you get 12 boxes for a better price than the 6 boxes for the peas and paneer i look forward to trying the other tasty bites though i will likely sample the flavors at trader joe 's before ordering another 6 or 12 box set no more tasty bite purchases from the gold box unless i have already tried that particular flavor lesson learned	13

1	note the amazon description does not include dimensions on the package it recommends that you measure first it fits smokers that are 30 \( 76cm \) across \( perhaps including handles not sure \) and are 36 \( 91cm \) vertically it 's a bit big for my standard sized smoker \( about 20 across \) so it is unflattering to its graceful curves but good enough to be useful it is cheaply made but looks like it will be suitable i will update my report if it falls apart in use \( like another reviewer said \) it is quite possible that a garbage bag would be enough to protect your grill the main advantage here is that it fits a bit better and has elastic to close the bottom a bit it probably looks a bit better if you care	13

1	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
1	i usually do not endorse a product as a must have due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community however this item is the only exception to my rule i got this speed loaded to compliment my mp5 with a 100 round drum and anyone with carpel tunnel syndrome can testify to it 's a real pain to load that much one at a time to satisfy this problem enter the speed loader pretty simple design and execution open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly that easy easily loads a 30 round magazine in less than three seconds it 's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks which it should n't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover sounds ridiculous but i 've seen it done by the air force guys i play with but let 's face it if you only have so many magazines drums you 're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you i strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch i carry mine in my bdu pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although i try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort i strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it 's made of plastic not metal lastly a warning do n't go too overboard with the primer sometimes if you 're not watching it you 'll overload the magazine drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you 've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up unless you 're at a friends house let them clean it up	13

1	i rented this \( sigh \) several years ago liked it or julia roberts enough to buy it but did n't open the new copy until the other day and watched it today i regretted buying a new copy after all remembering it only as a few heartwarming \( i did n't want my heart warmed \) months in the lives of just plain folks in ct \( incidentally the 3 girls are not sisters just 2 of them \) i made fun of it my friend made fun of it i watched a few minutes then turned it off then watched some more finally got up to about 40 minutes and decided to finish it it has charm it is a soap opera but i thought it was well acted and well done it had humor happiness sadness embarrassment \( like the barrels of fish in the rich kid 's car \) love it had so much plot that it practically had none at all and i liked it but now 15 minutes later i'm beginning all over again to wonder why i bought it i could have done without hearing sinatra singing in the background toward the end of the flick that man was a nauseous menace and could barely sing at all no range no depth somehow he could carry a tune but that 's about the size of it speaking of size the size of his ego \( which i assume is why he did n't deign to sing the tunes the way the songwriters wrote them or the lyrics \) would have made a mushroom cloud ! i recommend this movie if you like this kind of thing for it 's kind i thought it was perfectly done i just like them a smidge more sophisticated the vulgarity and blasphemies were delicious	13
1	the station agent is a touching yet off the beaten path kind of flick that i found simply endearing to watch fin \( peter dinklage \) has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in new jersey having a passion for trains he embraces this as his home however he only wishes to be left alone and finds that 's not as easy to do as he would have thought first he discovers joe \( bobby cannavale \) who has set up a food truck outside his home joe is a conversationalist desperate to talk to anyone and everyone next fin meets olivia \( patricia clarkson \) who almost runs him off the road twice these three appear to have nothing in common and despite all odds they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see all three actors gave amazing performances dinklage as always commands every scene he is in i 've missed seeing him since the bastards at cbs quashed threshold so it was nice to see something with him in it again cannavale amused me with his character joe who really needed to get a life the idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least and clarkson radiated as olivia a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her what i liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through fin 's eyes there were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average plus there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier did n't even see that he was standing there so she did n't ring him up until he could get her attention it just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically all in all excellent film	13
0	the doll is a great gift for little girls who love dolls my 6 year old loved the doll i do not like the way allysens hair sheds when you comb it when allysen asked when is your birthday \? my daughter had to keep repeating herself when allysen asked what is your name the same thing happened so my daughter got stuck with happy new year as her birthday and sweetie as her name when you ask allysen to read her book she asked for a smoothie she is also very loud my daughter slept with allysen and carried her around everywhere she went when allysens batteries died she went back in the box	13

0	as curious as i was about this movie it had me dazed the 'good shepherd' always struck me symbol for christianity shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten what 's good about that \? fortunately sheep do n't have the intelligence to be paranoid with bourne identity movies under his belt matt damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies is this one a killer or dead on arrival \? with a budget of 85m we 've got oscar winning actors writers cinematographers and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see pet project of actor turning director robert de niro the good shepherd tells a story of the cia from its early days weighing in at just under three hours the scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around once that 's miss you wo n't get it this is a shame because it 's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically shot this movie is told from damon 's point of view its scope is epic and covering the years from 1939 before the cia was even a speck in president truman 's eye to 1961 and the bay of pigs we see the founding years the london blitz post war reconstruction in berlin and increasingly intricate machinations as the cold war gathers pace angelina jolie does n't feature in much of the movie but when she does she' get into character very well it 's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable robert de niro \( got to love him \) in the director 's chair is sadly the weakest link although he handles it professionally almost magisterially he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum convey gradual moral decay or make this the godfather standard bearer of cia films he 's done a fine job just bitten off a bit more than he can chew what he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world 's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to given that his mentors are people like francis ford coppola \( who is the executive producer \) with sufficient dedication it is easy to imagine de niro pulling off an oscar for direction in a future film his grasp is very broad and all it needs is a little tweaking	13
1	of course no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that dizzy could his trumpet can only be described as hot and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air this man 's music has life in it unfortunately the real energy to dizzy is in his latin jazz work and a more complete compilation of that style would be the compact jazz series ken burns' collection here is more versatile but just not as lively as dizzy 's music can be proceed with caution	13

0	i purchased this movie without reading the reviews based only on my fondness for older movies and the other movies i 've seen the two main stars in this movie was awful and the sad part is there were sooooo many opportunities to save the movie all throughout the acting was obviously overdone on purpose i just wish i knew why it did n't come off as funny or as a satire if that was the intent in the end i threw out the dvd so as not to accidently subject someone else to it	13
1	quite simply it 's great though a bit on the challenging side gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title and one that despite it 's 'rated 'e' for everyone' approach will appeal to adults as well as kids it 's not without some light frustration but the good far outweighs the bad ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up replay value is in the four different cases as well as some unlockable minigames and a 'touch' list if you like adventure titles like phoenix wright and trace memory \( or maniac mansion for that matter \) then you 'll really dig this game a good solid four stars	13
1	i work out at home using dumbells and a number of bodyweight exercises my dumbbell collection had grown cumbersome and messy so i looked around for a way to organize these dumbells in my room and this rack was perfect i did look at a number of racks both online and in rl but the majority were way over my budget had crippling shipping charges or were too limited in terms of their capacity to space ratio i was just about ready to fabricate my own when i found this on amazon after reading the reviews and crunching the numbers i decided to give this a shot i'm happy to report this has completely solved my dumbbell storage problems this rack arrived a couple of days before anticipated with the use of a single crescent wrench i put it together without assistance in the space of an hour or so well within 2 hours of opening the box it was in place and holding weights it is solidly made of heavy gauge steel and quality welds covered in a tough tactile coating material the construction method is of simple carriage bolt and nylon insert locknut assembly it ships with rubber coverings for the feet and all orifices the actual dimensions of this rack are 36 75 x 24 x 32 \( w x d x h \) add at least a foot to the height for the minimum workable usage space \( for lifting the weights in and out \) i have filled it 's available space with sets of 10 50 dumbbells in 5 increments for the past month it has held 540 and remained absolutely rock solid from the feel of the thing it could hold easily twice this weight without issue highly recommended for personal use or even tight boutique space	13
1	i bought this stroller to replace my combi ithru but found that i needed to keep it although this schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back the recline position is a bit to far back for mall strolling making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby aside from that the schwinn handles tough terrain like a mercedes benz or cadillac its great ! baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller it has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements it steers like a dream ! grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime no extra effort needed the big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby my daughter is 13 months old 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into the stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable the only thing i do n't really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby the reason why i kept my combi i thru aside from that i recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain ! this one can handle it all happy strolling	13

0	i got this magazine for a year and a half before i had to quit my subscription recently i liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style and that is why i subscribed to begin with but i was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me \( not to mention an overload of advertising which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway so that 's not a complaint \) sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased \( telling the facts of stds and such \) but 90 of the articles on sex were opinion and not fact girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like seventeen who say that sex is good if you 're ready \( what 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an std or a baby \? \? please \) and that condoms are 100 effective they are not but that 's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this they need to take advice from their parents and doctors not magazine articles i was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences	13
1	5 stars to the film itself ! here 's a painful study of a woman 's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of industrial waste the character study is not unlike claustrophobic polanski 's repulsion but dwells on vitti 's being consumed by her external surroundings as opposed to deneuve 's intensive plunge to schizophrenia the pace and landscape is virtual antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who are not familiar with the director 's works one of his greatest works \( l'avventura remains his best to me \) the only problem is the dvd transfer i 've seen the vhs and it has a consistent hue of orange the dvd although sharper and clearer fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds and oranges in long shots for a film that essentially deals with color \( it was antonioni 's first color feature \) the transfer was rather clumsy and careless the sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement why did n't criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film	13

1	this book appears on most of the 'best of' science fiction lists that various pundits and critics have put out even though it is not a very commonly known work does it deserve such a placing \? i think the answer to that depends upon what your viewpoint is about what science fiction as a form of literature is supposed to accomplish the idea is simple enough a new drug developed from the bacteria that causes syphilis is found to have the property of greatly increasing a person 's intelligence but with major side effect it kills the user in about nine months the story follows one louis sacchetti a conscientious objector to a seemingly interminable war and who would already be considered to be a genius by most standards as he is transferred from a standard prison to a facility specially constructed to see what will happen to its inmates when given this drug the story is told through the means of a journal that louis is encouraged almost forced to keep as this idea is extremely similar to that of daniel keyes' flowers for algernon \( which was later made into the movie charly \) comparison is invited flowers emphasizes the tragedy of the hero a man who struggles to find those bits of knowledge that will help not just himself but all mankind up against an unbeatable problem that of his own retreat to sub normal intelligence again camp concentration follows a completely different path that of the essential selfishness of the individual of nihilism of the despair of ever being able to change humanity in any meaningful way the inmates that louis initially documents are apparently using their greatly enhanced intelligence to investigate alchemy as a means of providing immortality not for humanity in general but for themselves and the 'warden' of this prison humphrey haast louis meanwhile seems caught up in crafting new poems and a play entitled 'auswitch a comedy' the title is indicative of something disch does throughout this book playing with names and titles to produce another layer of meaning behind the straightforward words and is fairly effective in doing so the tone is the primary thing here a very dark brooding atmosphere enlivened by a very wide ranging vocabulary and many references both buried and open to other works of literature \( most especially dante \) and scientific and psychological theories readers who are not familiar with these references may feel a little lost at places in this book at least i did as my breadth of knowledge in these areas is clearly more limited than disch 's but from this tone disch develops his themes of the corruption of man of his baser desires the absolute horrors of what man is capable of and where such capacity leads as such this book is almost the complete antithesis of flowers for algernon that is until the ending of this book the ending of this book i felt rather drastically detracted from its overall message as it does n't seem to fit with the rest and has a little of a deus ex machina feel to it given the many layered discourse that disch presented in the rest of the book which while sometimes difficult to follow was certainly excellent writing this ending was a disappointment while this is certainly a major entry into the dystopian side of science fiction literature whether it truly qualifies as a 'classic' will be i'm afraid very much a matter of opinion for a long time to come but it is certainly worth reading if for nothing else than to see the darker side of genius competently presented reviewed by patrick shepherd \( hyperpat	14
0	this was given to us about last christmas to replace our old one not worth it a couple months into our ownership of this item it stopped working properly the right burner remains on at all times we have to actually unplug it when not in use because even though the dial is turned all the way down it is very very hot when it is plugged in and turned off so the right burner remains on hi all the time and the left burner is either lo or hi there is no concept of temperature control with this device if the knob is a centimeter below medium on the left burner then the heat will be very low too low to cook most things if it 's a centimeter above medium it 's hot if you want medium heat to work good luck it worked ok until it broke however it was never especially powerful i ca n't even tolerate trying to cook with it anymore i just go to the apartment downstairs and cook on my boyfriend 's mom 's gas stove for nice even heating but a ministove that they are dubbing 'professional' should not be breaking after like three months	14

1	my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors i like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen ! it has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile it was a little difficult at first for my son to handle since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast the colors are pretty cool the faster it spins the more colors come out \( primary yellow orange colors \) i like that it holds his interest a could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow !	14

0	i am a time person of the year 2003 \( shared title actively deployed u s servicemembers \) i must say that reading time magazine is like reading the platform for the democratic party actually it is even worse than that it is like reading john dean 's diary filled more with fantasy and personal wishes than actual reality one of the latest from the online edition is that realists have taken over washington give me a break a new set of hogs have come in to take over at the troff and that is it anyone who believes nancy pelosi and her gang of political hacks is going to help america is a fool best thing we can hope for is that they create so much gridlock that no one can spend any money in washington maybe then they will see that america improves on its own and politicians on both side make things awful the sad thing is that people that read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something about the world this publication is so biased that it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try to repeat what they have learned if you want a truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe to the economist it probably will not change your political affiliations but it will at least make you sound competent when you debate others the economist is quite simply the best weekly news magazine in existence the articles are well written by people that know what they are talking about leaders from around the world read and contribute to the economist this is something that time newsweek and the rest of their ilk cannot claim i am not affiliated with any political parties and do not consider myself political i look at things from an economic perspective and vote accordingly	14

0	there 's always the argument that if bach had had a modern piano he would have composed for it let 's consider another possibility if some style insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to bach 's doorstep he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the high baroque composers for listeners who understand what bach meant by equal temperament it 's worth noting that the standard temperament of the modern piano bears no close connection to what bach was trying to demonstrate in these pedagogical compositions in other words the point is lost	14

1	the afro eurasian eclipse is a groundbreaking suite full of intriguing new sounds and grooves ellington did n't fade into predictability and mundanity in his last years instead his compositions became more and more original and exciting this suite has rocking swinging waltzing grooves that though seemingly disparate work together and illustrate the theme stated in the duke 's spoken introduction to the suite to show that the whole world is going oriental and that no one will be able to retain his or her identity not even the orientals duke does n't leave his standbys behind though the phenomenal playing of ashby carney jones and the rest of the orchestra keeps the afro eurasian eclipse firmly rooted in virtuosity even when playing to new grooves melded with african asian and australian rhythm and sound on a personal note this is one of my favorite cds aside from the remarkable music it gets bonus points for the spoken introduction at the beginning of the chinoiserie track audio notes give the listener a greater understanding of the cd especially one with a single focus like this one	14

0	i was so excited to get this ! the terrain on our lot has quite a slant to it because we 're on a hill my husband and i thought this would easily help us create a materials list for our retaining walls that we wanted to put out front long story short i spent hours \( at least 40 \) getting the dimensions of our house correct and trying to get the yard right we even rented a surveying instrument to determine the slope of our yard to input elevation points many hours wasted the software does not let you set the height of the retaining walls and it inputs random walls and pieces of wall in the 3 d view that you ca n't get rid of the flowers are hard to place they do n't end up where you want them besides the plant chooser does n't have hardly any perrenial plants to choose from bottom line i spent 50 in software costs and 50 for a surveying instrument and ended up having to calculate the wall length and height manually if you have a flat lot this might work well for you for anyone that has hills or slopes to their yard good luck !	14

1	i have tried to lose weight for a long l o n g time also for a long l o n g time i have seen newpaper advertizements for this tea it seemed ridiculous to me at first i mean lose weight by drinking tea \? this idea had just about as much credibility to me as some of those sauna belts \( which can help you lose weight for a full 24 hours after which time it comes back again ! \) well last year i was getting pretty desperate i had somehow managed to lose 40 pounds by drinking only regular tea instant coffee and home made lemonade and eating only bird 's eye vegetables and turkey \( in fact i have invented the turkey diet ! it 's very simple eat turkey fall asleep \( from the tryptophan ! \) and if you fall asleep you ca n't eat you see a variation i guess on the hollywood diet which can be used only on weekends because most people need to stay awake during the week to go to work ! \) anyway this diet worked for me but it was pretty boring took most of my free time away and turkey is expernsive ! i gradually stopped this diet and gradually got back 20 of those 40 pounds i looked desperately for another way to lose weight but drinking tea to do it just did n't logical however no other method presented itself that was as inexpensive as drinking tea and after all that expensive \( but delicious ! \) turkey it seemd a good way to go now this particular tea itself is quite expensive 43 for 4 ounces \( on sale ouch ! \) but the 4 ounces of lose tea would make at least 60 6 ounce cups \( 360 ounces and i 'd of course be adding my own water and sweetener \) so i figured why not \? \( well because of the possible bad taste that 's why not i 've tried herbal teas in the past and with the delicious exception of jasmine tea thoroughly disliked each one \) but even so i decided to risk it i 've tasted far worse things than herbal tea after all so about a year ago i sent away for it when the wu long tea arrived \( in a lovely little transparent green plastic bag lined with aluminum foil giving the impression of a crushed green diamond \) i made it and drank it hmmm \( or rather mmmm ! \) not bad tasting at all ! it tasted like the best black tea the kind \( other than jasmine \) that i like the best but as the tea was so expensive i decided not to drink it too often as the owner of a healthy refrigerator \( one loaded with vitamins which i take only in emergencies because i ca n't afford to keep buying them \) i now had this healthy tea which i put in the refrigerator to keep it fresh \) to sort of keep the vitamins company ! i did throughly read the literature that came with the tea however and noticed that many people had praised the medicinal qualities of this tea along with it 's weight loss abilities hmmm i decided that i had happily gotten more than i bargained for a weight loss tea and one which helpoed with other health problems nice to get such a bargain but at 43 for 4 ounces of lose tea it was still quite expensive and so after that first cup i restrained myself from drinking it for quite some time actually i did n't drink another cup until about two weeks ago ! i was beginning to feel as if the minor cut i had gotten the week before had somehow let an infection in \( though the cut itself did n't look infected \) anyway i was beginning to feel very very very w e a k two years ago in fact i was hospitalized with an infection the very same infection that killed my mother the month before ! my mother in the hospital had said that she felt like a vegetable and having gotten the same infection i knew how accurate that description really was i was so weak then in fact i had had trouble raising my arms above my head ! and now i felt it was starting to happen again ! my first thought was to call 911 but my second thought was strangely concentrated on those glowing testimonials i had read from other customers who had used wu long tea i figured i 'd try to make myself a cup if the tea did n't work i could always call 911 after all though i felt very weak i did n't feel totally paralzyed yet anyway but i knew i had to make and drink that tea fast before total weakness engulfed me did i feel up to doing so \? yes i f took my time i f i was very careful and i f i stayed very near the telephone as i made the tea just in case i managed to make myself the cup of tea to wait for it to cool down a bit and to drink it within an hour the feeling of weakness had left me ! and as of this writing taking place a full two weeks later the weakness \( and presumably the infection \) have not come back ! \( oh if only i had had the courage to buy this tea t w o years ago and give it to my wonderful mother ! ! ! ! ! ! \) now i'm not saying this tea will work miracles for everyone and in every circumstance the tea did not transform my looks to those of princess grace \( whom i consider the most beautiful woman of all time \) and have not cured me of a very slight case of myasthenia gravis a neuro muscular ailment which i have had since the age of four i doubt very much that it has made me immortal and i know for a fact that it has not granted me super powers or the ability to fly or to transcend time \( no one has ever accused me of not having a good imagination ! \) however upon drinking that tea my feelings of infection \( a feeling of weakness quite different from that of myasthenia gravis \) did go away ! i do n't remember what the other testimonals for this tea were but i'm sure now that at least 98 of them are true ! perhaps there is no real fountain of youth but this tea which seems to cure many ailments and most probably helps one lose weight as well if taken often enough seems a very close second ponce de leon would have been happy with it i'm sure i do n't know if it will help everyone but i do know it helped me \( and probably the other people who gave testimonials too \) and that second cup of tea even the whole 4 ounces of lose tea are certainly less expensive than going to the hospital ! for those on a budget like me wu long tea is it seems destined to be used as a luxury and or in an emergency but i really feel it belongs in every home just like aspirin does and for emergency use please take the same precautions i did 1 \) be sure you do have the energy to actually make and drink the tea and 2 \) be near a telephone so you can call 911 in case the tea does n't work for you the tea did work for me in the above circumstance anyway an elixir of life \? perhaps and perhaps not depending on the person and the circumstances all i know is that for me and under the circumstances described above it certainly seems to have saved mine !	14

0	much worse than previous mcafee editions i dropped norton on some older desktops due to its lack of support for w2000 i then went to the free edition of avg anti virus which was ok but slowed things down thinking you get what you pay for i sprung for mcafee which has been ok in the past the edition i purchased has 3 licenses i installed one of these on my wife 's xp laptop as well as one of my desktops \( luckily she 's still talking to me \) the 2007 mcafee suite makes avg look like a free ferrari absolutely terrible performance coupled with a mediocre interface perhaps the only poorer performing way to assure you 'll never get a virus spam etc would be to hit your motherboard with a hammer this will slow down your computer \( even worse unpredictably \) if you have lots of email in outlook or outlook express expect to open your mail box then have a long break before you can do a thing \( as it rechecks everything for spam \) there 's a partial workaround for this but users should n't have to search for workarounds every web action now has noticeable latency as well as slower applications when mcafee is grinding away in the background if you liked your current anti spam kiss it goodbye mcafee may not let you keep it mcafee \( like norton \) is also difficult to remove from your system what prompted this review \? today it appears the update process rebooted my computer without requiring a yes from me as for alternatives i was n't able to get kaspersky anti virus to run on an older machine somewhare a remnant of norton persisted \( possibly a document tagged symantec etc left over from a day of working with them ages ago \) however i did get it running on a laptop and its better than norton mcafee and even avg in my opinion so consider kaspersky or another vendor if that does n't work try avg it will be interesting to see how mcafee responds they 've really shot themselves in the foot with this release	14
0	i was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by christiane northrup in this jumble of a book at a time when i needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body i turned to christian northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause a wonderful combination if northrup had chosen to focus on menopause instead she is all over the map taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life if i wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers husbands and daughters i could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life instead i sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life if you are a middle aged woman who has stuffed your feelings all your life and need help speaking up for your youself this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice but if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured this book will shock you with its pettiness i am quite new age and believe in all the woo woo stuff mentioned in this book but when i turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue that 's what i expect i can only hope that northrup will re read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication i was embarrassed for her and returned it i just do n't buy it in more ways then one	14

1	these 2 games are probably \( in my opinion anyway \) the best ones in the series i will review each game seperatly then make my comments on the collection itself ff5 one of the previously unreleased ff games \( at the time anyway \) is now in america i really like choosing classes because it does to raise the replay value through the roof i literally trained my characters \( this is during the between the beginning and the middle of the game \) to get to level 30 or 40 \( ca n't remember exactly \) just to get my jobs mastered the storyline is good as well because unlike some of the other ff games this one sticks with the one you need to get rid of \( x death \) rather than fighting the final battle against someone that you have no clue on what makes that character so evil and why your fighting him her instead of the one who is destroying the world the bad thing about this game is the lack of characters \( there 's only 5 in the entire game you stick with 4 one of them dies and is replaced with his granddaughter \) so be prepared to look at the same 4 characters on the screen and also not having a menu to change characters ff6 i think this is the best one in the series there is absolutly no real main character in this game for those who are confused what i mean is that well for example ff7 you have about 9 characters but the leader character is cloud \( the one you see and control in the fields in the majority of the game \) well in this game you can have 4 different characters in your party and you have the ability to put in any character as the leader the characters are excellent in this game i pretty much like all of them \( gau is funny but he does n't have the best abilities and one of the secret characters you ca n't even control them at all during battle \) sabin having the blitz ability for those of you who have been playing fighting games for years will have a pretty good understanding of this but sadly when you make a move no matter which direction your facing you still hae to put in that same command in the same direction for instance one of the moves is rlr \( i am talking about right left right on the control pad \) and if your character is facing to the right then you have to insert that command but if you are facing the opposite direction it is still the same command \( not the opposite combination \) when i first beat the game before beating it i got all of the characters to level 99 this game also has some of the best music for a ff game \( at the time anyway \) the collection itself you get a music cd the random battle screen is like ff7 and 8 's random battle loading screen ff6 has a bonus menu for looking at stats on enemies has cgi cinemas ff5 is pretty much like the super nes \( or should i say super famicom \) version with just the exception of random battle loading screens and psone style opening cinema and no extra bonuses because the game was never released in the usa and square probably wanted people to experience it without a huge bunch of bonus features overall if you like the snes ff games this is the right collection for you \( along with chronicles which includes ff4 \( ff2 in the usa for the snes \) and chrono trigger	14
1	i agree with nearly everyone 's reviews so i wont go over it again but the physics of the game is incredible ! i shot an ogre on top of a hill and the dead body rolled all the way to the bottom of the hill ! some advice pay attention to your compass and journal and you 'll never get lost completing quests finding a particular town finding a particular person etc one spoiler immediately starting the game go through the first few steps of the main quest you will be sent to a monastary that will supply your low level character with free equipment and a free horse ! also the official website has downloadable mods for sale for 0 99 1 99 etc per mod buy those ! it is as close to a perfect game as you can get \( and only one patch has come out so far !	14
1	fifteen years ago i purchased this book for the first time today i am buying it as a gift for my son i feel i am giving him the gift of life all over again even though i raised all my children with vitamin c added to their diets he seems to have fallen off the quot juice quot wagon ! linus pauling was not only brilliant but clear and concise i only wish i had known he published a book on quantum mechanics a long time ago i shall purchase that too at last and maybe i shall have an inkling of what it is all about	14

0	i bought this product and the accuracy depends on having good test strips i simultaneously had bloodwork at the doctor 's office when i did the test except for the total cholesterol all the other tests were off the manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done except for total cholestrol the other test strips did not have a blue color the test strips which are expensive were bad i am planning on returning this produc	14

1	there are plenty of anti bush films and books around if you only shall see or read one this must be the best pick i like michael moore very much but he is not really a political heavyweighter and i do n't think fahrenheit 9 11 is his best work it does not mix humour and political insight as well as the book stupid white men for instance it is more like two or three movies in one william karel is a political heavyweighter and he does not try to make anything more than a documentary but what a documentary it has turned out to be very disturbing insights from informed sources among them former cia agents it is not usual to hear such plain speaking from people in high places just a few years after the events this film is perhaps not as entertaining as fahrenheit 9 11 but far more informative	14
1	the quality and workmanship is top notch ! the price is high for a razor but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the gillette fusion at 4 a pop ! and it will last you a lifetime replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer ! i was only getting 4 5 shaves from a fusion blade but i can shave my face and head for at least 2 3 weeks on a single safey razor blade \) even if i changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion it takes some getting used to i got a few minor nicks when i first started using it but now i never get any i even shave my head with it \) i 've had mine for about 6 months and love it i suggest starting out on the 1 setting and work your way up for me right between 1 and 2 is best any higher and the shave is too close	14
1	i am very happy with the trainer most impressively it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer i can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family i ride about 30 minutes a day on it it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program	14
0	i bought this table set for my son because it was inexpensive and i did not want to spend a lot of money for something that was sure to get paint and glue all over it from day one it was a big dissapointment the chairs are very easily tipped over he can not even sit on the chair if i am not holding it or the chair would fall over the tabe is not made well as it is easy for things to slide off the surface it seems to be slightly raised in the middle i am now online shopping for a new one so instead of paying 100 dollars the first time around i am now spending the 30 dollars already spend and an additional 100 for the new tabl	14
1	i dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and wo n't close after some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place i finally was able to close the lens besides that it is an awesome camera i am able to pick out a color \( ex red \) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white no photoshop needed	14
1	eeks mice are great ! most catnip mice lose their flavor smell attraction for my cats pretty quickly but my cats still play with an eeks i 've had for over a year the one drawback is that they do n't look too good after being played with \( teeth marks drool stains ripped off tails etc \) but cats do n't care about that	14

0	however after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from amazon it is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay so if you have had good luck with one so far be glad because i paid for the 2 day shipping could n't wait and have great disappointment because now i have to return it !	14
1	we all love this toy what i like about it is that it 's easy to use even for my almost three yr old it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious it 's sturdy \( will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard \) it looks good not cheap and it 's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes this has been the big hit this christmas even more so than tekno puppy	14
1	this mascara goes on beautifully and looks great but it 's messy it 's more liquid than most mascaras and when i travel with it the tube leaks ! it also tends to smear when i first put it on but after it dries it 's good for the day if you carry mascara with you or travel often look for another brand	14
0	i realize the price being so low that i would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine i did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike it does not since it does not fit over both tires the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit i have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable my tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike very misleading ! very disappointed	14
1	my 24 month old son loves this bike it was fairly easy to put together and works well thanks	14

1	now i know what you 're thinking why are there two releases of xx \? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re released the album xx but they also re recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals \( big mistake ! \) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001 if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !	14
1	i own this seat for my son who is age 6 it is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age 8 the seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable the headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck the price is decent too the only issue i have with this seat is the cupholders if you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car the cupholders are n't very usable additionally the cupholders do n't slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat personally i leave the cupholders pushed in i have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my 10 year old in the back seat i wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such furthermore with booster seats in general i think they are very impractical for families who need to fit 3 kids across the backseat my son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium i would love a forward facing booster seat with a 5 point harness that would lock into the latch loops for the older child not only is a 5 point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side as far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt this is a nice option	14
1	i hate long socks and smelly shoes so i 've become a big fan of shoe liners i recently ordered a set of these and am very happy with them they are each individually priced at 5 99 so for 6 pairs you 'd pay 36 retail so this is a good deal at 4 pair more importantly they are heavy weight cotton with no underside seam they have elastic all around the opening and actually stay on your feet they are cut generously my feet are about size 8 and they are a little big but manageable if you have smaller feet i 'd try to get a different size than m l they do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others they are fine with loafers but a lower cut shoe could be problematic i 've tried a lot of these socks calvin klein ralph lauren donna karan peds leggs et al these are by far the best	14

0	if i could give it a zero or negative rating i would when vibe was introduced it was a relevant interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative r b and hip hop artists the mag featured all kinds of artists not just who 's hot right now it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world lately i 've noticed that it 's nothing more than a fluffy version of the source i hate a lot of new rap music that 's out and did n't appreciate mags with rappers i dislike on the cover and is it me or does it seem like since mimi took over all of the female r b singers' covers and stories are horrible \( we wo n't even discuss that disgusting brandy cover \) ! this magazine sucks now and the only time i check it out is while i'm in line at the grocery store yes the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking i 'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription	14
1	this nursery care kit is great ! before buying another care kit consider the following points with the time and frustration you will save you 'll be glad you did the first week home from the hospital i used the nasal aspirator countless times it is very gentle but very effective the digital thermometer is quick and easy to use so much better than the glass and mercury kind the medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby the nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby 's finger anyone that has ever cut their baby 's finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that ! the items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store great to keep in your diaper bag for when you 're on the go	14
1	i read the pig man by paul zindel for a summer vacation assignment in all i do not enjoy reading books but i was surprised by the humor in this book when i was reading it i would have to stop reading and i would start laughing it would take a while to calm myself down it first started with john and lorraine then a lot of strange things started to happen to them the old man that they where trying to prank call was actually going to give them money when they meet him it all changed they where worried because they lied to him and did not know what to do they told him the truth and became good friends with the pig man they called him the pig man because his name was mr pignati and he collected hundreds of little pig statues john and lorraine learned a lot about the importance of life as they grew to love the pig man this sad story has to taught them how to move on after a loved one has died	14
0	this blender died after 4 months of light use i never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous i only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half frozen berries after two months the motor started to have that burned smell when i used it after three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack at four months the motor started making funny noises it smelled terrible and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use all in all this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash i will never buy a hamilton beach product again	14

1	this umbrella 's quality belies its bargain price it assembled easily and opens closes smoothly the construction seems sturdy and the fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out of the shipping crate my only complaint and it 's almost trivial is the resin finial faded rather quickly in the sunlight i'm overall quite pleased with the product and i'm looking for places in my yard to utilize more of these	14

0	first of all i only gave this one star because the rating does n't let you go any lower i only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it leaving me to pick it up i proceeded to suffer through it so i could give you fair warning if you buy this consider yourself warned	14
1	this was a subject of much conversation when i was deployed to saudi arabia and it 's still a favorite with most military and civilians in iraq ground hog day is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same until finally the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it 's the day you leave the movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique bill murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well it 's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here	14

0	i have seen this product \( and others similar to it \) as an rn we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the cuteness of items that are geared only to be sold not to be useful although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful and some essential it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately in this way you can check for quality and longevity put together your own kit	14
0	be forwarned that this is more for isolated toning legs arms shoulders hips rather than pilates workout does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them the trainer on the dvd has flabby abs and thick torso rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer it is not up to the caliber of what i have come to expect from pilates also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment as equipment kept slipping down or up need to go back to the drawing board on this one there are better less expensive better made options out there with better training keep on looking	14

0	not a great one here entertaining for all the wrong reasons mainly because the film is so bad so often it is nice to see christina ricci in a movie again as she 's usually good even in a bad movie and does n't do too bad here wes craven directs this one and i could tell right away it must have been do to a contract obligation \( much like edward norton in the italian job \) i could tell this because very little effort seemed to be put into the script both the story and lines of dialogue were very predictable and dumb also very little effort seemed to be put into the effects as they were very lousy at times especially when they finally showed the werewolf as i said before quite predictable the story was both ricci and her brother get bitten by a werewolf after they try to save a girl who got into a car wreck then both try to figure out what 's wrong with them though the brother is much more active about it than ricci it 's also quite obvious who the main werewolf was the film tries a bit of a swerve but it does n't really work besides ricci the cast includes shannon elizabeth \( american pie 1 2 \) portia de rossi \( arrested development \) joshua jackson \( pacey on dawson 's creek \) scott baio \( do n't ask me why \) among others all do pretty poor jobs besides ricci that is the rest do n't really seem to care not that i blame them that is there is some humor throughout the film but a lot of the film will get unintentional laughs from those who watch it the only reason to watch this is to make fun of it as the effort is not really there by mostly anybody on the cast or crew	14
1	i'm excited to find these for sale on amazon and at a very reasonable price ! i just tried them for the first time a few days ago and was wishing there was a nearby store that carried them everyone i 've given them to has liked them even those who are not normally healthy eaters these crisps are reminiscent of puffy corn snacks \( like cheetos \) but with a different light flavor the calorie content is similar to other chip type snacks \( 150 per serving \) but these have the nutrition benefits of peas protein \( 5g per serving \) calcium \( 6 dv per serving \) and iron \( 4 dv per serving \) i have n't tried the ceasar flavor yet but intend to do so in the near future	14
0	i'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official nfl football from a previous year and i wanted to get another one for backup i know 'the duke' is supposed to be the official nfl ball from this year but there seems to be something wrong with the balls amazon is shipping the first ball i got from amazon was hard as a rock slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces i got a second one and the stitching was a bit better but it was still hard and slippery and when it was exposed to rain the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring i have no clue if that 's to be expected or not since it 's all leather but it seems odd in any case you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball so it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe i play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands \( which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls \) maybe the footballs just need to be broken in but i'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them which no one seems to want to do i 've tried to let some air out to make the things more user friendly but it does n't really help anyway i find it really hard to believe this is the ball the nfl played with this year something about them just seems cheaply made in any case i suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball	14
1	and they are working out great with our thomas layouts melissa doug products continue to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great educational value these are educational and your children will learn things like police station fire station hospital school town hall grocery store and post office there are several different shapes too including squares rectangles triangle and the various signs the buildings and most of the roof pieces only have the building design on one side the trees ambulance fire truck and mail truck are large and double sided the various street signs and passenger cars are a little small and as the box states ages 3 and up i would consider these smaller pieces a choking hazard the larger pieces are enjoyed by both my 1 yr old and my 3 yr old the rectangles are the largest piece in the set and measure 4 3 4 by 2 1 4 approx squares are roughly 2 1 4 x 2 1 4 these blocks are not as heavy as i expected but still nicely made and bright colorful additions to playsets like thomas brio train sets if your children do n't insist on the real thing this is a great way to save some money and still buy a quality product the only drawback is the wooden storage box does n't come with a sliding plexi cover like the melissa doug pizza set or beading set does that would be really nice for storage and secure those little pieces that we do n't use	14

0	the idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic you have a regular burner and a small grill at the same time the execution however leaves a lot to be desired fit and finish in this product are extremely poor out of the box paint was flaking and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit the igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part the grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when i received the unit reading other reviews i ca n't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number the bad kind and the good kind if so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety	14

1	over the years i have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and i never liked using any of them i recently bought a new set which i had to return due to the fact that i had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls they would immediately fall out of my hair scream ! i bought the remmington 1080n wax core roller set and i have finally found the easiest and quickest way to curl my hair the rollers surface when warm grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair the rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair once heated the rollers are relatively cool to the touch \( no more burned fingers \) but due to the wax core the rollers hold plenty of heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent long lasting results the set takes about 10 15 minutes to warm up i 've found the warm up time takes longer than the time i actually leave the curlers in my hair this is the best curler set i have ever used if i was to ask for one change it would be a quicker warm up time however just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation i'm hard to please so my recommendation says alot thanks remmington \( i still do n't like your other regular rollers ! ha \)	14
0	i have to say i am very disappointed with this camera i had really high hopes for this one i waited for the hd2 to come out and when i saw a lot of positive reviews i bought one i should have waited for sanyo to call this an hd camera does n't make sense the picture has more grain and noise then my old high 8 camera outdoors in bright light the camera is ok low light is horriblepros nice form factor love the look and feel and it 's so tiny it fits in your pocket very portable and something you can take anywhere secure digital cards are great can transfer and edit on the computer quickly still pictures are pretty good although still digital cameras are better hdmi output can plug directly into your hdtv \( although if you are used to watching things in hd you will be disappointed \) cons indoor and low light situations very grainy even with the high sensitivity button do n't attempt to take still shots while you are filming it works but when you watch the film you hear loud noises and the shot pauses for 2 or 3 seconds and then continues very cheesy you can hear the data being written to the secured digital card on the video which is annoying i thought sd was supposed to minimize noise watching the playback of movement with this makes me dizzy not even fast movement either image stabilization is not that great either compared to other cameras i have used audio sounds a bit tinnyin my opinion this camera is geared for portability and being able to capture moments quickly as this is something you can always carry with you if you are n't too concerned with quality picture it 's probably fine i really think sanyo has a great concept and one day this could be the end all be all device for now it should come with a warning of it 's limitations i am not saying it 's total garbage but if you have high hopes like i did you will be disappointed	14
1	very comfortable and durable i would wear these outside although not for a long walk but the sole is durable enough for walking to the mailbox or taking the dog for a brief jaunt i recommend these if you are looking for an inexpensive and durable slipper	14

0	i bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer i tried to install and half way through the set up after it had uninstalled my old programs i got a message to abort the abort left me with a damaged media program and thus far i have spent over 400 trying to re connect damaged files and programs my best advice is to wait until microsoft gets the kinks out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade	14
1	i bought this to use with family photos and threw together my first 5 page comic last night it was fairly easy to use but not perfect instructions are thin \( read 'mostly nonexistant' \) so it is best that you either have time on your hand or a lot of experience using complex photo software good simple once you get the hang of it plenty of fixed comic book panel formats to chose from and the drag and drop photo application makes life very easy as long as you are ok with the formats provided then putting family photos into a fun comic book format is incredibly easy i received rave reviews from my first 'comic' and the finished product was of exceptional quality the sofware has a nice assortment of boxes call outs and even some fun clip art this was a great buy for the price not as good the learning curve can be steep due to the quirky layout of controls i guess this is not too bad of an issue since there are few controls provided with the software the dude who wrote instructions was flippant at best \( really annoying if you want to find a basic answer \) and definitely not paid to produce a quality product downloading photos was tough until i found out the trick after that it is quite easy bad no photo editing software included simple things like rotating photos 90 degrees had to be done prior to loading into comic book creator the instructions and comic book wizard are close to useless did i mention the controls \? they are basic \( good and bad \) and poorly laid out \( bad \) there is no ability to truly customize panel layouts so this software will not help out if you want something really creative \( diagonals overlays and more \) all in all this was an excellent buy for a software package under 20 i created a great storyboard format of some fun memories bringing a great laugh \( and a few wows \) to my family grandparents and friends just be aware that there is a learning curve to get over before you hit the fun stuff if the software was more expensive then i would have given it 3 stars	14
1	one of the movies i like to watch over and over jessica tandy played a great character in this movie my order came real quick	14
1	i bought this because i did not want to mount my garmin 350 nuvi to the windshield this device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars i drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard i can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag mounting arm separately	14
1	this cd provides a fantastic overview of rypdal who has been recording for ecm for 30 years now the tracks range from pieces with an quot electric miles quot sound to an orchestrated track while very diverse the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique atmospheric tone and excellent compositions the infamous ecm sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering informative liner notes as well highly recommended	14

1	i honestly do n't know why everybody is so negative regarding this game i think it 's phenominal ! great missions great story and game play and the variety in the weapon customization feature makes for fun little side quests overall it 's a great addition to the ffvii universe and i definitely hope to see more games with these characters coming out soon ! even a remake of the original ffvii would be grand ! on the whole vincent valentine is one bad dude ! the bosses are interesting and cool and the links to the original game are awesome ! if you 're a fan buy this game if you 're not a fan and want to have an interesting gaming experience the please consider this title the timewarrior has spoken	14

1	phantom quest corp an action comedy film about the drunken karoake singing party girl ayaka and her friends taking on paranormal enemies from dracula to a possessed surgeon mummies and even magical monks this movie is a comedic romp through the world of supernatural events the only set backs on this flick can be that the theme songs can get a little annoying after hearing them too many times the series is too short although it was still good the video quality was also pretty nice and subtitles were understandable and on que the plot is sort of like scooby doo without the guys in masks but more action and laughs all in all this film is a great buy and worth the money spent a great addition to any anime collection	14
0	the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk	14
1	while not on the 'highest end' of tripod purchases this one is a must for anyone owning a hdr hc1 or other compatable camcorder operating the camera from the tripod \( rather than the touch screen \) provides steady footage for the amatuer videographer the unit assembles easily and has stable panning and rotation the only drawback is the soft storage bag which does n't provide adequate head protection	14
1	i bought the bean bag toss as a christmas gift for my 22 month old son he had played the bean bag toss the first time at the halloween carnival at the church it was all he wanted to play that night i wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day at just three pieces it is simple to put together and take apart although it says it is for 5 and older it would probably get old fast for a child that age	14
0	it is ludicrous to even mention the fact that the duprees have lasted so long and can still be seen in atlantic city considering the fact that there is not one original member of the duprees in the group that is seen in atlantic city this is a major problem with many groups purporting to be from the 50 's and 60 's the duprees appearing today is a perfect example of caveat emptor buyer beware for those readers who do n't read latin ! for those of us who were duprees fans this is a not to be missed cd of the original duprees with the incomparable sound of joey vann and harmony that is hard to match they did joni james proud in their remake of a number of her hits it is nostalgia personified hearing the original duprees	14

1	if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye this 15mm fisheye will just be a really distorted wide angle lens due to the 1 6 factor if you love the fish eye style and have that camera you 'll need something wider to compensate for your smaller chip i was disapointed with this lens for that reason the sigma 8mm is great a note to the reviewer below sigma makes some good lenses and bad ones this is a good one and you probably got a bad copy it happens often enough with sigma gear with this lens its good to go and try one at your local camera shop and make sure it has the style you want bring your camera with a chip in it and take a few shots and go home to check them out decide if you like the style and if that piece of glass is a good copy i got a good copy and was still disapointed because of my lack of knowledge sounds like you got a bad one	14
1	this cd has alot of tight hits including nann by trick daddy and who dat' by j t money there are too many good songs to name for this cd those are the biggest i like and i like all the others too i can practically just listen to the whole cd without stopping it which usually never happens with other cd 's b c u buy it for about 3 good songs and all the other songs are junk but this cd has all the hip hop hits that it proclaims i suggest anyone looking at this review or cd to buy the cd it 's worth it definetely ! one last word is that you will have no regrets buying this cd at all i think in my own opinion i am from st louie and i am telling ya 'll to look out for a new group called nelly also there hit single is already out quot country grammar quot and cd soon to be out get that when it comes out to peace out ya 'll	14
0	i placed my order with little time to spare before valentine 's day amazon delivered the item is a timely fashion as usual ! ! however to my disappointment when i opened the box the item came in it looked terrible i though the price was a steal but feel as if i paid way too much for what was received i would not recommend purchasing the item unless you intend to give it to someone who does n't understand jewelry give it to someone for their 10th birthday and you 'll find at least 1 smile in the room i have all intentions on returning this item for a refund as i 'd feel a little embarrassed giving this as valentine 's day gift \( unless it was for my grandmother \)	14

0	do not buy this gun from hot import toys that is my main point it took a very long time to get to me \( 8 days \) and when it did it was broken not that it was shattered or it was jammed it just did n't work the piston seemed to be fine the motor seemed to be connected the gearbox seemed to be in tact the batter \( although a little hard to install \) was charged and the trigger was connected to the gear box i thought that i could return it for either a working gun or just a refund no i e mailed hit over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks nothing ! i got no response no notification nothing i continued e mailing them because they did n't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site ! hit is the worst company to buy from ever ! from what i see and know this gun seems to be quite the mpeg ! i would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately i bet you anyhting that hit will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e mail me back telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they are n't allowed to exchange my product buy from airsplat ! ! ! trust me this is a good gun fast accurate good looking do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive having to find its broke waiting for them to e mail you back and then have to live with a broken useless piece of potential airsoft gun so trust me do n't buy from hot import toys	14
0	paul brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music however content on his latest project white sand is n't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums the artist collaborations on white sand make it tempting to purchase but you quickly realize brown 's musical wittiness and versatility \( smooth latin or r b \) are lacking overall it is still a cd worth paying for	14

0	i 've had the opportunity to watch the movie stealth over the past week it was on tv here otherwise i do n't think i would have watched it my instincts would have been correct an action technothriller stealth has a predictable plot a new elite team of 3 good looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots including a disrespect for authority mayhem ensues people die the leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence and they work together to save the female pilot who 's gone down in north korea the plot direction and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads \( josh lucas jessica biel jamie foxx \) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart i'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads and came away disappointed me \? i was expecting little so i guess my expectations were met though i will say i was amused by the last line	14
0	i must admit the first one that i ate was indeed tasty though slightly undercooked however the second one was much less cooked and when i went to cut it blood from the sausage squirted into my eye now i am beside myself because i remembered my wife going on one night about blood borne diseases i am scared that i might have unwittingly acquired hepatitus or aids my wife told me not to worry because the animals the sausages are made from do not carry these diseases i refuse to take any chances because my wife and i are having problems i still await the results from the blood tests my doctor ordered	14

0	i loved the earlier nevada barr mysteries with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers i was n't as happy with some of her latest efforts but still had n't given up on her now i'm not so sure this latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow the idea that they were from a polygamous mormon sect was a red herring perhaps it was barr 's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate the scenes where anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages each scene was more disturbing the one before it i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends but i have absolutely no desire to re read the end of the book and find out i wish i could say that i would read another nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones but after reading this disturbing somewhat convoluted story i would think twice if i did pick up another anna pigeon novel i 'd make sure i had something else to read if the story took another dark turn i would certainly not stick with it to the end	14

1	well i read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here but i decided to take the plunge and go for it well i'm glad i did all i can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the get go it has its flaws but what phone does n't \? the question is whether you 're going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me let 's talk about the pros and cons pros 1 call quality is excellent no static what so ever no dropped calls my area has good t mobile coverage so i ca n't complain as a phone it does what it 's supposed to do make good quality calls it also pairs with my bluetooth headset \( plantronics 510 \) really well speaker phone is of good quality too 2 internet works great i have the 5 99 plan and yes edge is n't the fastest but it gets the job done it does n't matter where i'm at i can check my email finds restaurants or directions or just surf the web when i'm bored it really came in handy when i was out on vacation and lost wifi works well too did n't want to fork out the money for hotspots though 3 the camera at 1 3 megapixels is decent quality no it 's not going to replace my regular camera but i found it really handy when i forgot to take my camera to my friend 's wedding but was still able to take quality pictures i have n't tried videos yet though 4 mp3 video player now the speakers on this phone are n't the greatest so i would n't use them for listening to music but when plugged into a headset it sounds pretty good i bought a 2gb microsd card bought here at amazon and now i can hold a ton music and movies videos looks pretty nice i 'd have to admit this thing is my travelinig entertainment center i even found a way to play original nintendo games on this thing and have been trying mike tyson 's punchout like back in the old days 5 calendar schedule i had a pda but for some reason i'm more compelled to actually use my calendar and keep my schedule on this thing than i did with my pocket pc probably because of convenience reasons 6 smartphone applications i'm in the medical field and i keep all my medical applications on this phone i can quickly look up drug references or research diseases i really thought i 'd need a touchscreen in order to better navigate these programs and while it might be slightly easier with a stylus i do n't find that it 's all that necessary and still navigate pretty well i just wish the processor were slightly faster for some of these apps but it 's more than adequate and i'm not sure why people do n't think there are a lot of programs for the smartphone programs written for wm5 are compatable with ppc as well as smartphones equally 7 appearance everyone who sees this phone absolutely loves its looks and so do i it looks great and feels great i saw this side by side with the motorola q and the q just looked so much bulkier and well not as nice the rubber backing feels awesome 8 battery for all that i use this phone for it makes it through the day with plenty battery to spare which is all i can really ask for i would n't go 2 days without charging the battery though you should charge it every night cons 1 windows mobile 5 mighty microsoft needs to write a cleaner program however windows mobile 6 is on the way and will be free to download for t mobile customer soon so hopefully that 'll take care of some of the problems i swear just to turn on the bluetooth and pair up my bluetooth device takes me a whole minute just because of how hard it is to navigate wm5 2 volume strip yeah like everyone says it sucks i disabled mine adjusting the volume with this thing is tedious at best luckily my music video programs as well as my stereo headset allow me easier ways to adjust the volume so it 's not such an issue for me 3 alarm clock now i do n't use this all that much but i see what everyone says about it and yeah it 's a pretty idiotic written program however rather than writing half a page on how bad it is i downloaded a free one from the internet that works great so my life now goes on summary so i use this device to make quality phone calls surf the web check email play games listen to music watch movies monitor my schedule check my medical references and take decent quality pictures all this thing needs now is a laser beam that will cut through metal and it 'd be the greatest gadget known to man	14
1	i 've always read lots of books about singles and how to find a mate and that rate has sped up since i'm now a romance coach but somehow i had missed susan page 's if i'm so wonderful why am i still single \? even though it has been out since 1998 the last year i was single myself where have i been and why had n't i seen this book \? susan page writes for involuntary singles straight gay male or female each and every one of us who is single and wishes we were n't relentlessly positive she starts off right to the point with so why are you still single anyway \? and then just when we 've gotten over that shock she states flatly whatever your reasons are for being single if you want to be in a relationship no reason is good enough then page goes about tearing apart every good reason we 've ever come up with to keep ourselves single here 's what page takes on and turns around ambivalence \( my favorite \) those dreadful statistics the myth of there are no good ways to meet people and having and keeping high standards then she works on developing skills in what she calls frog kissing learning to say no how to recognize true intimacy avoiding commitmentphobes handling the intimacy gap and learning to say yes and in the last section keeping it all together while you look page tells you just how to do all that this is easily the best most thorough rounded and positive book about relationships and dating i have seen if you are one of page 's involuntary singles this book needs to be in your library five chocolate dipped strawberries for susan page ! this is quite a book	14
1	this soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film cater burwells score is a pitch perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly also an added bonus of the above mentioned dream combination bartok 's quot allegro quot \( i know diddly about classical music but bartok rocks ! ! \) and a typically great bjork song quot amphibian quot \( in two versions \) that book ends the album with an etherial dream like haze	14

0	i wanted to like this book but i had to give up in the end if the overall vignette concept is attractive enough the execution of detail is n't kosinski ca n't write he tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important whereas the reader is always expected to discover depth in simplicity nothing to be recommended for	14
1	this stuff is wonderful ! i still use a moisturizer w spf 15 but why settle for spf 15 when you can get spf 40 \? this is not a creamy sunscreen that makes your skin feel all oily and like it ca n't breathe instead it 's more on the liquid side and you just quickly rub it in then you can go ahead and put your regular moisturizer and makeup over it it 's lovely and light and you can wear it every day it 's the only sunscreen i have found that has enough spf coverage for my sensitive pale skin but is n't thick enough to clog up my pores and cause breakouts it may seem expensive but not only is the quality of the product worth it but you only need a small amount i wear it during the spring and the summer and after a year i'm still working on the same bottle i was n't sure if it was going to be effective \( not being from a brand that you usually associate with rugged outdoor activity \) but after a week by the beach i was the only one who 's face was n't burned all red even though everyone else had been wearing coppertone and bullfrog facial sunscreen	14

0	i just finished the world 's largest crossword puzzle last night it 's been one heck of a project approximately equivalent to 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles i'm going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall it really is something to behold when it 's all done but it 's also a big undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and perserverance the puzzle itself is moderately difficult but made more so by the fact that somewhere during the revision \( it 's been re done once \) or perhaps during the original construction some errors were made because of this many of the clues do n't match the answers add to that the fact that the author uses many hundreds possibly even thousands of abbreviations that are specific to a certain field \( e g abbreviation used in electrical engineering \) that no lay person ever has a chance of knowing and you 've got what can be an exercise in frustration you can work for hours on one small section and only later find out that the clue does n't fit the answer i'm generally pretty dogged in completing crosswords until letter perfect but that 's not possible here so i had to sacrifice a bit of my honor and force myself to give up after a couple of passes through the ups and downs still it 's about 98 percent solvable which is pretty good when you consider how intricate the puzzle is and how hard it must have been to create overall i enjoyed the process and am pleased with the result if you 've got the time and energy i highly recommend this	14
0	we bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter who just love to make noise with anything she also loves to stick things in her mouth because she 's teething one day she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth the metal from one of the bells cut her lip ! we let her play with the other ones still but the one with the bells is put away at least until she 's older	14
1	i would n't call this a rocker seat the kick stand on it makes it look like a rocker if you put the stand down the legs almost touch the floor you can make it move a little if you have wood floors but not enough to call it a rocker if you have a very mellow baby this chair is perfect my baby likes to sit and stare at the toys but if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm i would n't recommend this chair the music sounds on it is very nice not annoying at all i do n't use the vibration on it yet until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed the only reason i say 4 stars and not 5 is because it is falsely advertised as a rocker other than that it is very cute and my baby enjoys it alot !	14
1	i was n't so sure about the claims that this shampoo bar would make my hair super shiny but i did n't really care either way because it smells very nice and i just like relaxing while i try to wake up \( or wind down \) in the shower anyway it did make a difference ! my hair has been noticeable shinier while using this stuff though i would try lush 's big shampoo if you want to see an even bigger difference perfect format for brining with you to the gym or travelling nothing to spill ! make sure you get one of the little travel tins to bring with you so it does n't soap everything in your gym travel bag \) my only complaint is that it only lasted about a week for me i have medium long hair and did n't use that much i have n't tried my other shampoo bar yet so i do n't know if that 's more of a problem just for this particular bar or if it 's a problem across the board read the reviews and find out !	14

0	i actually saw this movie when it first came out and was so blown away by robert downey jr 's performance \( he was just starting out on his illustrious if self destructive career \) that i did n't notice much else about the movie certainly not jami gertz or andrew mccarthy who are as close to being ciphers as it 's possible to have on the big screen \( the adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids so there is no real dramatic interest there we have only the kids and their interactions with drugs the party scene and each other \) seeing it again 25 years later well downey 's performance still holds up but the rest of the movie is less than zero \( sorry \) the director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes \( unintentionally hilarious in their excesses \) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do and they never develop into anyone we care about the final scene with mccarthy and gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery has no emotional payoff whatever mccarthy says come with me to the east coast gertz responds yes i 'll go with you and the viewer says thank god that means the movie 's over finally james spader does n't play a real character either but as other reviewers have noted he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy glad to see he 's still getting work in a fairly interesting role on boston legal	14

1	i ca n't believe how underrated this movie is ! i never saw it because i had never really heard much about it but when i finally saw it i absolutely loved it along with my whole family ! i'm 20 year old girl so obviously this is my kind of movie but my brother loved it too because the script is so clever ! this movie is hilarious touching incredibly romantic and so beautiful ! ! the cinematography is astounding the sets and the costumes are wonderful and tom and nicole are perfect together they have such great chemistry on screen ! i have watched this movie again and again and it is one of my all time favorites i highly recommend this film ! this is an epic film that should not have been overlooked ! ! !	14
0	i bought these for my 13 year old niece who loves percussion and was so excited to get them for christmas they looked like a great buy well the disappointment was palpable two hours later we got them hooked up installed appropriate batteries etc and the light was on but we could not get any sound from the drumsticks at all which was a bummer but ok if we could simply either \( 1 \) get help or \( 2 \) easily replace them nope the instructions were a tiny folded sheet of paper there is absolutely no troubleshooting no help no nothing i went through everything that came with them but could find anything to help us on next steps or returns etc i finally retrieved the original plastic packaging and found a url in tiny letters for the company but when i went there the site again offered no help tips or troubleshooting \( just a pdf of the really awful original instructions \) there is video on the website showing someone playing the drumsticks but this was no help to us in trying to troubleshoot \( except to mildly disappoint my niece when she realized that you have to drum in the air to get the best results which we did try with no luck or sound again \) i next e mailed the company and got no response i e mailed them again and seven days later the e mail \( in badly worded english \) simply asked me if we had tried plugging in the head phones seriously anyway do not waste your money a terrible product no support and no recourse if it does n't work as it should	14
0	well after i received the book i have to say i was quite disappointed because i am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books after i read the reviews i thought i was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables it turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures if you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed dont buy it the other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented	14

1	i bought this like a ipod but its better i have about 20 movies on it and about 500 songs and some photo's and still have 50 gigs left the only hang up is you still have to go pay another 20 00 to get the plug in download that lets you show most of the movies they say it can do all this stuff but not with out downloads and some add on's once you get all that there are hours of fun to be had	14
0	i have used spyware doctor since version 3 almost three years now i liked the interface and simplicity and the power but as others have pointed out including industry reviews version 4 x was a huge drain on system resources my pc 's would take anywhere from 5 9 minutes to completely boot up with spyware doctor using almost 100 cpu the whole time also my computers would frequently freeze which turned out to be spyware doctor randomly zooming to 95 100 cpu for no reason at all but with version 5 things are so much worse about 3 weeks ago my pc 's lost their ability to connect to the internet browsing slowed to a crawl with frequent timeouts and server not found i spent days on the phone with my cable company and my router 's manufacturer trying to troubleshoot i re configured my entire home network over and over i never made the connection between the onset of problems and my updating to sd5 it was only after finding the pctools support forums that i realized the problem was spyware doctor i removed the program from my pc 's and the problems were gone i had full internet connection and full speed again spyware doctor 5 is causing massive problems for users pctools rewrote the program from the ground up the company says to improve the resource drain caused by version 4 but apparently it was rushed to market even though beta testers reported many of these same problems for weeks i 've uninstalled this software and am basically wasting my subscription and losing money other users are right pctools does indeed auto renew and charge your credit card without warning this is a huge red flag i lost hours days dealing with the problems caused by this program many users have had to reinstall windows completely it 's easy to get caught up in the hyperbole and negative reviews but do n't just take these at face value read the spyware doctor forum at pctools' website these problems are real and it does n't look like they 're going to be addressable anytime soon they 've issued a couple of version updates even removed several of the program 's protection guards but these have n't fixed the problems and they 're not giving any kind of timeline or explanations to users my advice stay away for now but keep up with the forums at pctools' website when they finally get the issues resolved this should be a really strong spyware program pctools has also been criticized for offering a free spyware scan on their website \( actually a download of sd \) which will find spyware on your system but refuse to remove it until you buy a subscription to spyware doctor this kind of sleazy bullying is n't normally characteristic of reputable companies most will give you an actual free trial with functioning software	14

1	the build a figure \( baf \) program of marvel legends keeps on rocking this time build a giant 14 apocalypse this baf is big and cool super articulated with sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture for apocalypse 5 stars for iron fist well he 's super articulated and does come with the mighty booty \( that 's the buttocks \) of apocalypse but really is the weakest figure in this series a lot of that is just charater design though green tights with an open v neck green shirt and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway ballet slippers and a dew rag \? pretty horrible looking if you can try to find the red suit variant at least that 's a little cool also the accesories \( besides the booty \) are two rubbery flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect good luck with that they are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the hands once you get them in you better not touch the figure again or they will fall off overall not the quatlity of figure or accesories i 'd expect but the rest of the figures in the series will make up for this one plus you do still get that booty	14

1	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	14

0	a selfish stupid woman engages in white collar crime and goes to prison for her misdeed i say stupid because she could have paid a modest fine and gotten away with her crime but chose instead to gamble with her and her family 's future by trusting her lot to a jury of her peers they judged her as harshly as i did once in prison she is exposed to life 's realities possibly for the first time in her wretched existence seeing various and sundry sordid occurences beyond her middle class ken she decides to meddle in the affairs of others \( possibly motivated by petty jealousy since she is n't getting any drugs or sex from the handsome male prison guards \) to make a long story short her rabble rousing is eventually heard in washingtonm d c a senator takes more than a passing interest in her and her sentence is commuted to a home curfew i guess the moral of the story is white collar criminals are better suited to country club prisons if you have nothing whatsoever to do your dvd player is broken and you do n't feel like cleaning the oven this movie might possibly entertain otherwise avoid at all costs	14
1	i read scientific american occassionally back in the 80 's at that time i found the articles \( especially the physics articles which i love \) to be especially dense and poorly supported by graphics the quality was there but it did n't quite get across to my younger self now i find the text to be very good and superbly well supported by side matter and graphics i would call this an improvement \( both in the magazine and perhaps in myself \) however i did n't read it regularly back then so perhaps the negative reviewers are correct in saying the magazine has been dumbed down if so then it was from a very lofty level as the articles continue to require a reasonable background in their subject areas for example the article computing with quantum knots was just right for somebody who has read a number of non mathematical treatments of this topic and who like me has read parts of the feynman lectures and things of that nature it was a sophisticated and intelligent article there are many more examples i could give my only gripe with scientific american \( and this has been true for decades \) is that i just do n't like medical articles and the magazine regulary has them this however is a personal matter and reflects my interests not the quality of the magazine i strongly suspect the format was changed as some said because the publisher wanted to improve it for everybody and catch a few more readers certainly i would not have subscribed to the old scientific american it was too dense and too boring now it is just about right for me but that 's me your mileage may vary	14
1	star wars trivial pursuit saga edition \( 2005 \) introduction despite having been around since the middle of the seventies the star wars series has never declined in its popularity george lucas created a science fiction phenomenon that has stood the test of time and then some and needless to say many games have been based on the series video games role playing games and no shortage of board games have been adapted for the star wars universe in 1998 star wars trivial pursuit was released being a die hard fan of the series it was by far my favorite \( non video game \) star wars game ever unfortunately it outdated fast due to the fact that it did n't cover the prequel trilogy it was immediately followed by but in 2005 seven years and three star wars episodes later a new version of the game has hit store shelves ! read on for my review of the new version of star wars trivial pursuit overview quite honestly who does n't know what trivial pursuit is \? well for those of you who have been living under a rock all your life here 's the concept behind the game players alternate rolling a die and moving their game token across a wheel shaped board there are six different colored spaces each color represents a different category the player is then asked a question of that category if he or she gets it right he or she goes again if he or she misses it it 's the next player 's turn at six spots on the board are wedge spaces the objective of the game is to gain a wedge in all six colors and return to the central hub of the wheel and answer a game winning question some changes for this edition of the game are rather obviously the questions and overall game design being star wars based and two dvds which contain the wedge and game winning questions a new concept to the game includes a player being able to steal if another player is unable to answer the wedge question in the last few seconds of time essentially the game play stays play to the classic stylings of trivial pursuit but gives it a star wars overhaul in other words this game is exactly what it says it is review the original star wars trivial pursuit was without question my favorite star wars game of all time that was n't a video game this new version is a massive improvement over the old version for starters the new version covers the entire star wars film saga the classic galactic civil war trilogy \( episodes iv v and vi \) and the prequel clone wars trilogy \( episodes i ii and iii \) all get equal emphasis if you hated the original version for not covering the prequel trilogy that problem has obviously been corrected and in a major way the dvds also add a nice new twist to the game it 's good to finally have a method of setting the wedge questions apart from regular questions and of course you can do anywhere from two to four players or teams i do have a few minor complaints though first of all is the selection of the tokens of characters you can play as the original version had luke skywalker princess leia han solo and darth vader in other words a nice assortment of main characters the new version has luke skywalker darth vader obi wan kenobi and yoda in other words only jedi characters this is strictly a cosmetic flaw but still i think they could have picked a better assortment of characters than those four another complaint is the inclusion of a die for those of you who never played the original version of the game it included an electronic r2d2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces to move when you tapped its head via an lcd screen i liked that better than rolling a die because it helped to give the game a unique star wars feel that playing with a die just does n't have another problem is the price of the game i 've seen it everywhere from 45 to 60 ! even at the lowest msrp it 's still a rip off one of the biggest problems is one of the most obvious if you 're not a die hard star wars fan you will not get very far in this game my last and biggest complaint is with the questions themselves like the original game they are horribly imbalanced some questions are so simple a casual fan could answer them easily some are so difficult even die hards will have trouble with them this brings me to my complaint about the dvd questions not only are these questions really no more difficult than the card questions but as time ticks down the questions become easier ! this makes it ridiculously easy for another player to steal the wedge if the question receiver is unable to answer if i were designing the game i 'd straighten up these flaws but i'm not and overall i am very satisfied with it edition notes this game is a fairly recent release and it remains readily available at most major stores that sell board style games and movie merchandise if you want the game it should n't be too hard just be ready to pay a fairly high price for it overall despite some minor issues this new version of star wars trivial pursuit is a leaps and bounds improvement over the original game if you 're a huge fan of the series who thinks your knowledge of the series is supreme do n't hesitate to buy this game there have been many star wars trivia games books etc over the years but star wars trivial pursuit is the ultimate star wars trivia experience no fan should pass this game up	14
0	when you 're gearing up for suicide this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who 's going to just end it all i found myself suffering nightmares fatigue misery and paranoia my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head this is not a good album for the stressed because it will just make you feel worse i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable after listening to it more and more i started to get more into it but i ca n't say i found it a good place to be in it 's a somewhat interesting album but it mostly just dragged me down made me nervous numb and hurt my head people say this is great music let them say what they want give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that does n't make a pest of itself kid a is just ok to me and has n't been worth all the effort to get into this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners i do n't know maybe i'm missing something but to hear some weird music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears try passengers by u2 and thom york sings like a muppet on this album by the way i 've enjoyed radiohead 's first three albums quite a bit \( including pablo honey why are people always busting its chops \)	14
1	i subscribed to this magazine at the same time as the conte nasttraveler and i'm going to keep this subscription and let the other one expire this magazine has articles about places not about \( as one other reviewer wrote \) articles about martinis fashion etc it also has a lot less advertisements and when there are ads they are relevant more to travelers it probably all boils down to what kind of travel you prefer to do and read about but for me this magazine is my preferred one	14

1	unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions you should n't use this i have oily normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me it is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients but beware this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing it is not in my opinion as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin and does not contain the retinyl palmitate both are good but kinerase cream is better	14
0	we purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them right out of the box the seat pad would n't stay on the seat and slides around during use i figured i could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway after only 5 or 6 uses however the clip that holds the seat belt adjuster to the booster snapped while installing the seat into our second car a few days ago i tried to contact evenflo to report this problem but they were completely unconcerned about the failure of their product they told me that they only warranty the seat for 90 days from purchase \( and you have to have proof of purchase \) they did offer to send me out a replacement part but under the circumstances i do n't feel comfortable using the seat at all so i 'll be destroying and disposing of it i explained that we were thinking of replacing the seat with a different evenflo model and asked if a discount coupon was available to reduce the cost of replacing the defective seat but they told me that out of warranty it was no longer their problem thank goodness this part failed while installing the seat and not during a crash or my son certainly would have been seriously injured we have n't had any problems yet with the other seat but i 'll be replacing it anyway just to be safe after their horrible customer service i wo n't be buying another evenflo anything ever again	14

1	the petrified forest is a filmed version of the 1935 broadway smash the play starred leslie howard and humphrey bogart and their stage performances were preserved when warner brothers bought the play to the screen in late 1935 the addition of bette davis made good box office sense as she was beginning to hit her stride and was reteamed with howard after their earlier matching in of human bondage the film is set in the arizona desert a killer on the run holds up in a road house taking hostage a group of people there the play has a few things to say about the meaning of life with the juxtaposition of outcast wanderer and intellectual alan squier played by leslie howard and vicious gangster duke mantee played by humphrey bogart the morality is fairly corny now and most of it is contained in the dialogue of leslie howard but he delivers it superbly so it still has some resonance the film was a breakthrough for bogart but his performance is too theatrical for my liking davis is a revelation acting with a simplicity and freshness which is almost unique in her career she is also very well photographed by sol polito and her big eyes glow the dvd print is excellent and a lot of extras are included including an expert and very detailed commentary about the film a terrible vitaphone short with the absurd toby wing and a funny cartoon about the cocoanut grove the radio performance included is almost unintelligible with a very poor tyrone power in howard 's role the dvd is excellent value especially if it is purchased as part of the warners gangster collection	14

0	as i read this book when madeline was young i felt as though i was lost wandering through a forest searching for something a beautiful butterfly a perfect flower a mystical cottage but there 's nothing there it 's just a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and nothing mystical at all and that 's how this book is written it is a tangle of thoughts and words spread from the first page to the last nothing special at all i 've read all of jane hamilton 's books i loved the book of ruth adored a map of the world they were both wonderful and i will always have positive comments for them but i doubt i will ever buy another book by ms hamilton it 's not that i want a formula book but i do want to read something that i can relate to and i do n't relate to this at all i do n't like mac the narrator his mother is just plain strange and not endearing or believable at all i ca n't stand buddy his cousin the rest of the characters i barely know and quite frankly do n't want to get to know perhaps i 've changed since her first book came out perhaps the author has but whatever the differences my love of jane hamilton 's books has ended sadly	14

0	i'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing i kept thinking maybe it 's me maybe there 's something wrong with my attention span that i lose interest in these stories half way thru they all seem too long unfocussed what they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories the quality puzzles me because i'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf i read in the zines i have n't followed this anthology over the years but this particular edition imho shows bad selection and worse editing	14
1	maybe because i ordered a medium it works fine otherwise i recommend it	14

1	richard fortney 's earth is a survey in mostly layman 's terms of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth selecting a series of locations where the earth 's geology is apparent and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy preceeds to the hawaiian islands hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the supercontinent of gondwana for each location fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location along the way fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences it turns out for example that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates \( north america ocean bottom and northern europe \) the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney 's historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands the narrative runs a little long at over 400 pages and fortney 's explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader nevertheless this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history	14

1	this is a wonderful overview of a critical sector of the western front across the region known as flanders three particularly brutal battles were fought during the first world war with a horrendous loss of life suffered for minimal territorial gains this book provides enough information about these battles to be informative yet unlike many military histories it avoids becoming boring because it is not overly detailed it also discusses the battles from all perspectives including the high ranking politicians the often inept generals but especially from the viewpoint of the poor infantrymen who suffered incredible hardships including shelling bombing machine gun fire gas attacks and wretched weather conditions in addition the author has a wonderful approach to writing making the book a very absorbing read that is difficult to put down it is a shame so many historians including such military writers as david glantz do not emulate groom 's style	15

0	this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this it adds virtually nothing to xp too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition that would have been worth the money but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product the themes are nice but far too few for the price the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff too bad could have been something but in its present form not worth the money	15
0	i agree that this is a beautiful product however i returned these earrings not long ago the reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring i tried to wear them but the half arrow was too big and i could n't get them through my earlopes	15

1	i have to say that i have been converted for over 15 years now i lived with a razor i have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too i am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon i have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5 1 blade i have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the gillette brand is the best type of razor but now i find it 's not the best shave i used an electric shaver several years back it was one of the top of the line norelco with the incorporated gel it gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs i ended up having to shave as normal true story i am a manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item i was marked bad was my personal appearance not that i dress bad or not wear deodorant but that they felt i did n't shave often \( i shave at the very least every other day usually every day \) so i felt i had to so something about it i researched electric shavers thinking i could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer i found that panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had the instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut i have been using it for almost 30 days now and i will not live without it i have never had this close of a shave before i can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow my fianc has found a new love for touching my face and i seem to be getting more kisses too ! during the first 2 weeks i had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old gillette but today officially i was able to through my gillette away for good \( my boss has even asked what i am doing different and when i told him he went out and bought one too he also loves it now my fianc said she would leave me if i stopped using the panasonic it 's a good thing panasonic has been around for decades \) so i am raving about his product but every good has its bad what the bad \? well it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave but for the amount of time i am planning to use it and the money i am saving from buying razors every month i can handle that the cleaning system is very good but it takes very long to clean \( 2 3 hrs \) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles the cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week i have not gotten to that point yet but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash i just end up using the base for the drying cycle which is an option the batter is very good in the month i have used it i have charged it twice but it really did n't need it as it said the charge was good overall excellent product could there be a better shaver out there maybe will i ever know at this time i am not worried about it i am very satisfied with this panasonic and do n't think it can get any better this product does not include the cleaning base i do recommend it as even if you do n't use it to clean the razor you can use it to dry it it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying but if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor this is it !	15
1	i absolutely love these paci keepers and highly recommend them they are the only ones that my son does n't manage to rip off of himself i got so tired of trying to reach over the backseat to find a dropped paci while my son was in a rear facing car seat that made for a horrible trip i purchased these and they are awesome !	15

0	i really dislike this software i'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way first when you initially select files and folders your disk choices are c or all i have several disks and i want to pick and choose but this program makes that really difficult then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up choose carefully because you wo n't be allowed to change it later ! and if you want to do incremental backups be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save because you ca n't do it later basically the entire job future backups and all must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over	15
1	the smoothest cup of coffee i have ever enjoyed mild yet distinctive in character with a fine finish \( the aftertaste in the mouth after you swallow \) on a recent visit to costa rica my wife and i visited a britt coffee plantation on a very well prepared tour we were shown the origen and migration of coffee cultivation in addition we were shown what makes a great coffee great 100 arabica beens grown at high altitude plantations whose soil contains volcanic ash the roasts were explained in the following terms light roast the smooth tasting coffee with the greatest caffein content tastes similar to chock full o' nuts coffee medium roast more full bodied dark roast stronger taste similar to many after dinner coffees french roast stronger yet fullbodied as you would find at retail coffee shops	15
0	i was quite disappointed by this book i was expecting something with more professional level content it 's all very amateur however the artwork used in the examples is sub professional at best i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific pre press issues relating to comics artwork but the chapter there was frustratingly slight you would be much better to buy a a more general pre press book the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much	15
1	this was one of the first hiphop albums i ever purchased and i still listen to it today i think that krs 's style was best suited to primos production once he lost primo \( with the exception of a few albums \) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack mcs that deserved it this was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his bdp days as well as few musical lyrical tricks up his sleeve this album along with any other bdp release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into hiphop this was the era that i belive hiphop was the best about 93 98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now i wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper	15
1	i do n't know what the complaints about this product are it seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles this is not the purpose of this product i use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out and it works wonderfully no matter how much you move your head it stays in place but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look and when you brush your hair out at the end of the day it feels like you never put it in hair stays soft and feels clean the reason why this gel is thinner is that it is n't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels and it spreads out easier	15
1	whoever designed this toy really understands the mind of the toddler my grandaughter took to this instantly and it became her favorite activity yes activity at a time when so many toys are designed to keep the child in one place this one gets them up and moving no moving no peek a boos ! it contributed significantly to her becoming steady on her feet and building a healthier baby a good value at any price	15

0	the writing seems to have come from under educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool i was n't sure if i was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles this magazine is n't for men it 's for boys however the one star is for the photos of the women which we ca n't deny both men and boys can appreciate	15

0	i had never heard leonard cohen 's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers songwriters given his status reputation i thought i should get this cd and learn what all the fuss was about having had no preconceptions i have to say i was quite disappointed i think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best specific example that speaks volumes listen to cohen 's singing of his hallelujah and then listen to jeff buckley 's cover of that song on grace which was recorded in 1994 sorry leonard you cannot hold even a birthday sized candle to jeff buckley 's rendition of your own song it is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of cohen 's legacy tant pis vers le bonheur	15
1	excellent product and the amazon deal \( free shipping and a large price drop \) made it a no brainer the unit is a rugged very flexible charger from a major company in the business the de sulfinization \( or is it de sulfation \? \) battery conditioning feature can bring back a battery you would otherwise have to replace \( i 've used it successfully already \) and the 65 amp boost mode can start a car with a weak battery that you would otherwise have to jump \( used that too \) i'm very satisfied with this unit it 's light years ahead of anything near the price i paid that i would find at sears	15
0	i truly wanted to like this book after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i 'd feared but downright enjoyable in addition i 'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last alas it was all down hill from there overall this is one of the worst books i 've ever forced myself to finish this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack author of two other published novels and a short story collection director of a university level creative writing program long term teacher of writing and holder of a ph d in same all to considerable critical acclaim she should be correcting and grading \( failing \) garbage like this not producing it so what went wrong \? how did this novel end up so awful \? the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things length if brevity is the soul of wit this novel 's witlessness is easily explained at 666 pages \( interesting number that \) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been it would seem that to some extent like melville before her naslund confused length with importance but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self parody somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing with a meat axe or a chainsaw the name dropping one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures but if badly handled these encounters can un suspend disbelief and downright offend they are badly handled here an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid nineteenth century new england and those she does n't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund 's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne one or two of these developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude as it is it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor \( or the self awareness \) the politics even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing however naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day \( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day \) from slavery to whaling from feminism to free love from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled all without consequence or even criticism this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today which is to say none the anti christian bigotry there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish the bigoted the future apostate or the mentally ill it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi religious idea of the time except christianity the farfetched scenarios i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi lesbian encounter after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her \( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand \) una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal minded aunt and uncle encounters two young men who both fall in love with her disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them successfully avoids detection is sunk by a whale survives by committing cannibalism marries the surviving young man after he goes insane and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians leaving her free to marry captain ahab \( una never really marries anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes \) things do n't get more realistic in the second half which includes una 's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale riiiight the mary sue however the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a mary sue that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader a more realistic main character might have saved it una never learns anything from her life 's too many to be believed experiences because she already knows everything she does n't change because she is already perfect she does n't have to deal with the criticism of others because she does n't receive any and she does n't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides una had her reasons \( and they were very good ones you can be sure \) the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it i feel like i 've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom with the door locked	15
0	once again probably a great product but since i never received it i can not give it a fair rating	15
1	had looked at this lens both at the camera shop and on line and finally decided after much comparison with other lenses to finally purchase it have'nt regretted it one bit this lens is clear with excellent color saturation and sharpness without any or minimal post processing coupled with an external flash it 's great indoors as well have been using it as my everyday walk around lens zoom range is excellent \( rebel xt xti 1 6 magnification \) though it 's somewhat on the big side it wo n't tire you out carrying it around your neck purchased the hood seperately which for the money should have came with the lens anyway this lens offers excellent value for the money and you wo n't regret the investment	15
0	before you buy be sure to check where the pen was made i have a number of older cross pens that say usa near the top and they are great pens however i have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made and they are of inferior quality the top and bottom halves are loose and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap the first one i got i sent it back to cross for warranty repair under their lifetime guarantee only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine and a handling fee attached i was willing to believe it was simply an anomaly one bad pen so later on when some new colors came out i bought two more only to see that they have the same quality defect my advice if you want a good cross pen go to the secondhand store and buy one that was made in usa they are n't making them the same anymore	15

0	i did not like this movie i know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity nonetheless i found it very disturbing his lack of concern for his wife and children how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have a bit on the side and what about her kids \? apart from the first scene we never see them again she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man i'm not a prude really but this film left a bad taste in my mouth	15

0	contrary to the maker 's claims this product is not made with whole grain flour instead the first listed ingredient is organic unbleached wheat flour an unhealthful refined carbohydrate the product is sweetened with common refined cane sugar and corn syrup all things considered this product is nutritionally equivalent to common grocery store fig newtons except for the claim that it 's organic snacks like this could be made with healthful nutritious ingredients unfortunately this one is not i would not choose to buy it again instead of this junk snack i would choose barbara 's whole wheat fig bars which are made with real whole grains and sweetened with fruit juices	15

1	miss saigon is my favorite all time musical ! i was hesitant when buying this recording because in my mind lea salonga is and always will be kim ! but i was pleasantly surprised joanna ampil as kim holds her own while she does n't have the vocal range of lea she has a beautiful crisp voice which she uses to emote the emotional turmoil of kim she expresses herself in a way that makes you feel her love pain and anguish and in turn she makes this part her own the rest of the cast is superb \( especially the amazing ruthie henshall as ellen \) but make no mistake this show belongs to ampil ! i also fell in love with some of the material left out of the lcr there a beautiful bridges and songs which enrich the story back in town stands out for me because of the gorgeous melodies anyone who has fallen in love with the story of miss saigon will appreciate these added gems ! this cast recording is definitely worth a listen !	15

0	this camera was great at first and very easy to use however the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well when we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture so we put it in our cedar chest \( we keep our house very dry and do n't live in a humid area nebraska \) this worked for a few months but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless i wish it was different but bottom line this is a disposable video camera a nice one but still disposable	15

1	i wrote a rave review of these the day i got them they were absolutely terrific and gave me purchase doing yoga on a slippery rug however the next time i wore them for a longer session they got stretched out my toes kept falling out of them and they became twisted around my feet and just generally got in the way i put on a new pair for another session and when doing any lunges or poses with my legs in a wide stance they were very uncomfortable oh well the concept is great but they do n't really work unless you 're doing very little movement i wish someone would come up with something like this that does the job	15

1	i purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking \( which i usually never do usually i just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing \) i came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product of course you could acomplish this with ms paint if you really wanted to one of the main \( and only in my opinion \) advantages to this program is the amazingly vast variations of tones available to make your art more interesting that alone makes it worth the 50 dollars you put into it one downside is that this program because of it 's many tones uses and requires quite a bit of space when i uploaded it on my laptop it slowed down significantly so much so that now i load it when i want to finish a nice drawing and the delete it from the computer again ! xdoverall it deserves about 3 4 stars	15
0	i bought this product based on independent reviews by consumer and pc magazines the product 's performance was ok but customer service was a headache the serial number on the cd that was shipped to me came up as invalid when i tried to install the software i had to call customer service who gave me two more serial numbers before the software would accept one as valid now one year later i want to upgrade my software to the current version \( to save over a new purchase \) and guess what \? my serial number is invalid and in order to upgrade via the trend site i will have to pay more than what amazon would charge me for a brand new cd i will most likely switch to zonealarm because of the hassles involved in registering and upgrading this product	15

0	i do n't usually make a point to watch films this bad \( predictable plot laughable dialog horrible music soundtrack etc \) but when i saw that my all time favorite actor jeremy brett had a brief but memorable role in shameless \( originally titled mad dogs and englishmen \) i could n't resist it 's a bizarre experience to witness an actor who so perfectly embodied the iconic sherlock holmes in the beloved granada tv series appear in such an odd role of a drug supplying sugar daddy it 's even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern day sexual scene with a young woman regardless as usual he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it i only wished the director has used brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric a young elizabeth hurley makes a mediocre attempt to portray a bored little rich girl with drug problems and c thomas howell does his best to seem sexy in a grunge biker kind of way but brett 's booming voice subtle expressions and dynamic presence wakes you up for just long enough to pay attention to his character once he disappears from the screen you realize all too soon that the rest of the film is worthless it takes a great actor to lift up a role from the muck and i'm sorry to see that this was brett 's only chance to do a modern day storyline from his usual historic epics before he passed away he briefly commented in an interview why he did the role and soon realized the film was a disaster on mad dogs and englishmen \( 1995 \) i was mad to do it but i wanted to show the world that i was still alive and i could do other things apart from sherlock holmes i hope they do n't release it	15
1	well i must say after purchasing the linksys wga11b wireless b game adapter that while yes this adapter is overpriced it does work and considering that i only got the linksys adapter to work once and then it shut down in the middle of an update i must say the price looked worth it i ca n't vouch for your financial situations but after speading nearly 3 days trying to set up the linksys when my wife finally said i should get this instead this hooked up and connected instantly no problems and i guess for the price it does look nice hooked in to the back of the xbox so you may not have as many problems as i do with the linksys but if you have any questions or limited computer networking ability this will be worth the price \( only because nothing simplier does exist \) so i would recommend this product if you want true plug and play which i do n't believe the linksys to be i'm sure plently of people are happy with the linksys it just did n't work for me so think first to avoid paying for both i would go back and never buy the linksys if i could	15

1	castlevania dawn of sorrow is the latest iteration of konami 's decades old franchise and the first to appear on the nintendo ds do n't let the title fool you this really is n't the dawn of anything except maybe a bunch more castlevania games on the ds and the subtitle here is simply a workable way to include the letters d and s in the title of the game as seems to be the requirement for the platform at this point dawn of sorrow actually takes place a year after the events in aria of sorrow which came out in 2003 on the game boy advance if you 've played that game or if you 've played just about any recent castlevania game actually you 'll be right at home with dawn of sorrow because it 's basically the same game repackaged to fit the ds that is n't a bad thing though because the castlevania games have long carried the torch for good old fashioned 2d side scrolling gameplay and dawn of sorrow keeps that flame burning as bright as ever the star of dawn of sorrow is soma cruz the young adventurer who narrowly avoided becoming the next dracula in aria of sorrow soma has the ability to collect the souls of monsters he kills thus inheriting their powers a year after soma escaped dracula 's castle a mysterious woman named celia shows up and attacks him celia is a priestess of a new cult that is attempting to resurrect dracula since soma already proved once before that he 's capable of foiling the resurrection of the dark lord the cult decides to eliminate him before he can mess up their plans as well soma survives the attack quite easily and celia is forced to retreat apparently soma does n't take kindly to people who try to kill him so he sets out to find celia and prevent her from reviving dracula the entire game takes place at the cult 's base which is a replica of dracula 's castle in true castlevania form you 'll start off relatively weak with only a knife and some mediocre armor as you progress through areas of the castle you 'll fight monsters and search the mazelike hallways where you 'll gain experience as well as find new and better equipment as you gain experience you 'll level up and your stats will increase in attack defense strength constitution intelligence and luck throughout the game you 'll also collect the souls of monsters you kill these souls can be equipped to give soma new abilities there are three types of souls you can equip as well as ability type souls that grant you special powers without having to equip them ability souls are collected when you defeat bosses and these abilities are usually required to progress through the game by using these ability souls soma can learn how to double jump move underwater and break crystal blocks all of which are required to access certain areas of the castle castlevania dawn of sorrow sticks close to the tried and true formula so it will be an instant hit with anyone with an affinity for the sort of explorative gameplay the series is known for while it does n't do much to distinguish itself as the first castlevania on the ds the updated look excellent music and added controls help to refine the series even further the bottom line is whether you 're familiar with the series or not you ca n't go wrong with dawn of sorrow	15

0	i really wanted to like this lantern it is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price but the light output is pathetic the package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it but i find that doubtful the light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob princeton tec or photon in fact i think you could read a map or a book play cards or follow a trail more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights i'm returning mine	15
1	first of all i would like to say that i was very reluctant to buy a sony camera after doing a lot of research for my needs i ended up with canon 800is and sony 's new toy t100 ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but i wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs sony t100 is the best looking camera i have seen it 's features are awesome compared to it 's small size you can take it everywhere big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight it takes good indoor pictures too i tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good but then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me the auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything sometimes changing auto iso helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes \( which would be 99 of the time atleast for me \) it wo n't make difference just point and shoot you get a perfect image for viewing on computers no complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about 80 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting it does n't have touch screen like t50 and so it 's responsiveness is better i would like it bit faster though also camera takes pictures at very fast rate and the first picture you take is less than 2 secs i would highly recommend this camera to anyone who can afford it	15

1	i would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years into eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here ! ! i think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is tim roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful \( ive learned some of their songs this way \) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans you just never see that these days and the rest of this band has so much talent stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting plus jims drum work how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well this album plain rocks it should be known as these guys were on gigantour and rocked there too be cool if them and annihilator went on tour i have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un original bands that all sound the same !	15
1	after switching from mac os to windows a few years ago i needed a pc oriented magazine to get me well versed in the new vernacular i took a look at pc magazine and was disgusted by the number of errors and the dearth of useful content man i thought this is why mac users laugh at pc guys then i picked up pc world at the suggestion of a friend and wow within minutes i filled out the subscription card and sent for my subscription pc world is good because it 's informative and useful it covers things you want to know as a pc user it does not slant toward hardware \( like the modders only maximum pc \) or software and it does n't waste space telling you why you should buy a mac g5 which oddly enough pc mag tries to do pc world is a well balanced informational magazine for general pc users if you want more expert oriented stuff you might want things like windows mag or other more specific magazines but for general computing pc world is the best each issue is packed with stuff you can use either in your daily computing or to impress your friends at the new year 's party	15

0	time has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage and recent years have only accelerated this trend in the 60s and 70s it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend \( originally it was considered quite conservative \) but as the years go by it 's degenerated into more and more pop culture fluff with little substance as for its being part of the liberal media this is inaccurate recent coverage of the \( 2004 \) election has attempted to reduce the democratic candidate to the status of a non person the first debate between john kerry and george w bush was not even covered except for one very brief article listing a few fact check points instead the cover story wa about new products and movies a kind of sharper image catalog lite time also gave no coverage whatsoever to the election in afghanistan it was mentioned in passing in another article about the u s election but i would imagine that conservatives would object to the magazine 's ignoring a signficant world event that george w bush has pointed to as one of his accomplishments in office in my view neither candidate received adequate and fair treatment the bias seems to be in favor of mr bush but it 's still mostly bland and superficial your money is better spent on the british magazine the economist which is far more substantive while its editorial viewpoint is conservative it 's sound fiscal conservatism rather than the tent revivalism that currently substitutes for conservatism in u s politics the economist also provides a liberal viewpoint and is the closest i 've found to a \( dare i say it \) fair and balanced approach to the news time can still be entertaining to read but i would n't take what they say too seriously they tend to bend with the political wind	15

1	this is truly the killer application for comic book collectors you get the comic 's whole run from its auspicious origins in 1961 to its current incarnation at the end of 2004 in a tiny dvd that you can carry anywhere the thrill of reading classical issues in all their colored glory is not to be missed particularly for those not reprinted so far i especially enjoyed the impossible man and molecule man origin stories seeing how particular adventures ended is also great fun since i owned some comics from the generally undistinguished 1980s but did n't know how things turned out being able to read the entire john byrne run of the mid eighties was spectacular it 's even better than his work at the x men and almost as cool as the lee kirby years this is so much better than the essentials since it 's in color and so much cheaper plus it includes the original ads and letter pages it also beats the masterworks series not only on account of price but also because it has the original colors it 's as good as owning the complete collection but it will take up less space and hence will generate less nagging from mothers or wives this is a must have item with perhaps the best price quality ratio i have ever seen can it be improved \? sure why not take advantage of the possibilities of computers and create an index of all characters that would allow the reader to see all appearances of a character over the years \? why not create an index of writers and artists so that one may quickly get a view of their work \? cross referencing is the next step the good people at marvel must be working on but there 's no reason to wait for that even as it is this dvd is not just good enough it is great like the fantastic four themselves	15

1	love the program hate the company ! i 've been using quickbooks for more than 10 years i started with the basic edition since i am a very small business and use only a portion of the program specifically customer and vendor lists invoicing a r and purchase orders overkill is an understatement quickbooks pro is much more powerful than i need i do n't use payroll check printing year end accounting and many of its other functions so why did i purchase such a powerful program \? that 's the rub intuit is not satisfied with its quickbooks users being content with the edition that they are using intuit sales people call all too frequently trying to get you to upgrade to the next higher version \( edition \) of their program they hounded me for years to upgrade from the early basic edition to the then current basic edition finally they dropped support of the product and i had no choice i purchased quickbooks 2005 basic edition in 2005 shortly after purchasing it they informed me that they were no longer going to support the 2005 basic edition and if i wanted continued support i would have to upgrade again this time to the pro edition this january \( 2007 \) i received an email from intuit informing me that my 2005 basic edition would n't run on the new windows xp vista platform and if i switched to vista i would need to upgrade to quickbooks pro i upgraded to a new pc in february as the result of a major crash on my former system and opted to go with vista thinking that i could install windows 98 as a second operating system to run quickbooks 2005 basic the second operating system did n't work out and after seriously considering switching to microsoft accounting 2007 i purchased quickbooks pro i was very disappointed that intuit did n't offer a significant purchase incentive to existing users but they never have in all the years that i 've been using their product even microsoft the shark of sharks offers incentives don't be misheartened i purchased the program from amazon and with rebates and other purchase incentives saved 60 over intuit 's price i could have saved an additional 25 if i had bought on ebay \( had i known it at the time \)	15

1	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with unless you are going for a very shadowy high contrast image this diffuser can save the day it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	15

0	if you are buying this to connect to a nokia phone beware it is a non nokia part and will no easily interface with the nokia software it uses a different chipset than the nokia data interface cable which prevents it from using the standard nokia drivers you may be able to get it working but i have spent about four hours and have not met with success i installed the drivers provided i installed nokia 's drivers i even installed the pl 2303 serial driver but i could not make it work also note that this cable is a serial interface if converts the usb connection to your computer into a serial port so you will likely not be happy with the data transfer speed i would recommend against this purchase spend the extra money and buy the real thing you 'll save yourself some head aches and heart aches god bless you	15

1	kiplinger 's personal finance is a worthy challenge to money magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends helpful financial tips and in kpf 's case a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor i came to kpf by way of the well read hand me downs of one of kiplinger letters \( for which see elsewhere on \) that were pressed into my hands by my mother in law 25 years ago she probably thought that without i 'd lead her daughter into the financial wilderness where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion i eventually migrated up the kiplinger food chain to the glossier kpf and have never left much of the information provided by kpf \( mutual fund and etf results and the liek \) are widely available the same could be said of the investing advice \( look for no loads with low fees diversify do n't bail under pressure \) where kpf excels is in the short articles and tips which have often prodded me to take money and or sanity saving moves two fine recent examples the articles in the september 2006 issue entitled 'buy a 2006 car on sale \? ' and '5 things to ask about silk ties' both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions i'm likely to make in the new year what 's more the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably not the ones you 'd anticipate in terms of marco economic instincts the kiplinger washington editors run bullish though not quite so much as money 's more cosmopolitan posed writers kpf wo n't lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman 's toys either a fact that is well observed by their authors who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or german auto makers do n't get me wrong i read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about kpf if it were my only source but kpf 's monthly arrival is still always welcomed as it has been for years it remains firmly entrenched in my top tier	15
0	i unfortunately wound up seeing this christmas misgiving on its original airing i have always been a fan of any christmas special since rudolph hit the air way back when each holiday season i hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the new rudolph this is so far away from that you would need the hubble space scope in order to see how close it came the imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise regrettably the story makes santa vs the martins look like an oscar contender such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3d gimmickry you ca n't improve on failure after it aired on tv i did n't see it return in later years on regular tv i did n't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely ca n't win them all	15

1	in the world of gaming there are specialized magazines for each system \( playstation magazine xbox mag etc \) most of which suck because they only report on \( duh \) games on their respective systems others like electronic gaming monthly encompass most systems but only do it half assed not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it then there 's gameinformer there are many things that set gameinformer apart from many other gaming magazines 1 \) they have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play if the game sucks they say so if it 's an awesome game they 'll tell you about it 2 \) matt helgeson \( senior gaming editor \) and the other editors actually inform you about the game 's most necessary attributes its esrb rating \( e to m \) their rating for the game \( from 1 to 10 \) and a brief introduction to the game 's faults and successes best of all however they include screenshots from the game and most screenshots rock these are just some of the reasons that gameinformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market i have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only and i hope my review has explained why	15

1	i had a small version of salad shooter it was great used it for so many years but now the blade was dull and i kind have to push the veggy into the machine to be cut them i decided the next salad shooter i buy should be slightly larger so i bought this salad shooter professional series which is great having some features that are so important in a kitchen where cooking takes place almost every day multiple cones to change large feeding place for the veggy fast light eassy to clean including in the dishwasher still small enough to store in small spaces efortless to cut and shread your veggy no need for knife and cutting board what i like the most about this product is the fact that when i put veggy in it to be cut shread the machine almost vaccum them in to be cut so i do not have to push it in probable du to sharp blades an fast speed of rotation of the blades this way your work is done in no time in my oppinion it is a tool you must have in the kitchen	15

1	that 's just it i love this product and i am so happy that we purchased it it saves time and space and is very safe for my children we bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful	15
1	this is a great product the only reason i do n't give it a full five stars is that it is alleged to not have 'significant' amounts of vitamin e which is supposed to be its selling point i however buy it because for the five years or so that i have used this product i have gotten a lot of compliments about the firmness of my skin and since i have started using it my skin has actually become less oily than when i first started using it i first purchased this product because of some damage i had done to my skin using a popular acne product my skin looked and felt as though i had been burned by acid i promptly stopped using that product and purchased this cream along with the cream cleanser because i hoped these products would be soothing they definitely were within a matter of weeks my skin started to feel better moreoever it took on a plump more youthful appearance \( no sagging ! \) within a month or so my skin was much less oily than it had been since i first purchased this product i have strayed but have always come back in the winter i use the heavier nightcream and have experienced the same results the regular cream is pink in color and does not smell of perfume texture wise it is heavier than a lotion but still feels slippery to the touch i highly recommend you try this cream	15
1	i really like this mat by hugger mugger the thickness is really nice especially if practicing on hardwood or tile floor i actually purchased mine at tj maxx for 10 buck less than the selling price here the color selection is very nice too my one complaint is that i had to wash it several times to rid the mat of a chemical odor i recommend using an organic soap or spray whenever washing a yoga mat this one in my experience needs to be washed completely dried several times for it to have a fresh scent all in all i say this is a fine product however the very best mat imho are ecomats which are made from jute plant much more expensive than this one but well worth the price	15
1	i love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch they are very milky and personally i think the watch would look better without them at all if that 's the only quality they had great looking and i'm glad i finally bought it for myself	15
1	after finishing both half life episode i and the chronicles of riddick escape from butcher bay over a few days i was looking for another fun first person shooter game that would let me pass away an hour or so a day and allow me to unwind by slaughtering a constant flow of enemies with high powered weapons without resulting in the actual murder of innocent people i 'd heard that far cry was pretty good so i bought it installed it and got ready to blast the first thing i noticed is the astonishing graphics engine it 's without a doubt the most beautiful environment ever created for an fps my jaw was on the floor for the first few hours checking out the ridiculously high detailed environment the outdoor scenery looks like a paradise holiday destination with crystal clear blue water and lush green jungle there is birdlife fish and a general feeling that you 're running around a living breathing world one thing was very different right from the start and would play a major role in later missions there is no save game option ! there are checkpoints littered around the levels but it can occasionally be around 10 to 20 minutes of solid game play between them at first this just annoyed me since i found myself reloading over and over on some of the harder missions i could n't just run into the fray firing my weapon left right and centre at anything that moves because one headshot would send me back a heck of a long way in some instances i was forced to change my style of play from all out assault to a stealthy crawling breath holding sweating nerve wracking approach i rediscovered the part of myself that loved thief the dark project so very much all those years ago yet i still got to combine that approach with levels of general carnage when it was simply unavoidable i am now a firm believer that the save game option should be removed from many other \( not all \) first person games out there as it raises the intensity level dramatically the story itself is fairly average and the dialogue even more so which is really what places far cry below the likes of half life you are basically just following instructions the entire game used as a violent killing machine with no real choices but for some reason i just did n't care as i was so absorbed by the surroundings and simply surviving that it did n't lower my enjoyment the enemies have very good ai flanking me whenever possible and generally actually trying to avoid being shot rather than running straight at me there are plenty of occasions though where an enemy will just stand there in the distance while you shoot them from plain sight but generally all is good the weapons are fantastic being both highly effective and satisfying to use the sniper rifle as always is a personal favourite and this game makes awesome use of it with massive maps of open ground while initially i was prepared for a standard serious sam type of game far cry turned out to be so much more some fantastic graphics inspired level design forced variations of play and some fiercely intense gunfights make this game an absolute winner you can add value for money as well since there are 20 long missions to get through with no save option those 20 will take you a long time to complete but you will love it ! i sure did	15

1	with the birth of our first child there were tons of little toys lying around all the time from teethers to rattles stuffed lovies and blocks the traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside how sturdy it was and how much our baby loved looking at it ! with bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin there is even a fold out flap with a play space and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket the fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble shingles this was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips best of all there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside ! it is soft and collapsible yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys it can be very gently machine washed but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy i gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby 's toys i give this 5 stars without hesitation affordable and totally functional	15
1	just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket it is rice we have prepared numerous times in another \( cheaper \) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop the rice that came out of the zojirushi was absolutely perfect ! as good as any i have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to china i was astounded none of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker just perfect plump fragrant rice the countertop stayed clean as well did n't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker clean up of the cooker was easy top notch excellent product you ca n't make better rice than what this thing produces	15
1	there are two different types of larkin poem the first type mostly written before 1955 are influenced by yeats and auden and are mediocre the second written when he found his voice are amongst the most wonderful works of english literature ever written so what was his voice \? basically that of twentieth century man atheistic obsessed with sex regretting the loss of faith and the old certainties he takes these subjects and turns them into glorious poems but here 's the really incredible thing he uses ordinary uncomplicated language no tricks no arcane allusions just plain english it ca n't be denied that the voice is bleak and it is too uncompromising for some however those who like looking into the heart of darkness will find poems which they will remember for the rest of their lives	15
0	okay so in the beginning i was so excited about this perfume it smelled amazing and the scent lasted forever when i say forever literally forever you spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep \? it lasts until the next afternoon it 's not even just a weak scent that 's left on you it 's like as if you 've been spraying it constantly but here 's the bad part after using it for awhile i felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong i felt like the scent was a little too deep it 's great for people who like strong distinct scents if not though this is n't the product for you	15

0	do n't know about anyone else but the dvd i purchased had lousy video the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either i know the concert was indoors but i 've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem	15

1	it took cancer to wake me up i now do everything i can to inform my family and friends of the of the importance of a health lifestyle and eating habits this author also wrote what you do n't know may be killing you these two books are great to accidently leave at a loved ones home they are filled with tons of improtant messages and very easy to relate to examples are given that help you understand what actually is happening to your body my dad has gone from drinking no water to probably half of what he needs but this is a start he will read more the next time i leave another book by accident this author is great !	15

0	our family has the original leappad and recently purchased a leappad plus writing i must say that there is no comparison between the two products and the original leappad system is by far superior my kid love playing leappad however the addition of a graphite pencil is a mess ! once the pages are written on you can never get them completely clean and also younger kids have a hard time erasing it all together if we were to do it all over again we would have purchased a second leappad system and not bothered with the plus writing	15

1	i love this stroller and tell all of my friends about it our daughter was about 3 months old when i purchased it there was not a better rated stroller available when i researched and there still is not you can run walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe lilyana is now 4 1 2 months and loves going for our daily walks and occasional rollerblading she is a fussy girl \( only \) when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of bob we live in florida and with the sun guard canopy she is well covered some other factors which made we chose bob the braking mechanism which is hard to find has a wrist strap which if you should fall locks the back wheels \( unlike most strollers on the market \) this feature is great for rollerbladers 5 point safety harness 70 pound weight limit \( highest that i found \) metal frame \( others have more plastic that metal \) shock absorbers great of rocking bouncing her to sleep swivel front wheel which locks with a simple pin simple lily likes it and we tried several others all that babies r us has in stock the cost is pretty high but would you put a price on the safety of your child if you were to fall while exercising \? thanks for hearing me out	15
1	i have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door i received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week however the sell by date on each package is a week old they seem to be fresh enough now but i am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date it also makes me wonder about other amazon orders and the sell by dates on them i will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life	15

1	i hesitated a good while before picking this game up at a bargain price based upon various reviews and player feedback i assumed that this game would be like 10 hours long a bit buggy and dumbed down fortunately none of this was the case i had some good fun with this over a weekend \( yes it can be finished over a weekend \) and did n't come across a single bug fable is not in the same league as morrowind oblivion gothic 2 or some of the other great roleplaying games \( rpg \) out there but it does provide an enjoyable diversion gameplay the controls are the typical wasd keys and mouse commands found in most single player rpgs the game is fairly easy to learn and navigate the story traces the hero from childhood through adulthood when he 'll have to you know save the world there are no character classes per se but you can roughly play as a warrior magic user or stealth archer character or some mixture of these much of the story centers around a main quest line but there are a number of side quests available unlike most rpgs quests are assigned by quest cards that you pick up at the heroes guild \( lol ! that 's what it 's actually called \) it 's a rather artificial feeling system but it 's functional progression in the game is quite linear in most instances you will not be able to even leave the beaten patch since fences rocks and invisible barriers wo n't allow it compared to more open ended rpgs like the elder scrolls series fable seems restrictive and light weight in this regard overall it 's a decent story but it is rather force fed to you the game includes several interesting touches people react to you based upon whether you 've performed good or bad deeds if you roleplay like a saint you 'll eventually have a halo and butterflies floating around ladies \( and guys \) will worship you and you do have the option to buy a home and marry \( multiple times if you 'd like \) if you play as an evil character you 'll eventually grow horns and fall out of favor with polite company the nonplayer characters in the game at least in the towns have jobs and schedules they work during the day and sleep at night though only quest related characters have anything to say of interest although you can only play the game as the same guy you can customize him with tattoos facial hair haircuts and a \( small \) assortment of armor you can control how your character 's skills develop but not as deeply as you can in a game like morrowind or baldur 's gate there are other small things that you can do such as fish play games of chance and treasure hunt overall this game takes about 20 25 hours to do everything it has to offer so it is rather short for an rpg the things that i did n't much care for are not major but simply underscore the light weight nature of this particular game the game is certainly designed to appeal to the adolescent crowd with hotkeys for burping farting and so forth the various tattoo styles and haircuts further highlight this point there is nothing really offensive in the game it just feels a bit immature in places also the save system is based mostly on the checkpoint model you ca n't save just anywhere \( at least your quest progress will not save \) but the game will autosave at important junctures graphics the game looks quite good character models are convincing \( though a bit cartoonish and often repeated \) and the natural environment is screenshot beautiful in some places since the pathing is fairly restrictive much of the scenary is noninteractive it 's not like oblivion or gothic 2 where if you can see it then you can probably travel to it sounds voice acting is pretty good with the usual british accents that invariably seem to accompany such games the music is particularly well done and appropriate for the various atmospheres ambiant sounds are also decent replayability technical issues the game is probably worth playing twice once as a good guy and once as a bad guy it will play similarly either way but there are different ways to perform certain quests depending on your moral disposition technically the game was perfectly stable on my computer no freezes crashes or other problems the manual is decent and explains much of the game along with the in game tutorial if you like rpg games and can get this one cheap go for it it 's a well polished though simple rump through a fairly well rendered world do n't expect the same character depth engrossing story or exploring options that you 'll find in some of the games that i mentioned above however fable the lost chapters is good for several hours of entertainment	15

1	the mother is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality a woman who is n't ready to stay home watch the telly and vegetates after her husband of nearly three decades and a controlling dominating chap at that packs it in with a massive heart attack may \( anne reid \) is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect indeed demand a future of happiness but she is also inescapably vulnerable she 's fishing in uncharted emotional waters who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand much less resolve in her sixties she 's still a work in progress something 's gotta give showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited after all it 's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich and to insure that no serious psycho social issues were explored keaton 's young girlfriend amanda peet daughter of keaton not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old \( er \) would be lover never hopped into the sack not on this film people probably gasped when may writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover darren \( daniel craig \) or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may when this first came out on theaters i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings' content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her 60s rapturously enjoying sex it 's to be inspected that anne reid 's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others i truly ejoyed this film last night and will never forget it kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy	15

0	i have always had problems with razor burn and shaving issues overall it used to be a disaster and i was introduced and used tend skin for the past two or three years now i got a sample of solution 2 out in the hamptons last weekend and i could not possibly be happier it is a significant improvement over tend skin the roller ball applicator is brilliant and i have officially \( thankfully \) pitched my cotton ball bag it does not sting nearly as much as tend skin it smells so much better \( actually pretty good ! \) and it works better too i used to get very dry patches on my neck from using tend skin but i have had no dryness issues with solution 2 i used to have a strict regimen using tend skin in order to get through my shaving procedure now i roll on the solution 2 and it 's all good \)	15
1	this toy was bought for my son \( 14 months \) because he has an obsession with the phone my son instantly loved this toy and has been a great subsitute when he is reaching for the phone and i'm on it it is a great travel toy as well being in the armed forces we are constantly on the move and he loves sitting in his car seat on the rides and playing with his phone sure this toy gets a bit old after a bit but it 's a small price to pay for your kids true happiness my one gripe with this phone is that within two days of him playing with it he broke the center button that flips the features we returned it to the store and have not been able to find it except online i'm sure it was just a fluke flaw and am buying it again	15

1	afi finally release a live dvd and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now it is very impressive it does lack older more hardcore punk tracks but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the band it is now each album progresses towards more epic scales and songs balance beauty with power i heard a voice captures this on film and the fan gets to witness afi at their most grandiose watching vocalist davey havok sing god called in sick today while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime the masterful command of theatrics from each member especially havok creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate the setlist itself is perfectly put together with the only gripe being the exclusion of kiss and control the rest of the songs display all facets of afi from the fast paced dancing through sunday \( which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist jade puget \) kill caustic death of seasons totalimmortal and a single second \( the last of which features a guest appearance by nick 13 of tiger army \) to the slower paced this time imperfect and endlessly she said as well as all of their recent singles and a few more cuts from their latest releases decemberunderground and sing the sorrow extras are geared towards the fans with despair faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the decemberunderground release as well as a poster each band member has their moments to shine and are all very capable and talented muscians bassist hunter burgan and drummer adam carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals as puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery in this genre over the instrument this is all built up to allow havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you the quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic unlike other live dvd 's where the concert is edited to the point of a music video i heard a voice has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd but also add to the overall effect of the performance the sound is very clear and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix this is overall a very stellar production and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band as well as new fans and casual fans should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy	15
1	this unit works great i bought it for my father and it works like it 's supposed to it has enough juice for a regular size crt tv and has been used to jump start a few times the first unit i bought had a problem with the generator part and would not power anything up i notified amazon and in no time flat ups was back to pick it up and i got a new unit the next day ! great service from amazon ! ! ! and a great product too	15
1	as soon as i saw this watch i had to get it i loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful it 's a really nice looking and good quality watch the only problem i do have with it is that the face is quite big if you have a small wrist it is very large i still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller	15
1	i live in an apartment building and play \( well practice is a better word \) the bass guitar and needed headphones so i would n't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs tv about 6 feet from where i sit and play the 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing so i would n't have to use an extention cable \( and usualy end up with feedback distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable \) the volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so i do n't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings i like to use when not using headphones makes it real nice too when using an instructional cd or dvd i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head very light weight some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads' fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere cord enters headphones on the left ear side so you do n't have to deal with the classic 'y' split cord easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way earpices fit nicly over my ears \( no pinching gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear \) and does a very nice job blocking out noise \( when my wife is awake she watchs the tv rather loudly which is right next to me and i bairly notice it \) plenty of padding around the ear pieces many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear but these headphones i honestly do n't feel anything against my ears even after several hours of use each night sound quality bose or pioneer they are not but then if you wanted such high quality you would n't be shopping in the 20 and under headphones \) that being said they are very good for sound sounded very good on a portable cd player only drawbacks i can see is that a person with large tall ears wo n't get thier ears covered by the earpads the inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1 4 inchs tall by 1 3 4 imo they could have been made bigger also if you have a tall head \( good distance from top of head to ear \) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears i have a head like drew carry \( give you an idea head size shape i'm talking about \) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they would n't have fit i wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones do n't interfere bind pinch or anything like that with my glasses so i highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after \( i do n't recomend things often \) \)	15
1	this is my favorite jazz album of all time put simply this was miles davis at his best the notes on this album simply float and yet it flows together better than anything i 've ever heard the composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense do n't let the thirty second clips fool you i almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading i took a chance on it and it was the best gamble i 've ever made a must have for any jazz enthusiast	15
0	hammerfall is one of the bigger names out there in the power metal world and this cd sounds pretty much like the previous 5 albums the only dofference is that they have gotten worse i write this review to the two groups of people out there the exisiting hammerfall fans and those trying them out for the first time for already existing hammerfall fans such as myslef i strongly urge that you do not buy this cd unless it goes below 3 4 dollars on amazon for those looking to try hammerfall out and get into the power metal genre for the first time go ahead and get this one because hammerfall are by no means bad musicians they can all play very well but this cd lacks refinement and creativity start here and work your way up to the better hammerfall which you will no doubt appreciate more hammerfall keeps putting out the same album over and over and over if you know what i mean all of their songs sound relatively similar but this cd marks one of the lowerest points in their career	15
1	i found this product to be very unique and helpful in that i could quickly remove retain the glasses around my neck being far sighted i have come to need reading glasses and these are perfect for my needs i can look 'down' through them and look 'over the frame' for distance all while they are secured around my head and neck i do hiking using a gps device and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand while also looking forward towards my path of travel thank you for the innovative product	15
0	this is a great idea however if your crib has anything larger than a jenny lind style piece of wood on it it wo n't work we do n't have a sleigh style crib but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch it would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular larger style cribs everyone seems to be making buying these days	15
0	this little scanner is not worth the price it 's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use there is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency large gaps in between the frequency ranges it 's programmed to receive and very limited memory capabilities the small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device looking from any angle and the backlit lcd display is unreadable reception of this scanner is poor on all of it 's \( very limited \) bands though can be improved with the use of an aftermarket antenna the scanner is very prone to intermod from paging systems and other sources the squelch is practically useless on this thing it 's either on or off it seems that any setting in between full and open are pretty close to full as it takes fairly strong signals to break the squelch even when it 's set just above the static level on any empty frequency the sound quality from the built in speaker is tinny and shallow sounding but at least there is a jack for an external speaker on the bright side the chassis is well built and strong the buttons have a decent feel not to light nor too stiff the knobs turn with ease but will not change their settings due to road vibration they stay put where you set them at the fit and finish of the scanner is actually quite good overall but it 's not enough to make up for it 's lacking feature set and poor performance	15
0	loved our marathon until our 18 month old reached down and pushed the release lever and leaned forward loosening the straps and started trying to climb out of the seat since this happened he 's figured out how to climb out with the harness still locked into place just by loosening the harness although a highly rated seat i would think that this would be addressed by a company so proud of their high price tag product i have seen several other same experiences on this site today and am appalled that nothing has been done to correct this not very happy	15
0	laptop mag can be best described negatively it 's not a really serious computer magazine it 's more or less like consumer guide which is basically paid advertising this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers in the end i feel this is a waste of money besides you can get all the info for free on the web from cnet or zdnet anyway	15

0	i have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market edain mccoy who has written some wonderful new age material strikes an off putting note in this one the spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements in several of her spreads she conveys that a card 's placement at a certain point in the spread may or may not mean some karmic element at play the whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define therefore when a card may or may not mean something that interpretation could significantly change on whether you may or may not interpret it that way leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card 's meaning tarot cards are intuitive not rational and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity it is difficult to have it both ways and i found working with these spreads difficult imagine doing a celtic cross reading and the first position may or may not be the root of the issue these spreads speak very clearly to the author but not so to the reader i rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into karma and past lives but the explanations are too ambiguous	15

0	the pros you can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it 's adhesive it allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well does n't prohibit any functions of the ipod \( i e sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on \) the cons bubbles bubbles bubbles i 've carefully applied and re applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime especially on the screen if the screen is not lit up all you can see is bubbles on the screen it does n't do the ipod justice because it looks so cheap when applied after 2 days with this product i'm already looking to replace it	15

1	i agree that veranda has too many advertisements but that 's the trade off for this very affordable high quality publication i'm not sure i'm the intended target for this magazine because i ca n't afford most of the things in the ads but i 've gotten lots of ideas about color layout and accessorizing that i can use and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style	15
0	i 've been a loyal norton anti virus utilities software customer since the stone age but like several other reviewers i'm deeply disappointed that norton internet security 2007 is incompatible with zonealarm pro sunbelt counterspy and microsoft antispyware and even more deeply disappointed that i had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out once upon a time norton was the epitome of well designed thoughtful customer centric software but they 've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well established name i 'll be returning symantec 's software if i can and buying zonealarm 's a v package instead	15
1	i ca n't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars you are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible so you 're forced to shop for one online it 's really not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game it 's really dumb	15

1	this story drew me in at once because of the strong voice and the good writing it clearly establishes a sense of time and place \( modern day madison wisconsin \) and offers the promise of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of als \( lou gehrig 's disease \) from the perspective of a personal caregiver while we learn to understand the struggles of the patient kate this is more about the struggles of a college student known as bec as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own author michelle wildgen fulfills the promise this story is character driven and what made me turn the pages was n't the story which was at times a bit slow and uninspiring with the exception of the blue butterfly the additional sex scenes felt extraneous further one can guess from the beginning that in terms of kate 's condition there would n't be a `happy' ending regardless wildgen paints a very realistic picture of als and definitely puts you in the room what made me turn the pages was wildgen 's ability to make each of her characters come alive i cared about them and wanted to see how they 'd handle kate 's progressive and ultimate demise bec is the narrator who learns as she goes \( both how to take care of kate and how to cook for her guests staff family \) we see everything through her eyes particularly as she becomes kate 's voice the title you 're not you comes from kate as she asks bec to speak for her in a manner beyond mere translation the secondary characters are also well developed including kate 's husband evan bec 's roommate jill and to a lesser degree bec 's lover liam liam a married faculty member represents another dimension of bec 's floundering and her search to in a sense pick a major ultimately the story becomes a vehicle for bec 's eventual direction of career choice i recommend as a thought provoking read and for the strong writing and character development additionally if you know \( or have known \) someone with als i believe you 'll appreciate the author 's knowledge and sensitivity from the author of a line between friends mckenna publishing group	15

0	i own several great digital cameras it seems like i get one for each use one with good zoom another camera for its good flash use in lowlight and others this one i wanted for the high mp in a small compact size that i can put into my pocket the first few photos were great taken outdoors in my sunny patio then every picture i took after that \( same settings fine hq poster 10m etc and vertical lines started showing on the lcd screen and the pictures were all washed out when i download them on the computer they look exactly that way too with the lines and almost all white i 've played around with the settings \( and i do know how to work them \) but still it does the same so time to return to find a better one that 's too bad since i read some good reviews and wanted to have it	15

0	as a child i remember finding this magazine at my doctor 's office and reading it because it was the only thing available it has not changed much there are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content this magazine will neither stretch your child 's mind nor keep him entertained it only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen in the coming era of global connection children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia	15
1	i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars but after watching it again i realized i liked it better \( i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you \) i do not consider all of the performances goth martiya possesion are more tribal than anything \( at least on this video \) and i really dislike the expression or lack thereof on their faces while they are dancing they either look completely bored pissed off or smug i skip right over it i also did not care for asharah 's dance to the drum solo by solace \( opaque \) the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all the music is saying fast big upbeat and she 's standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves and of course we all love the s m piece excuse me s m is not part of the goth subculture and has no place on a bellydance video jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer but she did n't dance much on this and i did n't want to see what was on her part another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music i like solace and all but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre there were a few but not enough for my liking my favorites on this video were tempest ariellah jeniviva and ayshe \( for wierdness factor \) for all of its faults this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose	15
0	movie got 2 3 through and just quit no problem this is windows right \? just reboot and start where you left off only for whatever reason i ca n't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning i'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again only a couple bucks but definitely not worth it	16
1	cast iron pans are the way to go no dangerous non stick materials that emit toxic smoke if you overheat them this one is probably the best i have ever owned only criticism is that it is huge and difficult to heat evenly on a normal size gas burner bacon tends to brown at the center while remaining uncooked on the edges but for pancakes etc this is perfect get this one and a smaller 10 pan and you 'll have bases covered	16

0	i never bought gq back in my 20s because for one thing i never thought of myself as a clothes horse also i actually took the g in gq to mean that it was actually for gentlemen ie sipping champagne on a yacht pass me the the caviar type gentlemen well after now having reached a certain age i find myself going back and forth between esquire and gq and find that in many cases neither are exactly right for me however i think i 've bought my last episode of gq the 2006 interview with will ferrel was interesting for the first three paragraphs and then it became an excercise in self referentialism disguised as an attempt at wit also the politics of the magazine are unabashedly anti bush administration which would be ok except for the fact that i'm not reading gq for political content there are plenty of magazines out there make this their specialty and when i find it in gq its just tiresome frequently swipes at bush and his policies just come out of nowhere in an article as if the editor decided that a jab at bush and his policies might help the piece regardless of its content not to mention does anyone actually wear the clothing they put on display \? 800 tennis shoes \? i fear that i will be an esquire reader i ca n't bear to become a men 's best life subscriber just yet	16

1	the freshman is a very funny movie the central joke is that marlon brando plays a godfather type figure in lower manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character brando so famously portrayed matthew broderick is the freshman an innocent nyu film student who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with brando and his family the funniest scenes involve a komodo dragon loose in a new jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy the movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild bad words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families	16
0	i bought this movie because i thought it would be like the movie version of louis l'amour 's conagher unfortunately it is a far cry from that movie the quick and the dead was too predictable the dialog was stilted and unrealistic and the characters well they were too much in character and not believable i am curious how faithful the script was to the book if the movie is as faithful to the book as conagher was then i apologize to the movie makers and will hold a grudge with mr l'amour instead	16
1	that 's right ! a quote from detective eames on law order criminal intent she and goren were in a garage and she pointed out a chamois cloth and smelled it and that 's when she said meguiar 's the good stuff my father used to use it on his the first time i saw that episode i did n't know what she was talking about but i saw it the other day \( on bravo \) and i got it ! that 's because i have become an avid fan of meguiar 's products since i bought a mercedes 7 months ago ! this product i mostly use on the interior it is like a magnet for wiping the dash and wood trim you hardly need the sprays but they are good too keep one handy in your glove comparment it gives a great shine on the outside whey you use it with meguiar 's quik detailer spray enjoy	16
1	o k these glosses are just plain yummy ! actually they do n't taste like lipglosses at all which is a good thing no one wants waxy orchemical flavored gloss thatmakes you want to throw up right \? all the flavors are amazingly delicious each one tastes just like sweets the colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky they go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle i wish the tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky overall nice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes	16

1	first published in 1936 this is the 12th poirot book the 3rd superintendent battle book and the 2nd colonel race book and has no narrator it 's the first case in which superintendent battle mrs oliver or col race appear together with poirot or each other and the only case in which all do so at once the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes where poirot encounters mr shaitana a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case but it becomes clear that he 's a victim waiting to happen for shaitana like a few other collectors in christie 's universe has succumbed to a foolish temptation and begun collecting people and not just people of talent or genius but murderers and being a connoisseur he collects only the best those who have gotten away with it he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby without naming names and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of tigers \( poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger but would do so from outside the tiger 's cage having respect for the danger \) poirot accepts the supper invitation however to find that there are seven other guests including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers explorer major despard a strong silent type mrs lorrimer a middle aged widow who is very serious about bridge timid young anne meredith and dr roberts a loud and jovial general practitioner shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder but otherwise the subject does not come up and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper arising from the final game to find their host dead stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players ! this is of course poirot 's fantasy case as he once remarked in the abc murders because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another there are only the people themselves and their memories of the evening and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they 'd committed and gotten away with \? rather than following poirot 's viewpoint in third person throughout some chapters follow battle race or mrs oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case each represents a different style battle is a professional police officer race an empire builder type secret agent and mrs oliver a writer of detective stories battle of course has a duty to investigate shaitana 's murder and does so in an orthodox style cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him race deals with checking out major despard the explorer who 's most clearly his kind of person mrs oliver for her part works on worming information out of not only anne meredith but her roommate rhonda \( whose attitude is that anne could 've lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she 'd been paying attention \) and of course there 's poirot he 's really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn pursuing two major lines of questioning \( 1 \) describe how the bridge games played out and \( 2 \) describe the scene of the murder \( the elaborate collector 's room in shaitana 's house where the bridge games were played \) see if you can figure out where poirot 's questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues and what he learned from the responses he received	16

1	i saw the price of this and went what \? \? then i looked at the same recipe that i had downloaded from food network these became a bargain a pound plus of chocolate and a pound of good butter cost a lot more than this package and this gives the promise of almost instant gratification without having to wash 10 dishes i mixed i licked the spoon and bowl i baked and went crazy just smelling them i waited for them to cool i picked off crumbs and bits that increased in size i cut off a small portion and gobbled it i cut off a larger portion and ate it with ice cream i went to the local bakery and bought dessert for my guests i hid the brownies \( never you mind where the car trunk is a great spot \) i went out and bought two more boxes try them they really are the best brownies i have ever had and i have to admit to consuming a fair share of brownies in the last 40 years you will buy a second box i promise do n't think of it as buying a brownie mix think heaven in a blue box	16

0	i got this case for my ws 320m which i 've been wearing around my neck like a mp3 player the material of the case seems to be genuine leather \( or really good vinyl \) and brushed felt it looks good professional looking i 've enclosed what i hope are representative pictures of this case all the buttons of the recorder are accessible even when the flap is closed the microphone headphone jacks are available as are the rec stop play buttons if the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built in microphone you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well there is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the hold button on the side of the recorder not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the hold button however since the hold button is meant to slide down \( away from the microphone \) for it to be released if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case the resulting friction would actually unlock the hold button the belt loop is an adjustable velcro i would have preferred a sewn on belt loop \( so the case cannot come off the belt accidently \) or a nice stiff clip \( for easy access \) or even a riveted snap button but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times the case is closed shut with another velcro strap all in all it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport or being able to put it on your belt after everything else \( line in mic headphone recording playing \) is set up the relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case \( mainly due to very small buttons \) as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case the case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder my bias lies in that i like to use it as an mp3 player and i wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap loop from a flash drive placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such i think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt on one positive note i believe this is the first time that i was the first reviewer for anything from amazon woo hoo	16
1	i loved this show and have been waiting for it to come out on something so i could watch the episodes again i ca n't wait for season two to come out if you were a fan of this show you have to get it	16
1	i disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless i think it easily earns 4 5 5 stars it is over a decade old now and i do n't think it is intended as a source for scholars of english but for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read i ca n't compete with some of the above reviewer 's scholarly points but i do n't think replacing some of bryson 's dogma with their own is worthwhile mother tongue is a great starting point and very educational bryson 's dictionary of troublesome words is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me	16

1	prom night is another of my favorite early slashers i love the disco soundtrack and the whole late 70 's feel of the movie ever since i saw halloween i craved more jamie lee curtis and this gives you a healthy dose the plot is pretty usual but the killer was n't predictable like a lot of slasher movies it 's a horror slasher classic not much gore but still effective can i say as a woman i would never take a ride from a fat boy in a van ! ! jude ! what were you feelin girl \? and in the 70 's and 80 's slashers the jocks usually did n't have any musclesbut the girls always had big go figure anyway buy the movie it 's slasher royalty	16
0	they changed everything ! in an effort to make it more user friendly they 've rearranged most of the controls menus are replaced by headings it is difficult to accomplish what were easy changes before some of this will likely improve with use word 2007 is constantly trying to think for you auto formatting as you type however it often is n't thinking what you are and making it obey your commands is frustrated by the new headings particularly frustrating when i right click on a list to restart numbering at a \( ie after roman numeral ii on an outline \) word 2007 flatly refuses my research paper is now formated i headinga subpointb subpointc subpoinii headingd subpointe subpointf subpointiii headingg subpoint etc etc this is ridiculous and inexcusable ! i also had to individually superscript 130 footnotes somehow in changing the font from the widows default calibri back to time new roman the footnote setting was altered and i have yet to determine how to restore it however if i open a new document it is fine but i really do n't want to retype a 30 page research paper powerpoint 2007 works well enough compared to the older version they have added a few bell and whistles but nothing that gets in the way if you have to buy a new computer you 're likely stuck with the new ms office 2007 but do n't buy it until you have to it is not an upgrade from the previous two versions	16

1	after chatting online for 3 weeks jeff kohlver a 32 year old photographer and hayley stark a 14 year old honors student finally meet in real life at a cozy local coffee shop called nighthawks for a `normal' person just knowing this age different would make you feel uncomfortable and you would think that what they are doing is `wrong' but what exactly are they doing \? nothing illegal yet as hayley attempts to flirt with jeff she is not getting the feedback that she wants sure jeff is replying and some of his replies seem as if they would be very sexual but the way he talks and presents himself to hayley he seems as if he is not interested in her even claiming he would have to wait 4 years for her but when hayley invites herself over to jeff 's home he accepts so he must have some interest in her right \? well he does but he is n't able to make his move as hayley makes her move first after intensive research study and stalking hayley discovered a gruesome past that jeff never wanted to surface which is the only reason hayley met with jeff to do justice to in her own special way our knowledge of jeff and hayley now change jeff kohlver not only a 32 year old photographer but a pedophile and a murderer or at least the accomplice of a murderer hayley stark not only a 14 year old honors student but a vigilante who literally takes the law into her own hands through torture which includes castration stun guns and a call to janelle jeff 's ex girlfriend whom he is still obsessed over hayley digs deeper into jeff 's memory and the complete truth is out hayley gives jeff two options jeff must commit suicide by hanging himself making others including janelle believe he was just some sad lonely man in return hayley will clean up all the evidence that would lead police to finding out his crimes or she will let jeff live and she 'll take off her clothes run into janelle 's arms and the truth about jeff about his pedophilia and about his murderous acts will be out to the public and his name will be put to shame jeff chooses suicide and at the last minute hayley tells him she will not hide his past it is now for everyone to know hard candy is a psychological drama with a very unique and twisting storyline and plot one that makes you question the movies the characters and even question yourself what kind of person are you if you side with jeff \? sure he is a pedophile but does he really deserve all this torture \? and what kind of person are you if you side with hayley \? sure she is ridding the world of 'evil' but should n't she have just gone to the police \? most people just get stuck on the storyline and plot itself and do n't take time to notice the acting dialogue and cinematography patrick wilson and ellen page did an amazing performance i have never seen better and the dialogue is so impressive and so striking some times heart moving as well as heart chilling as for the cinematography the movie is absolutely beautiful the colors the shots really look at it this movie is definitely a favorite of mine and i give it a 10	16

0	i trusted that this software would do what it claimed to do and was so let down by its lack of performance that i am dumbfounded and left speechless during backup process i selected about 15gb of info to backup spanning 4 dvds everything looked fine except for two \( 2 \) simple errors that i received indicating that those related files may not have been copied backed up properly i figured no big deal 2 files errors out 15gb i could handle that based upon the false pretenses that my critical info was backed up properly \( simple pictures videos mp3 files and financial files to include previous years tax files \) i then proceeded to slick my drive remember only 2 simple benign and almost inconspicuous errors during the backup process everything looked great during the restore process i then received numerous errors each of them requiring me to click 'yes' when asked if i wanted to proceed i got tired of clicking yes around the 100 or so mark and decided to click no when you click 'no' everything is undone there is no 'ignore all' function so i had to sit through every prompt and got tired of it and decided that proceeding with 1000 files and answering yes would involve too much pain for me i then selected a smaller group of files to have restored only the 'my documents' folder but ran into the same situation eventually i ran a test on a small folder to have restored and still ran into the errors but pressed through hardly any of the files were received error free and those that had issues were never restored my guess is approximately 2 3 or 3 4 of my files were not restored and of course none that really mattered made it i had the latest update applied to the program so that should not be the cause i would have done better to slick my entire hard drive without going through the backup process as i would have been at nearly the same place but without experiencing all the headaches frustrations and an investment of hours no days of my time the program has been recently purchased by microsoft for inclusion in the vista os i imagine it will do well as a microsoft product as it fails to deliver upon its promises	16

1	this machine replaces a semiautomatic delonghi which i thought was decent well after using this for 3 weeks i can honestly say that my old machine was barely competent the titanium is a wonderful machine not only is the espresso excellent but the panerella wand makes awesome froth and the thing looks great it 's fully programable and once set it 's just a matter of pushing a button to brew a delicious espresso every time ! it warms up in under a minute has a large bean hopper large water resevior very cool blue lcd display i ca n't rave enough i 've had no problems at all with this machine and i recommend it heartily	16

1	i admit it sometimes i just forgot to check to see if the cat wanted back in the driveway patrol fixed all that setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door i originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so i aimed the sensor low across the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine it now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived the driveway patrol actually saved me quite a bit of trouble one day when i had been waiting the entire afternoon for the cable guy he eventually showed up late did n't even bother to knock or ring the bell and only stayed just long enough to leave a note telling me i was n't home due to the drveway patrol i managed to wave him down at the end of the drive this alone made the gadget worth the price as i 've said the driveway patrol does exactly what i need it to do the only false alarms i get are from visiting neighbor cats racoons and the odd bird the only things i would change about the gadget would be to add a volume control that had more settings than 'loud' and 'very loud' and the fact that the chimes will ring continuously while being triggered and then for another 10 15 seconds beyond that	16
1	we had the pleasure of seeing this the other night in san francisco at the castro theater in dual projection 3 d against a silver screen flimsy little glasses were provided to help blend the images poppped out onto the screen by the twin projectors it must have cost a mint just to stage this show but happily the event was packed with like minded creature lovers and everyone cheered ooeh and aahed as soon as the brazilian diggers uncover in a solid block of limestone the skeletonized hand of a long dead creature its webbed fingers beckoning right out over the audience 's heads ! it was a powerful punch to the solar plexus and a reminder that even archaeology has its thrills the 3 d effects are more subtle than you 'd think there 's nothing else for example as in your face as the ping pong ball that jumps repeatedly off the screen in house of wax here director jack arnold seems to be trying really hard to give flesh and blood to his two pprotagonists richard carlson and richard denning showing them off as the brain and the emotions while julie adams plays sensitively and sympathetically to both is she sort of trying to figure out which side of the bread her butter 's on \? the doctor tells her that she repaid any debt she owed richard carlson long ago she does n't owe him anything anymore her playing pygmalion to her untutored galatea so in a way it 's hard to tell upfront which man she 's going to wind up with the creature i found sympathetic in a way but i think the performance must be docked a wee bit because of the different actors playing the part up on top it 's the sensitive tortured ben chapman while down below ricou browning 's frisky balletic style like harold land underwater makes him seem more fancy free to top it off julie adams and ben chapman were there discussing the complex dynamic of the beauty and the beast scenario producer william alland dreamed up on a south american jaunt with orson welles miss adams has got to be in her 70s surely and yet she is still heart stoppingly gorgeous and lovely she spoke to anyone who approached her seemingly grateful to the fans who have kept the creature from the black lagoon and the woman he loved alive in cultural memory for more than fifty years now it was an enchanted evening in dual projection 3 d no less	16

0	first off this machine looks great but unfortunately that 's where the attraction ends you see i too used a little krups 45 espresso machine for years but it was a heck of a lot easier to use and made consistently better espresso cappucinno than this dog here 's a brief synopsis the reservoir holds enough water for just a couple of days i'm constantly refilling it after making an espresso the thing leaks out coffee drippings for minutes on end making a mess of the whole machine the steamer seems to spurt out as much water as it does steam the lever that dispenses the steam does not move in a fluid fashion and positioning the coffee holder pod thingy is downright cumbersome did i mention the thing leaks \? now you might forgive the little bugger if it made amazing capuccino it does n't	16

1	well after all the media attention bully has arrived it would seem that all those nutty parental groups were wrong again may be now they 'll focus on some real problems facing our poor children not only did this game prove not to be a columbine handbook it tries to show a better way to deal with the problems facing teens well the rant is over now for the rave the game mechanics are excellent like many of rockstar titles they 've improved on the gta engine allowing smoother play stepping away from the mission types in the gta series bully had to have better ideas without falling back on the gta typical t a wholesale killing now do n't get me wrong i enjoy the gta series and most of rockstar 's other releases i never passed shop class though seeing the gta open ended engine applied to another series just shows me the various directions they can go in as far as game creation the mini games are fun and addictive i wish they would have other classes represented with bully you get to not only play a great game but some of us old folks will travel back to a simpler time overall this is an excellent game worth your time and a is a fine example of how stupid the media and those parental groups can be	16

1	i really enjoy this game i think they could have done better some of the driving chases just seem a bit silly i enjoy the more tactical work he is required to do however i ran into a glitch and i went online and found there are others who had the same problem where you get totally stuck and cannot move forward at all i played 2 nights in a row thinking i did something wrong before i looked up a walkthrough online and found out it was just a glitch in the game one i followed the instuctions i was finally able to move on so watch out for that it 's right after you go up in a watch tower with a sniper rifle then enter a wharehouse to protect madsen which as soon as you enter there should be a lot of men coming in my problem was only 1 guy or other people say no men at all if that happens then you hit the glitch because a lot of men should come rushing in the instructions i followed are as follows turn on your ps2 is turned off with game and memory card in then load the game \( it should be at 4 28 if its not see note below \) when the cut scene with jack and tony begins remove the memory card and the warning memory card removed use save game option to manually save progress re enable autosave \? press x for ok and re insert the memory card then watch the cut scene the previously on 24 dialog box will appear press x then play the game as usual if done correctly many men will enter after you complete the mission make sure you save it note if your memory card is at 4 41 go restart the mission and do a save during the cut scene you will overwrite 4 41 and be back at 4 28 it helped me and if it happens to you believe me you will be glad you read this because i sure was	16

0	for those of you looking for more eva action after seeing the original series take heed don't buy this dvd ! the death part of the dvd part 1 is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season and the second half rebirth part 2 is new stuff very good but ! if you buy 'the end of evangelion' you get rebirth and a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material so do n't buy 'death rebirth' buy 'the end of evangelion' instead	16

1	in 1997 forty years after julie andrews performed the title role live in rodgers and hammerstein 's tv production of cinderella r b singer brandy brought the role to life in tv 's third incarnation of this musical classic produced by the wonderful world of disney and whitney houston who played the fairy godmother ratings were huge for the program and it even won an emmy this new production is different from the previous two in several ways for one this one is a made for tv movie whereas the previous two were shot as if they were televising a play this new version also has three new songs the sweetest sounds written by richard rodgers the music 's in you and falling in love with love written by richard rodgers and lorenz hart updated special effects more modern vernacular a more empowered cinderella and a color blind casting approach lend a freshness to the classic fairy tale and i'm not too thrilled with all the complaints about the mixed cast i for one am thrilled that little girls and little boys can watch this and see themselves represented no matter what race they are it 's nice that for once a little african american girl can see herself as the object of desire and yes the black queen and white king have an asian son families like that are not uncommon today funny that people do n't have a problem with a pumpkin becoming a carriage or mice becoming horses but they have a problem with this a few flaws exist in the film the cgi effects are sometimes a little too obvious such as in the pumpkin transformation sequence and although brandy is sweet and lovely as cinderella she 's no julie andrews these flaws do not detract from the general charm of this production and do n't put me off at all i love brandy 's performance and her more modern feminist approach to the character of cinderella however disney needs to release a new dvd version this dvd is one of the first disney dvds ever in fact this dvd predates the disney dvd brand and logo the bonus features include a home video release trailer and a cinderella story featurette i think it 's time to update this dvd release the transfer is very good but could possibly use a bit of remastering maybe some retrospective bonus materials and since an official soundtrack was never released a music only track would also be a nice idea maybe some audio commentary from the actors and producers and such despite all the flaws of this dvd treatment and the flaws of the production itself it 's definitely a dvd i was thrilled to find for 10 at a local drug store because i 've loved this production ever since it first aired in november of 1997 on abc it 's definitely worth buying	16
1	i have to admit that at first listening i found some aspects of ms belle 's interpretations of these pieces disorienting however as i listened to these covers repeatedly i can now say that i understand better what the vocalist is after not that i always agree with her and with george duke the arranger producer but i agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened ms belle has immense talent superb technique and a clear idea of each piece and she delivers the goods without faltering or compromise i admire that a lot in a performer her choices ask us for a reaction and we are free to accept or reject what she has offered us when i first heard these renditions i was quite stand offish but over time i have come to appreciate them more and more almost to the point of addiction and am grateful to regina and george for their strength of conviction as well as their superior musicianship they do not want us to listen in a passive way they are waiting for our reaction and god this is really so so good that 's the true spirit in which an album should be recorded i 'd encourage you to get this album because it is about strong powerful and personal interpretations of some great jazz standards by regina you may love everything about it or you may reject aspects of her interpretations but in any case you will not remain indifferent you will be enriched by hearing these pieces in a clear and beautifully personal way that is an important aspect of why i love this imaginative innovative quality music and why this recording is invaluable and it cannot be said enough that her backing band is incredible giving this album the necessary push to take it over the edge it is a success because it skilfully avoids being categorized regina has had the courage to break out of the traditional mould and make a successful cross over which some purists may not approve of only time will tell	16

1	having recieved both dogfancy and dogworld i prefer dogworld i have found that dogfancy tends to focus more on purebreds and akc events than on the general everyday mutts of america and what the owner of one can do with them as an owner of a shelter mutt i appreciate dogworld 's emphasis on the world of dogs their nutrition health care exercise and varied news paragraphs i especially like the column on agility training it is as beneficial to agility persons as well as great advice for any other sport flyball obedience herding hunting trials etc since all sports deal with pretty much the same mental and physical aspects i also really enjoy the different sports they highlight in each issue the only thing about dogworld that bothers me is its series articles if you do n't follow one series to completion you get confused and sometimes the series are more geared to the professional world \( veternarians and trainers \) than to the 'regular' folk dogworld gives a much more rounded view of the world of dogs and what can be done with them than dogfancy which tends to focus on more of the breeding side of the world and akc	16
0	this is fun and a good idea but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor it fell apart the first time we had it up and while you can put it back together unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds it is n't worth it the keyboard itself is fine the microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it but the keyboard does the microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away i would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead or if you buy this product do n't expect to use the keyboard stand for long but it can work without it	16
1	i think i'm a little crazy for buying this i just had to find out if the copper core was really better than an aluminum one it is but not by that much you can buy a pan from cuisinart 's multiclad series that will do the same thing almost as well for a much cheaper price that being said this thing is very well designed the rolled lip is useful for pouring the radius of curvature where the bottom meets the sides is large enough to allow for utensils to easily get in there \( a problem with most pans \) the handle stays cool and is well designed overall this is the best 2 quart saute pan money can buy is it worth it \? that 's up to you	16

0	i bought the camera in may of 2006 as a graduation gift for my son he loved the style and compactness he experienced focus zoom problems after 1 use unfortunately he did n't start to use the gift for 2 months or i might have been able to return to amazon for a refund contacting fufifilm has been overly cumbersome their website is not straightforware and their voice response system is not user friendly or responsive \( long waits \) they have had the toy camera \( as this is being written \) for over a week and when i called yesterday for status they told me that the camera has n't been diagnosed yet i expect it will be once their 90 day warranty expires which will limit fujifilm 's liability to the 1 repair i have a mean case of buyer 's remorse i might as well have taken the 235 00 spent on this camera and tossed it in the street if you own one and it does n't require repairs you might like it if it ever requires repairs you might feel as i that you would have been better to purchase a disposable digital camera save yourself the potential aggravation and look to a camera that has a longer warranty a better support environment or by all means purchase the extended warranty you may still face the frustrations but will have the consolation of knowing that it will cost you no more then shipping to have it repaired i bought it in may of 2006 i feel like i lost it in july of 2006 if i could have given the z1 less then 1 star i would have that's what it deserves ! ! 444en fujifil	16

0	i use adobe acrobat professional extensively both as an attorney and as a researcher author because of the new features advertised which would enhance acrobat storage of powerpoint presentations i bought it off the shelves at a local staples office supply dealer i am proficient at my own installations and expected no trouble on this it acted like a virus the program did not finish installing worse yet it corrupted the underlying 7 0 installation and fixed that so the windows controller program could not install it i had to hack through the registry to remove traces of it finally i got to a stage where it appeared to be going through the registry process again then i received the coup de grace a bad serial number message i checked carefully and it matched the serial number exactly as on the label sent by adobe inside its factory package i used microsoft onenote to make a colored screen copy of this phenonema and marched the package back to staples where they refunded my money it 's too bad about the 20 plus billable hours as a lawyer lost to this process my experiences in calling adobe in the past when i puzzled through a far lesser discourage me from wanting to talk to their technical support people \( who too often know less than me given the increasingly apparent out sourcing to people who read from a script and give us credit for knowing far less than we do \) at any rate i am now bitter my 7 08 installation of adobe worked great on my favorite computer where i had the bulk of my multimedia presentations which i hoped to reduce complete with sounds to the adobe 8 0 format i suspect that wrong serial numbers were slapped on the packages i am deeply disappointed even angry at the inconvenience this has caused me i took it home and tried it on my desktop there and it also would not complete the installation and ruined my chances of a clean uninstallation of 7 0 deactivation of 7 0 could not take place either after installation of 8 0 i do n't know what adobe was thinking or if they were thinking i have been a loyal customer of theirs for many years but i'm thinking distinctly non charitable thoughts about them this early morning i hope they get their act together soon they owe us all a quick fix and patch and they need deep repentance for the damage this did to windows xp home installations which also appear to be corrupted in the process of installing this upgrade program which acts more like a computer worm or virus than a program	16
0	ella enchanted has been my favorite book for years and when i heard that they were going to make it into a movie i was estatic i marked the movie release date on my calander got my tickets in advance and waited on pins and needles on the way to the theater the movie was a huge dissapointment while i was n't expecting the movie to be just like the book i certainly was n't expecting that while the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie i hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book the only common thread i found were the names of the characters and the fact that ella was cursed from birth i suggest that you go and read the book if you enjoyed the movie it is far better with an increadible story line and an ending that still brings me to tears despite the fact that i 've read it over 100 times	16

0	shoppers beware the item itself is a great item but i have received the worst shipment ever from my online orders 1 even though the item is advertised in amazon as new i received an item which was previously used and apparently for a long long time the rocker seat was dirty and smelled 2 even though the seller charges more than 9 dollars for shipping they did not bother to put the manufacturer fragile box in a mailing box therefore the package arrived cut in several locations with some of the items bulging out 3 some of the accessories are missing and i can bet the previous owner forgot to return them	16
1	i purchased this from amazon having only seen it in photographs based on the online images i expected the top to be opaque pink and the bottom part to be see thru pink so i could see what was inside when it arrived the top was indeed the exact color as on amazon but the bottom was a pearlized lighter opaque pink i do n't have any problem with this in fact i may even like it better but it was just unexpected overall the case is great just as advertised it will hold 15 dolls in a standing position with plenty of space in the 2 compartments in the lid for all sorts of shoes and accessories the doors on top are difficult to open and i know i will have to help my 4 year old with it at first until they soften up a bit but at least they wo n't be flying open spewing mini plastic platform shoes everywhere as one previous reviewer noted there is a larger open space in the main compartment that is n't great for holding a lot i plan on using either a ziploc bag in that space to maximize it or attaching a \( pink ! \? ! \) piece of cardboard or thin plastic to extend the height of it we 'll then be able to fit massive amounts of clothes in there ! my cart does say barbie on the lid but the markings are discrete and tastefully done overall i like this cart it 's probably the best storage device for barbie that i 've seen it 's cute fairly well made and will hold a ton i did n't give it 5 stars because of the issue with the interior storage the handle seems a bit flimsy the wheels are not great for carpet and it 's a bit pricey	16

1	okay first of all this game is a very violent game and i would not recommend parents to buy it for children under 13 you must also make sure that they know the violence and crime is fake there will be serious consequences for doing these things in real life and they know not to do what they do in this game back to the game this is simply hands down the best game ever created it is an innovation within an innovaton the storyline is excellent as you get betrayed and shot by your friend during a bank robbery later you must work your way through the dark streets of liberty city working your way toward the ones who betrayed you the missions never repeat themselves and they are always fun and challenging but you will not be able to beat this game without codes and i do not know anyone who did so i strongly advise you get the codes before playing other than that the sense of freedom this game gives you in between and after all of the missions is astounding you can go almost anywhere and do almost anything something never before acheived in a video game gameplay 5 extremely fun and addictive especially when you have a group of your friends around you to see your crazy runs from the law and laugh as you drive your car off a cliff into the ocean \( nothing beats the feeling when you watch your friend do the same thing \) sound 5 the radio stations are great especially game fm the commercials are extremely hilarious and you can even make your own custom radio station with your own tunes graphics 4 allright but could be better storyline 5 great story very fun missions i really have to congratulate rockstar with their acheivment in the video game industry great job guys as for the people reading this if this game is on its way to your house right now click the buy button above bottom line wow	16
0	i had high hopes on this game but i was disapointed the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad the story line was basically typical it really did n't hold my interest for long i did beat the game because i spent 50 on it the day it came out and i figured i would at least do that i gave the game to a friend of mine after i beat it and he had the same opinion as i did it 's worth renting but definately not worth buying hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	16

1	this film came out in 1973 and i saw it in its original full length version \( about 3hours and 15 min \) executives from columbia pictures were there it was the premeire and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out \( verbal \) and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums the executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across columbus circle in boston and i and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free we returned to the film and i have always loved this crazy redition of lost horizon the miscasting the terrible sets the odd ball music for the story the dubbed liv ullmann the dance routines of olivia hussey all of it you cannot find a musical like it or a soundtrack like it columbia execs were unimaginative they should have believed in this film the next day after this premeire in boston new york etc \( simultaneous i suppose \) the film was cut the posters were taken down there was a ton of material to buy t shirts dolls posters of all sizes bath towels with the poster on them records of the sd tk of course and small pop up sets of the entire film it was to be a massive hit in two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed and the posters said last two weeks and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared but many people came to see it lines of people and when they heard it had been cut they gave up and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film i have many treasures from that opening nite and now i have the cd of the sound track anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film it is unique enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a dvd they are out there	16
1	like the photo implies and like most 2 \( x \) ist men 's products this underwear is sexy comfortable flattering and made of quality materials believe me this trunk truly has a pouch a big one its actually just the right size for me and i am sure you will have no problem fitting in it filling it the lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas so its really nice of course the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this no show i had no problem with this being no show wearing my lowest rising jeans with it basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants \) for me this trunk was not uncomfortable given its diminished size and intent to be no show granted in those moments of excitement things do get a little more eh crowded but a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear i did not experience much more discomfort than i did in any other brief boxerbrief trunk this pair is made of 100 cotton so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the x factor line may enjoy this feature my only complaint is that the leg openings do not cling to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon etc but that is just minor the waistband is as always a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height in keeping with the no show design may i suggest you go for the extra bold 2 \( x \) ist no show trunk 3133c which comes in contrasting colors same product same price just sexier ! i cannot reccommend this trunk enough and within hours it became my favorite 2 \( x \) ist product in my collection	16

1	okay i have n't used this while reading in bed yet but as a supplemental light for uses in areas of minimal lighting it 's great ! the light is n't good for areas that are adequately well lit so do n't bother to use the light there but in areas where light is dim the light shines literally it casts a bright light on the page \( s \) that you need to view it 's helped me tremendously get through pages of reading yes it 's a bit pricey for what you get but it 's incredibly compact as it fits nicely in my bag imagine carrying a lamp everywhere you go the power adapter however is a cumbersome brick as for the limited time in which the light bulb is useful for i ca n't offer an estimate of time yet but so far my bulb has been running for at least 15 hours or so cumulative not consecutive hours so no complaints yet about that whenever i saw this light online or in the store i used to think why in the world would i ever want something like this \? now my thoughts are why did n't i ever think to buy this before \?	16

1	i like this rotisserie 's quality ease of use and functionality the rotisserie fits my weber performer grill \( which i also like a lot \) perfectly which is no surprise since it 's made specifically for weber 's 22 1 2 inch kettle grill the spit has a nice chrome finish as do the forks and appears that it will last this is my first rotisserie unit and perhaps this might be common knowledge but after using it a few times i found that using the balancing weight works best by first putting your bird or roast on the spit then inserting the loaded spit in the ring without the weight tightened down or inserted in the motor so that the spit may find its own balance which naturally will have its heavy side down next i tighten the weight opposite of this heavy side insert it in the motor turn it on i then play with the positioning of the weight relative to the spit but remaining opposite of the heavy side so that it spins with the least amount of strain to the motor \( hope that was n't too wordy \) anyway i 've cooked chickens a roast and a 12 pound turkey \( hoping to cook a big honkin' turkey soon \) all with great success in conjunction with the rotisserie i 've finally discovered the canjun injector the hypodermic needle like flavor injector using both brings out juicy and flavorful foods one other tip carfully open and keep the box that the rotisserie came in for storage i put some self stick velcro on the box ends and it keeps this otherwise awkward to store gizmo safe and stack able i plan to buy another rotisserie unit for my weber gas grill i do n't know why but in addition to the more succulent outcome of the food seeing your food spin around the fire adds to the anticipation of the meal	16

0	i bought this epilator solely for upper lip hair it takes off most of it but i dont think it epilates coz u can still see minute hair which wont be caught up in the blades and also the hair regrow in 2 3 days much like shaving it off i would rather goto the salon every 2 weeks than use this every 3rd day moreover on underarms it pains as much as the other epilators so if you already have one dont waste your money on this one	16

1	i 've used version 2003 and enjoyed it thoroughly i primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each what was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes it also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature the tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze when working with paper this was not always an easy task to take on several weeks ago i downloaded the trial version of onenote 2007 the improvements are rather subtle but powerful it did n't take anything to get comfortable with the new features after a short time with the trial version i just purchased it because it was so much fun here are some of the beneficial features like a paper notebook you have sections but with onenote 2007 you can have as many sections as you like you can easily link pages to outlook i have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings it makes being organized for a meeting a breeze also it 's a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish you can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails well worth your time it is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet pc like i do i love it for that use there is a fantastic text recognition feature that works extremely well if you use a tablet this is a great feature as was with the earlier version you can add voice content to your notes that 's right voice recorded messages can be added to your notes too cool before you buy you might want to go to the microsoft site and download the trial version you 'll be able to assess for yourself i think you 'll be pleased i fond it to be one of the best products for 'electronic file keeping' that i 've used for the price it 's not a bad deal	16

1	i 've owned this smoker for 6 years and have had great success turning out turkeys pulled pork ribs etc couple of tips that took me some time to work out 1 \) cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it this 'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly you wo n't have to refill it during the smoking and it 'll prevent the smoker from getting too wet inside when i left it uncovered i was getting steamed meat not smoked 2 \) drill a hole in the bottom of the unit and get a drip pan underneath it this 'll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust 3 \) get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element makes cleanup much easier and gets the heat reflected up to the food have fun	16

1	an excellent project for your child 's school report we purchased the velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect after opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit we experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones ! we buried these edible bones in ground up oreo cookies what a thrill to see our daughter 's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils ! we ca n't wait to purchase other kits in the eyewitness series	16
1	this is a very nice affordable watch i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will always be accurate people who own 1000 watches ask me about it a lot when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night and that i only paid 60 for it while on sale from amazon they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches	16
0	bought this machine based on the reviews on amazon it was okay at first i workout regularly with tapes outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week by the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain we tried to see if we can fix it but it did n't work i ca n't use it anymore mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere you get what you paid for ! ! ! now i'm looking to invest in something more sturdy if you exercise once every month this is the machine for you !	16
0	i had heard of the importance and significance of the education of henry adams for a long time i finally determined i needed to read it i acutally read it twice and found less in it the second time than the first i am sorry i missed the greatness of this book i am sure there was something wrong with me but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there granted he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second rate occupants of the white house but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please a blue blooded snob like adams depresses me why did anyone bother \? he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery sharp tongues clever remarks and brilliant conversation the world went on without him truth be told and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day he was a very good historian in his time but who reads his books now \? not very many in short his own work was not as long lasting as he would have wanted it to be maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams the education of henry adams does not have much real information he got education in one place none in others surely the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry but he wrote nothing about it in his book when eric sevareid wrote not so wild a dream it was compared to the education of henry adams that was meant as a compliment oddly i think sevareid 's book is much much better sevareid wrote of america the common man the war and what it all meant to him adams needed to get out more he did not see america not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together and defended it i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams again a lot of this might be me perhaps i read the book at a bad time maybe i needed to read it a third time i do not know i do know i do not think this is a great american classic forgive please my ignorance	16
0	i recently purchased two of these sheets and ended up taking them right back they say they 're fitted but they are n't elastic so they 're not that well fitted they are paper thin apparently graco has n't put these on their pack n plays and observed the quality ! i purchased the koala portable sheets which were cheaper thicker and truly are fitted with elastic ! do n't waste your money on these	16
0	good lord but this was awful normally a amp e makes a mean costume drama but benedict arnold stank like rotting poultry the dialogue was stilted and incredibly unrealistic the battle scenes were rendered in clunky slo mo to cover up the lack of extras and the costumes appeared to have been rented from a cheap halloween shop \( with the exception of the military uniforms especially the continentals' which were accurate \) aidan quinn chewed the scenery into pulp and used quot historical voice quot \( the lame semi british accent affected by actors in costume drama \) kelsey grammer was pretty darn good as washington but his lines were horrid horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade school history text worst of all were the simpering john andre and peggy arnold whose rose garden courtship scene was laughably bad in short do n't even bother to rent this it 's an hour and a half of your life that would be better spent cleaning the house or napping	16

0	for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the next riverdance the dancers are all talented if self consciously hip and in great shape but the numbers that focus more on t a than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me i love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms but ballroom dance is ott enough \( if you 've ever watched a competition \) and does n't need to be tarted up beyond recognition the way it is here add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess	16

1	i bought this bike for my boyfriend for christmas it arrived in about 3 days rather than the expected 5 7 we set it up on about half an hour it comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up i read an other review \( prehaps on a different bike \) that you need a cresent wrench however for this bike you do n't he uses it every night and i use it a few times a week it 's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet granted i 've only had it for a month i would definitely recommend this product	16

0	when you buy natori you expect the best but this product just is n't up to their usual high standard most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings for 20 dollars they should be awesome they are n't my favorite panty right now is a nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks i have n't seen them online but this is worth a trip to the store	16
0	polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non metallic surfaces like glass or water they can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image i use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some pop out of clouds there are so many options to consider when purchasing the polarizing filter for your needs for instance linear vs circular film or digital versions or quality vs price if you are making use of a ttl or auto focusing system circular polarizers are designed to work with those features linear polarizers has their uses but they are manufactured differently and may not work unless you are certain just get a circular polarizing filter there are some digital circular polarizers on the market i am not sure what makes a cir pl lens better for digital as opposed to film i use a canon 20d digital slr and see no problems caused by using a supposed non digital filter on a digital camera most of the time when it comes to filters you get what you pay for does that mean you need an expensive polarizer \? of course not just be sure to get the right filter for your needs what ever polarizing filter you get make sure it is color neutral to prevent unwanted tinting spending more on a color balanced filter will save time in post if you need multiple filter sizes consider saving money by using step down rings currently i use the hoya pro1 filters as the canon polarizing filters i previously owned were without question bulkier and heavier the weight might not seem like much but when you stick all your items in a backpack all the extra bits of weight add up quickly i can spend a good amount of time with my equipment on my back so this is a big concern for me when it came down to the images at times i would see a browning tint on my photos the tint is easy to clean up in photoshop cs2 but i do n't see that problem with the hoya pro1 filter overall i would recommend against the canon polarizing filters i originally thought it is canon it must be quality since then i have replaced all my canon filters this filter works but comes at a cost of disadvantages to other similarly priced filters pros can be used for film or digital cameraseliminates internal reflections and ghostingcons bulky and heavynot neutral color balance	16

1	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it it 's the best feeling keyboard i 've ever owned the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past highly recommended	16

0	i purchased this rail today for my daughter 's crib that converts into a toddler bed everything on the outside of the box looked great until we got home put it together and put it on the crib there is only about 6 inches of space for my daughter to climb in and out of bed also it sits in about 3 inches which significantly reduces the amount of sleep space after playing with it for awhile i decided to look over the instructions again it states in the warning section that this rail is only for a bed with a box spring and mattress and is not intended for a crib or toddler bed my question is why didn't it say this on the outside of the box \? !	16

0	when you 're gearing up for suicide this whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who 's going to just end it all i found myself suffering nightmares fatigue misery and paranoia my ears unclogged but i started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head this is not a good album for the stressed because it will just make you feel worse i find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable when i first listened to it it sounded inaccessable after listening to it more and more i started to get more into it but i ca n't say i found it a good place to be in it 's a somewhat interesting album but it mostly just dragged me down made me nervous numb and hurt my head people say this is great music let them say what they want give me some old fashioned enjoyable music that does n't make a pest of itself kid a is just ok to me and has n't been worth all the effort to get into this almost seems like a sadomasochistic album to spank the listeners i do n't know maybe i'm missing something but to hear some weird music like this that has miles more heart and is alot kinder to the ears try passengers by u2 and thom york sings like a muppet on this album by the way i 've enjoyed radiohead 's first three albums quite a bit \( including pablo honey why are people always busting its chops \)	16

0	as i stated before i have a fabulous thing called digital cable one night i was flippin through the channels and this movie was on i could only watch so much of it before i had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off sometimes that happens with digital cable but it usually it will right itself in the end as i watched for about a half an hour i could not take it anymore i tried everything to fix it including switching channels turning on and off the tv and things of that nature i even went as far as calling comcast and complaining but even that was a wasted effort i eventually had to turn it off because i was a hairs width away from haymakering morris well even though comcast ruined my viewing experience so far when i was at blockbuster i decided to give it another chance i know i mentioned that the lead actor could not act but i thought i could look past this because it might not be completely his fault for one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices or it might be because it 's his first movie who knows but howard 's mind was made up rumble in the bronx was to be rented from what i saw so far on digital cable i possibly found a person i could call my mentor when i enter the world of stuntmen when i returned home i threw the dvd in the dvd player and guess what \? the dvd was messed up as well the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on digital cable i raced back to blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy telling them this dvd was broken i returned home again and tried to watch it what the heck ! \? i yelled is the world against howard tuttleman ! \? you guessed it that dvd was messed up as too i even tried it out on another dvd player and it proved to me that the run of dvds blockbuster has were all messed up i got so frustrated that i threw the dvd out the window \( i rented it on my father 's card so there is no recourse to me \) after i cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica i was still determined to see this movie i ran up to best buy in troy and i found a copy i asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version hoping that it was a new pressing i was happy with his answer and purchased it well i returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop i put the dvd in the dvd player and dimmed the lights finally tuttleman will have his moment well to keep this clean and short let me say that that night ended with a baseball bat three \( 3 \) stitches in my hand a broken window and a hefty grounding sentence \( we are talking weeks here \) in conclusion some movies ca n't be good no matter how cool the stuntman this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot later	16
1	i have only read the swedish translation of what i suppose is the old edition but judging by look inside this book this new english language edition incorporates much material from the old incidentally the swedish edition gives the authors name as kallistos ware apparently his taken orthodox name while timothy ware is his original given name in sweden the swedish translation of the orthodox church is the only readily available book on the history of the orthodox church apparently its used informally as a textbook in some college classes on church history it also contains chapters on theology and worship in my opinion the book is a necessary introduction for those interested in orthodox church history its first chapters summarize the history of this church during the byzantine empire under islam and in russia both before and during communism of particular interest is the authors interpretation of the catholic orthodox split usually dated to 1054 the author believes that the so called fourth crusade in 1204 was the real and final consummation of this split however the book must also be read with some reservations the author is after all an orthodox christian himself its safe to assume that there is a certain bias here and there for instance ware denies that the byzantine church was caesaropapist a very untenable suggestion at other times he is surprisingly liberal for an orthodox for instance he paints mehmet fatih the muslim conqueror of constantinople as a very tolerant ruler i also wonder about his interpretation of the church father cyprian even so the orthodox church remains an indepensable book for those looking for a short and concise historical over view of this remarkable christian church	16
1	once while traveling i had a big blister on my heel and needed something that would n't rub my heel i happened to get a pair of crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front i was pleasantly surprised by the crocs very cushiony soft like walking on air also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet do n't get sweaty either i originally got the crocs for temporary use but now i look forward to slipping into them everyday when i get home it 's wonderful to feel such cushioning on my feet with every step they 've replaced my slippers mocassins surf shoes and sandals	16
1	although the target audience is stated to be 8 12 year old my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine she has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation not only are the stories lively and entertaining they are educational as well \( i am also learning various things about history and culture that i did not know before ! \) there is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry since receiving this magazine i have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills these reasons are why i believe it is well worth the money and i wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time	16

0	no way to change the inputs on your tv the dvd functions and the tv functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a tv button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on off the tv or the xbox and if things could n't get any dumber if you press the eject button while the remote is in tv mode it does n't work the eject button is only designed to work with the xbox yet it is disabled when in tv mode \? there is also no option to program a receiver as many others mentioned this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage	16
1	barbershop is a rare event in african american filmmaking it 's one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for african americans i love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the african american community is we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen i really liked this movie we definitely need more films like thiscalvin is the owner of a chicago barbershop passed on to him by his late father mired in debt from the shop and his crazy business schemes calvin is desperate to start something of his own and feels that the barbershop is a hindrance on his life it 's not until he sells the barbershop to a loan shark that he realizes the value of the shop to the community and sees a role for himself in the neighborhood there are a dozen other stories that link to this main one and they 're all easy to follow one follows a stolen atm machine one follows the quest for love of an african immigrant another follows a female barber and her cheating boyfriend another follows a guy desperate for a haircut to go to a job interview and yet another follows a white barber 's quest for acceptance by the black barbers he works with in a way this film reminded me of those great ensemble movies like pulp fiction that follow many characters and their stories each of the stories lead up to the ending where calvin saves the barbershop director tim story does a great job of capturing life in chicago and the informal environment of the barbershop i felt the spirit of the windy city and the informal environment of the barbershop watching the conversations in the movie reminded me of the barbershop in harlem my father used to take me to when i was a boy it also reminded me of the charged atmosphere of the old barbershop i used to go to get my flat top trimmed \( both are closed now \) \( there are a ton of great performances in this movie i'm probably going to miss mentioning a few people ice cube is great as calvin i liked his performance here michael ealy stands out in his role as an ex con trying to turn his life around by becoming a barber ealy makes you feel his characters' desperation cedric the entertainer makes a breakthrough performance as an old barber he 's funny and poignant sean nelson is great as an educated man who works as a barber while going to college anthony anderson and larenz tate are hilarious as two bumbling thieves who steal an atm with no money in it watching them try to open will make you laugh keith david is creepy as the loan shark then again keith david is always good in anything he does i 'd pay money to watch him and sam jackson read listings in the yellow pages i do n't know why movie critics and the rev jesse jackson denounced barbershop it 's one of the best movies ever made about african american life looking at the box office of barbershop and diary of a mad black woman african americans actually want more films like this as a black moviegoer i want different black films that allow the world to see the whole community not just one small part of it i for one and tired of the hood movies like never die alone and critically acclaimed movies like monster 's ball and hustle flow that depict black life as something negative \( thankfully it seems the rest of the black community is tired of these types of movies too the box office and dvd sales for them is declining while the box office for movies like barbershop and diary of a mad black woman are going up \) end of rant back to the review a shawn james essential five star video you must buy this movie get some friends together put the dvd in the machine pull up a chair and have a seat in front of the tv and hang out at the barbershop	16
0	yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot \? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast \( from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc \) can turn candy into cuisine	16
1	if you do not yet own dark side of the moon wish you were here and the wall do not even consider purchasing a momentary lapse of reason amlor is junk by comparison that said very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three and amlor certainly has its bright spots learning to fly and on the turning away are as good as anything pink floyd has ever produced some of the other songs are adequate but this album does not contain the front to back brillance of the earlier floyd releases it 's definitely worth having but make sure that you have the others first	16

0	i reviewed the subtle subversiveness of the sinatra version in an earlier issue how does the update stand up \? well once they moved the setting to iraq cleaned up the muddy surrealism sobered up the star and played it straight there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake or chinese cinema we will tell you what to think the locals might mistake it for a documentary i quit watching after 30 minutes you just ca n't carry an entire movie with a fake war hero via hypnosis plot no movie should hinge on a single plot point and if it does please do n't make it a boring one no disrespect to denzel washington intended he played frank sinatra so well that co producer tina sinatra probably got goosebumps and what a waste of meryl streep she did a great job and it did n't matter but hey one of the beauties of watching dvds in china is that i do n't blow three hours' pay on each movie as a brief aside show one flew over the cuckoo's nest to 155 chinese students this film refuses to tell them what to think and that confuses the hell out of them then they ask you mr teacher person to explain the film 's message um it 's about your school but i'm not saying that	16

0	all i wanted was a way to identify some files remember which ones so every time i wanted to backup i would press go and the backup would start alohabob was too smart for my use first it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up i indicate that i want to select my own files \( which it lets me think i can do \) then thinking it would bring me to browser window no no no it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if i had selected the smart find i then manually select my files \( great ! ! \) in trying to save the template of what files i wanted to backup it requires that i make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency \( yuk ! ! \) i want to back up when i get to it \( about once a month not when it wants to i am backing up to a dvd which i need to put in the drive \) ok so now i am over that and the backup begins great ! ! ! upon returning into the application a month later i can not select my saved template to run now it will run when it is scheduled to run \( so i need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up i exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to add the features i described oh well it looked like such a promising product now i need to find another that satisfies my requirements	16

0	i was very very disappointed with the performance of the tribest blender i bought it to blend breakfast smoothies nothing fancy just some protein powder and soy milk i even bought the larger cup the unit is very very under powered did not mix the ingredients had to transfer everything to my larger more industrial blender would not recommend this unit for any serious blending save your money or put it towards a better unit this product is a rip off does not even do the most basic blending of a liquid and a powder	16

0	a terrific idea show the current time and the alarm times all at once very intuitive very helpful unfortunately the backlit lcd display just does n't make the grade the numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable the manufacturer 's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic the numbers just wash out it 's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer 's image and from the unit i got i think that would be a slight improvement because on the one i got the orange \( backlighting the alarm times \) is about twice as bright as the green \( backlighting the current time \) and it just looks weird also fm radio reception is quite poor the line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna but that just does n't work well no matter how i orient the cord i ca n't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away so back it goes	16

1	overall its a fine viewer however it has a couple of problems 1 \) it would be really nice if there was a way to copy pictures off of a sd card and into memory and vice versa this would be invaluable for moving pictures around without having to hook things up to a computer 2 \) hooking it up to a computer is a pain instructions are not helpful if you are using the viewer to look at images off of sd cards in remote places \( ie trailcamera \) it works fine but i 'd like the ability to move pictures off of a card into the viewers internal memory so i can leave the card with the trailcamera 3 this is nasty if you cycle through the pictures too fast you can crash the viewer upon resetting it it will say there are no pictures found on the memory card powering off swapping cards wont help it read the pictures are still there however but you need to then access the card directly through a computer to extract reformat the card and it will be fine with the reader for what i use it for i like it even though it has quirks that must be worked around	16
1	drummer hoff is an unusual story that uses repetitive phrases and rhyming to tell the story of drummer hoff the man who fired it off in this story a group of men are preparing to fire a cannon each man brings something different one man brings the barrel one man brings the carriage and at the every end of each stanza it says but drummer hoff fired it off this story uses childlike drawings to demonstrate the pattern of rhythm in the story the colors are fairly bright which in turn give the story a comical appeal the story itself does n't have any significant moral element to it it is just a fun book the rhyming in this story is very catching and the pictures really make the story very humorous by the end of the story the reader can see that the big explosion has just caused a big mess children will like the flow the story and parents will enjoy reading it aloud a good holiday gift	16
1	this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference but to see the beam \( not just the dot at the end of the beam \) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out and if you are wondering no matter how bright your laser is without particles in the air you wont see the beam at concerts where they use the big argon lasers they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of	16

1	i own the stylus 710 that i have had since september of last year and love it to pieces little did i know olympus was relaseing this little monster onto the market 2 months later it has all of the features and software of the 710 model with digital image stabilization but5x optical 5 6x digital 28x total zoom an upgrade from 15x total zoom \( 3x optical and 5x digital \) the price is about the same and actually an excellent deal here on amazon the 2 5 color lcd monitor with histogram display and auto image rotation has been standard in the 710 and 810 and the 1000 series and i have not problem with it i think it is comparable to all models in this range \( panasonic fuji kodac hp \) i the bright sun no lcd is going to be really great i have captured many fun moments with this camera \( 2 weddings 2 vacations \) and love it the diffence with the 740 model is the thickness is a bit bigger due to the bigger optical lense but that is well worth the sacrifice because having more optical zoom better picture i know i tested this side by side with my 710 pick this up you will not be dissapointed also look at the 750 and the 760 models both of which have optical image and digital image stabilization but alter the zooms a bit compare and see what meets your needs also the olympus mastersoftware is very easy to use and with panoramic feature 3d and extra art features unlocked by olympus brand olympus stamped type h hd this camera becomes even more of a pleasure to own you can edit photos on the computer or right in the palm of your hand both ways this camera will make you feel like a pro in no time	17

0	i got this camera when it was rather new i am not extremely pleased with it it is not acting this way because it is 2 years old it was like this when i bought it first of all it has no lens cover so you have to keep it in a camera bag incase you touch the lens without relizing all your pictures will be ruined it takes for ever to take a picture you have to wait for like 2 seconds for the picture to be taken it eats up batteries like crazy it takes forever to turn on if you have the flash setting on autoflash the camera will still flash in bright sunlight the pictures are extremly blurry when you print at home it has no optical zoom \( but the zoom is really the customer 's choice	17

0	hey kids fire up the xbox and lets watch this movie ! that is what is heard through households that own an xbox but for some reason or another they are still in the 90 's and do n't already have a dvd player like my title suggests if you already have a dvd player this is a waste of money the only reason i purchased one is because my dvd player had problems playing some dvd r 's that i got from a friend i had some money to burn so i just wanted to see if the xbox dvd kit could play it to determine if the dvd was a bad burn or was it just my dvd player i found that the xbox was able to play the dvd r 's in question with no problem however aside from those two dvd r 's all of the dvd 's i own are bought from retail stores so i really have no need to play dvd r 's and my dvd player plays normal discs perfectly with that being said i only used xbox 's dvd playback kit once to watch the dvd r 's i had problems with because of the content of these burned movies there is really no need to watch them again however if push comes to shove i can always use one of my pc 's or mac to watch the burned dvd no need to use my xbox for that i meant to return the dvd kit the next day but never got around to it the xbox 's dvd player is a good feature but the fact that microsoft charges you to use the feature makes it not worth the money unless of course you do n't have a dvd player at all	17

0	the movie had potential good cast and interesting plot its the kind of movie you want to like but just ca n't i did not find it all that funny or romanic it seemed that the mother and a bride 's maid were suppose to be funny characters but i found neither very amusing i have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie their relationship is not developed well at all as another reviewer noticed there is a bit of pretty woman here as dermot plays a male escort for whatever reason julia roberts as a hooker is cute whereas dermot is not i found is pretty disgusting that messing falls for a male prostitute there is a lot of crude sexual humor that i did n't care for my favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the english countryside which is really beautiful its not a terrible movie but i would be upset if i paid 10 to see it in the theater	17
0	downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss i have had many collections i 've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack and items i really liked were suddenly unavailable so i was looking forward to a stuff pack from maxis bah yes there are several very nice items but really this is an underwhelming collection on the whole items are very limited and the collections are small the pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained like so many here remarked the money spent is not equal to the value received another reviewer pointed out what the title glamour life implies jewelry house items luxurious textures for floors and walls and clothing for all ages and most of all excess and abundance there 's no abundance here i 've found items i like but i am not impressed with the collection maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items and i think it is taking advantage of the fact fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money i feel a little cheated if you must have this wait until the price drops or better yet find a good reputable fan site \( there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads \) and download for a small fee or for free	17
0	the idea for this product is great the problem is with its design and or choice of materials regarding the buckles the buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex this caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place they instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage if another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect	17
1	i bought 2 sets of these chairs and the matching table i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived they are quite substantial without being heavy and their appearance is quite nice the chairs came with no assembly and the table was very easy to put together with the provided allen wrench the feet on the chairs are adjustable so that you can get rid of the iritation of off balanced legs overall this was an incredible value at approximately 650 for the set i was so impressed by the quality and price that i have since ordered the matching bench	17

1	this is my third child and third infant car seat this was the most expensive but worth the money the padding keeps the baby 's head from that scary 90 degree flop the shoulder straps have padding which prevents the red marks the others left on my kids the straps do n't get twisted and it 's much easier to get in and out of the car it 's the same weight as the others \( which is to say rather heavy and awkward to carry \) the only thing i do n't like is it does not fit on shopping carts worth the money	17
0	this was my second netgear product i bought \( previously a wireless modem which i was only okay with not impressed \) the idea of a network storage appeals to me but this drive just is not good in reading the previous reviews i found that it was a finicky thing and be careful on the drives you buy for it well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well but that is where everything started to go down hill midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages \( which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors \) and suddenly my computer reboots figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot tried again same thing happens started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 you need to look in to your own computer to quote netgears web site scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives many newer computers use promise sata drivers my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers back in the box the sc101 goes and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests and none work this is where i get really frustrated netgear support i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone who ultimately told me it was my own fault and i 'd have to pay to have that cr p yes he said it from my system i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill i have to pay to get this junk off my computer way to support your products netgear the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand and went through huge mood swings during the call from happy to argumentative to depressed to happy again i was freaked that this person knew my home address ! all in all this is a great concept after reading up on it and now experiencing it i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market maybe by a company with better customer service it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer	17

1	when i first opened up the super quick charger i was a bit put off it 's small it 's cheap looking compared to the old nicd charger i used to have it was very unimpressive then i plugged it in say what you will about this barebones solution it works amazingly well it charges the batteries quickly and the batteries last a really long time in between charges it does exactly what i was looking for if i could improve anything it would be to implement some sort of cover on the battery slots while it 's not essential to the process by any means it would look a lot better and the batteries would be less prone to being jostled out of their positions in mid charge by a curious cat	17

0	sarah brightman is one of my all time favorite artists but this disc is just a complete waste it is missing so much and has too many songs that do n't belong like the phantom songs as much as i love them save them for the andrew llyod webber collections ca n't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from dive \? her classics album had it right except their version of captain nemo was the rip off live version and this cd does n't even have the captain nemo song which is a huge fan favorite and definitly was a single it is also missing how can heaven love me eden harem and beautiful all singles as well save your money either buy the classics album for a somewhat better compilation or just make your own mix like i did because sarah has so many wonderful songs \( and quite a few bad ones i will admit \) and it seems on here they give you some bad ones \( like requium and nella fantasia \) and leave out the good ones it 's a beautiful day and what you never know are good but are the weakest songs form harem why on earth would you leave out harem and beautiful but leave on beautiful day and wynk \? whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in i bet sarah did n't have much say in this compilation this is just a waste beautiful album cover though	17

0	if i could give half a star i would i had this unit for exactly 93 days and it just wouldnt turn on one day i used it less than 3 times a week there are several drawbacks to this unit it draws alot of electricity to run it i could use the same socket to run anything else while this on water gurgles spits out of the spout while its boiling and i have gotten burned the spout is also poorly designed the water does n't come out in an even stream it goes where it chooses and even out of the seam of the lid the heating element is exposed inside the pot and makes it almost impossible to properly clean the water does get really hot in a short amount of time but its not worth it i just bought the braun wk200b about a week ago it is everything this kettle is n't and so much more read the reviews on that one before you buy this one its a better choice all around save the shipping costs time headache just buy the braun first and pass this one up	17
0	ve2 has a ton of potential but it just does n't work out brandy davis is both cute and sexy of course but playboy 's testing the limits is a much better showcase for her um talents not to be mean but most of the film 's other women just are n't that attractive and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack contrary to a previous reviewer the massage scene is fairly ordinary the girl girl stripper scene is the most disappointing however it starts really well with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action the only scene worth watching at all is blue collar vignette with two girls and one guy hooking up stay away from this one	17

0	this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework writing a book is no small feat and technical books are a special beast with that last statement in mind this is were the book sadly falls short for one the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books' code the authors explain \( on the publisher site \) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print while improvement is always good this presents two problems 1 the sample application is now out of sync with the material not a good thing for those trying to learn as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book also and this is not to disparage the authors skill but i buy books because i am expecting experienced if not expert advice if a small sample application needs rewriting perhaps they should write about something else \? further down this road the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling i suspect that the final build file was not tested or it was a case of well it compiles on my machine there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled thankfully i use eclipse and imported the project eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive examples are jakarta commons collections and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access for an experienced developer familiar with ant and a good ide it was not a lot of trouble to get it running it just did not give me a good impression bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql first no matter what db you swap in you 'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file i made property variables which i placed in build properties then you will need to change the class user to something else \( and of course anything in the app that references it \) another great reason to use eclipse why you must change it is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you ca n't name a table user	17

1	i can not put into words what this journal of the truth has done for me as a african american male living in the united states of america i was introduced to this book by a man of guyanese decent who knew i needed to read this book i have to admit it was a difficult read because my primary education only spoke of american history and there was no mentioning of any african caribbean contributors from the middle passage period now at thirty nine many things are clearer to me roots and beloved are historic well documented treasures and need to be used in educating all children no matter race creed or color to make sure what i read had some semblance of truth while in puerto rico i visited a sugar mill in guanica and my heart just melted if you read the book you will understand my feelings i became angry because something as simple as not being forthwith with documented history such as this to young minds of american children lead to misunderstandings amongst the masses hailing from africa south america the caribbean asia united states and europe eric williams i know i can not thank you in person because you are no longer here physically but your spirit lives on in your books and you will always be alive everytime one more person reads your book and awaken thank you ! for everyone else read the book it will cleanse your soul and feed your mind once you finish this read how europe underdeveloped africa by the same author	17
1	if you 're a professional photographer you can probably ignore this review but then you probably wo n't be thinking about buying this lens anyway as you 'll be off to purchase a nice l series however if like me you just happen to have a nice canon digital rebel camera \( or equivalent \) and enjoy taking decent pictures this lens will probably work out very well for you i 've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks and it has performed very much as expected for the price it 's perfect for a go everywhere lens a few main points okay it 's not the best image quality even on low medium iso it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive canon lenses it struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit but for well lit outdoor shoots it 's works very well of course it would be nice to have a nice l series with is but if you ca n't afford that then this is a very good value lens not for the real professionals but great if you do n't take things too seriously and just want a bit more zoom and let 's face it who does n't want a but more zoom	17

0	amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization the corporation look moral only someone like al capone could sympathize with this group on the oregon how can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the oregon the us apparently is willing to finance the group but the us also financed sadam noriega unfortunately in this sense it is too much like real american policy which absolutely disgusts me \( the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind as long as they are not righteous americans \) the characters are clich there is no suspense since everything goes as planned and anyone in the crew can just about do anything including being a successful rock band it makes me look back on the dirk pitt books and wonder about dirk 's morality	17

0	i have used the avent isis pump for all three of my children and thought this product would be just as good and liked the fact that it works with the pump i was wrong problems encountered include it is very difficult to screw the caps on tight they tend to leak expensive instructions recommend only using about 4 times and then discarding measurements are hard to read they do not hold a full 8 ozs due to the shape narrow on the bottom and wide on the top they tend to tip over easily and the adaptor for the pump is incovenient as i forgot to pack it more than once ! save your money use bags or pump into the bottles directly if you are not freezing	17

1	although this is a good batch of accessories the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times it has no carry strap the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top so if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture you must open the case pull the camera 's strap through the slit then lift the camera out it would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy	17
0	i found this product after seeing it lauded on the today show and it appeared to be a great idea however i had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the brababy and they were pretty tangled when i later took the bras out i also have to wonder how a larger bra would work considering i'm merely a b cup and it was a tight fit in theory i think it 's an excellent idea in truth i think it still needs work additionally although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times i 've used them even drying on gentle cycle it did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle a plus i hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue	17

0	without any sulfites preservatives hydrogenated oils artificial colors or flavors but not without a great deal of sugar and high fructose corn sweetener like the previous reviewer i bought these at costco brought them back due to the sickly sweet taste there was so much added sugar it was getting a little difficult to taste the berries if you prefer berries au naturel or with just a little extra sweetness watch the ingredient list on these sugar is the second ingredient by weight and corn syrup is the fourth	17
0	hello all lens hoods are pretty much a necessity but this has to be the mostly poorly made hood i 've ever used unlike other hoods that screw on this one requires you to press to opposing clips and then slide the hood one and release the clips this leads to problems of alignment meaning both sides of the clip need to be perfectly aligned in order for the hood to fit right although it 's a pain and i hate i do n't really have another alternative either go w o a hood or take this one either way guess i 'd rather have a hood on the lense than not having one	17

1	turf gear is initally marketed for use with football players well i think the year bill clinton became president was the last time i donned shoulder pads but it did n't stop me from being active later in life with long sleeve turf gear shirts from under armour i was hoping that the product would live up to the description a long sleeve shirt that is skin tight yet allows your skin to breath \? material that wicks sweat away from the skin \? sounded almost too good to be true but i took a chance anyways so far i 've used mine both hiking and cycling with the latter getting so much use that i need to order more despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on it stretches and breathes amazingly well i was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used amazon 's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the under armour product \( fogdog \) and ended up just fine works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what i use mine for bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well and is very comfortable i must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling these shirts are amazingly durable ! i feel the price is definitely worth it excuse me while i go order more	17

1	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	17
1	a little caveat this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1'x1' size tiles \( which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space \) that said these floor mats are really great ! i wanted to create a home gym space for doing floor aerobics step workouts as well as pilates yoga weighted workouts etc these fit the bill absolutely perfectly ! ! ! they are stiff enough that there 's no danger of ankle instability because of a too soft surface but they are soft enough that when you do floor work they provide excellent cushioning my knees used to kill me when i would do a runner 's stretch but now i actually go ahhhh as i'm doing them which is great not even a smidge of discomfort they are also really great for absorbing the jarring of high impact activities talk about an ankle knee and hip saver ! the only discomfort i still notice and i really think it 's just me \) is during floorwork when i'm on my side to do leg lifts i have some problems in the area of the greater trochanter \( bony prominence at the top of the femur \) but i am very sensitive in that area due to running a marathon recently so again i really think it 's just me anyway i just ca n't say enough good things about these mats i highly recommend them now to address the title of my review my only complaint about the mats and i'm echoing another recent reviewer on this is that when i first put them down they slid all over the place on my hardwood floors because they are not completely wall to wall in the configuration i had them this was a problem i was able to solve the problem completely though by buying one of those sticky under carpet anti slip pads that you can get very inexpensively i found a yoga sticky mat placed underneath did the trick as well but i would have had to put about 3 yoga sticky mats underneath to cover enough surface area to keep it from slipping in short if you have hardwood floors like me \( i do n't know how they would perform on carpet or other surface you 'd have to see another review to check on that \) i highly recommend these mats without reservation provided you are willing to shell out a tiny bit of extra dough to get an anti slip pad to put underneath also if you do be sure to get one that covers the whole area of the mat \( or very close to it \) otherwise if you come down on a part that 's not protected during a lateral move you may find yourself sliding across the room and losing your balance a little expensive but really worth the investment in my opinion happy sweating to you \( or whatever activities you plan to use the mats for \)	17
0	this battery only gives me about an hour of playing time on my philips pet724 7 portable dvd divx player after that it claims to have 75 charge left but ca n't even get the player to turn on and does n't charge it if it 's turned off	17
0	i'm more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage buying this for kids and all that its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting at least to me but hopefully it is to kids however they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult clue and not in a good way the room variable for example drops out its not relevant its who ait the cake at what time with what drink it just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant the idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler well the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place and the change sort of makes it more complex in a way you need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens now the sheet does list the rooms you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens but since the rooms are not otherwise relevant its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens the game is also incredibly cheaply constructed for example the die does not have numbers on it you have to put number stickers on it and the board is n't flimsy flimsy would be an improvement anyway not recommended	17
0	as others have said this was a much anticipated game i played caesar ii and iii and was extremely excited when i heard that iv was coming out what a letdown ! i did n't have any of the installation errors that others have mentioned and i have n't had the game crash on me however the game is unplayable on my system which is only a year old unless i turn down 90 of the advanced graphics by unplayable i mean ten seconds or more of waiting between the time you click with your mouse and when the game responds even with the graphics turned down i still get lag when the auto save starts as mouse control is essential when building roads or aquaducts this is aggravating in the extreme it appears that sierra 's programmers and designers put a lot of work into upgrading the graphics too bad i ca n't see them ! the interface is horrible and takes up the right half of the screen at 1280x1024 resolution this means that you must rotate the map to build along the right edge i much prefer the tabbed building interface of the other city building games although you can build roads along the diagonals in this game which you could n't in earlier versions the interface is not smart enough to auto rotate the buildings to fit along the roads you have to click and drag to rotate buildings and lag even at the low graphics settings can make this an exercise in frustration i dislike the new warehouse management panel the sliders might look cool but they 're slow \( lag ! \) i would 've liked to see additional options for only store basic goods only store luxury goods etc this would take some of the pain out of managing them trade ports are different also you ca n't see prices ! it appears that some of the scenarios have hidden milestones that you have to meet in order to advance in the one i'm playing right now i'm stuck because my prosperity rating will not rise above 36 \( 50 required to win \) i have over 30 000 denarii in my treasury and have been turning a hefty profit \( and meeting various demands from rome \) for at least eight years of game time i have met and exceeded all other requirements for victory but prosperity continues to elude me my city is almost completely automated by now the only thing i do is respond to rome 's requests for goods or cash my advisors have nothing helpful to say it 's not fun if i ca n't advance so while the game is pretty from what i can see of it it 's got too many frustrations to be worth much more of my time	17

1	the optical x6 zoom on the canon a710 is is already better than cameras in it s range \( i e non slr \) however the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size the tele converter lens really does make a difference firstly if there are any negatives they are very minor the lens and adapter are black would have been nice to have been silver to match with the camera erm that 's it ! the main quality of canon is the lens which they always do well the clarity of this lens is very good with very little fuzziness at the edge it also connects simply the adapter and seems fairly solid when connected the electronics features help in the overall control of adding the attachment the tele lens does make a difference for just getting that bit closer to get what you want	17

1	if you are a fan of horror movies the old ec comic books stephen king or just fun movies in general than look no further than this 1982 classic ! the movie \( 5 5 \) creepshow is an anthology of scary stories five of them that is bridged together by a sixth tale of a boy who loves horror comics and his abusive dad who hates them the movie features pitch perfect performances by an all star 80 's cast that seems to be having a lot of fun being in this scream of a movie the stories are as follow 1 father's day \( 4 5 5 \) stars carrie nye ed harris and viveca lindfors easily the cheesiest of the five stories \( but still a lot of fun \) father 's day tells the tale of a family reunion from hell when a long dead dad rises from the grave for his caaaaaaakkeeeee \( and for a little good old fashioned zombie revenge \) 2 the lonesome death of jordy verrill \( 4 5 \) stars stephen king although its easily the weakest of the stories it 's probably also the most original so keep your finger off the fast forward button stephen king \( ! \) gives a nutty and throughly enjoyable performance as a country bumpkin who battles alien plantlife from a meteroite that touches down in his backyard sounds weird \? you do n't know the half of it 3 something to tide you over \( 5 5 \) stars leslie nielsen ted danson and gaylen ross this segment is legendary leslie nielsen gives the performance of his life as a psychotically jealous husband who takes a notion to bury his wife and her lover neck deep in sand before the tide rolls in needless to say love is more powerful than death as our antihero soon finds himself neck deep in terrifying troubles of his own 4 the crate \( 5 5 \) stars hal holbrook adrienne barbeau and fritz weaver hands down the best tale of terror it 's no wonder that the three main actors of this single story also receive top billing in the picture 's opening credits this epic blood soaked tale of insanity fear and fidelity is a timeless classic with excellent performances all around and an unforgettable monkey like demon from special effects master tom savini the longest segment of the film the crate tells the story of henry \( holbrook \) a college professor with an unbelievably obnoxious and domineering wife \( a brilliant performance by barbeau \) when henry 's colleague dexter stanley \( weaver \) discovers a flesh eating monster under the stairway under the stairs of the college and informs henry the henpecked husband makes plans to use the monster to his own domestic advantage this out of this world premise carries very real themes of love and death friends and family and moral responsibility versus personal hapiness with subtle undertones that just hint at the depth of this brilliantly written horror masterpiece stephen king has never been more entertaining than with this perfectly crafted tale 5 they're creeping up on you \( 4 5 5 \) stars e g marshall bringing us back down for a soft landing romero and king conclude their horror anthology with this wonderfully bizarre tale of a millionaire hypochondriac whose allegedly germ proof apartment is overwhelmed with an army of cockroaches this one goes way over the top but it all keeps with the tempo of the movie if you know somebody who is deathly afraid of bugs try showing them the final scene of this segment then sit back and enjoy their screams of bewilderment all in all i 'd have to say creepshow is one of the top three horror films ever made rent it or buy it today ! the disc \( 1 5 \) unfortunately the geniuses over at warner bros have insulted this fine film and its fans by offering up a very lame disc the picture quality is only passable the letterbox formatting is kind of funky and there are absolutely no extras save for a trailer which i do n't really count as a real feature the only good thing i can possibly say about the disc is that it 's got 41 chapters but only 21 of those are accesible with the disc while we 'll have to wait for creepshow to get the same special edition treatment as its inferior sequel this bare bones disc only goes to show the strength of the film in the fact that even with no bonuses at all creepshow is still one of the most rewatchable and indispensable horror movies on the market	17

1	the memory card 1019 from nintendo is excellent for saving gamecube saves i used to have to delete old save files in favor of ones for newer games and some games required so much space that it was impossible to save anything from them i tried some 3rd party brands before but the gamesaves often became corrupted i have had this memory card for nearly a year now and nothing i have saved has become corrupted even with nearly 60 different gamesaves on it some for some rather large games like the sims 2 i still have more than enough space left the price is a bit more expensive but its quality has more than made up for it already	17

1	based on negative reviews either i 've been knitting too long to still have good sense or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine it is my favorite and i do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters i found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2 3 issues \( a reviewer did n't find any in a couple years of issues \) re zimmerman type designs you can make any sweater in one or two pieces change gauge needle sizes yarns etc search websites to give you the basics for free after 2 years of crochet i learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles found that quad ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain fancy aran jacquard sideways or you name it i like knit 'n style thanks for reading this	17
0	if i could give this product 0 stars i would read the negative reviews folks and be forewarned i believed the positive reviews and ignored the negative ones much to my exasperation when i plugged my handsome new oven in the little red digital display numbers came on right away hmmm so far so good but according to the instructions you are supposed to run the oven with the door open for 15 minutes to get rid of the new oven smell sooo the owner 's manual says to push the bake button on the dashboard which in turn lights the pilot lid light on the display after which you can set time and temp so i push the bake button and nothing happens no lid light comes on nothing zilch zippo so i then push the temp and time lights to try to get the gerbils to wake up still nothing i unplugged it and and plugged it in again thinking that maybe somehow i had screwed that up while listening for the beep the owner 's manual said should happen whence the unit is plugged in zilch zippo nothing no beep no bake lid light tried pusing the temp and time buttons again nada tried unpugging it again and doing the whole shebang all over again still nothing it just sat there and grinned at me about this time i figured out that my unit was also dead on arrival at least you can get a parcel paid bill of lading printed off from the amazon website for a defective product return saving yourself the annoyance of prepaying to return a dead product you have already paid for and now must wait weeks to get a refund on amazon should take the remainder of their stock of this awful product out to the back lot of their warehouse and run them over with a forklift	17

0	i found these diapers while searching for the 7th generation brand diapers i was impressed and eager to try tushies because there was no chlorine and no gell used to produce them i ordered the medium size for my 20lb baby the diapers came sooner then expected which was great my single star rating comes from my experience using them they have no elastic and they are stiff which makes it hard to get a super snug fit it seems like no matter how tight i can get the diapers my son leaks through them out the sides and up the belly because the moisture does not wick away from his skin he also developed a diaper rash his first and we have been only using these diapers for a week	17
1	the xbox 360 live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their live account even if you do have the headset the card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game \( limited time offer \) easily helps to make your money back even if they did n't include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate in fact it 's almost like you 're getting a headset for free ! so like i said if you need live buy also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at best buy i checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit	17
0	this is a magazine for paid product placement in articles tons of ads and so so articles you are paying for the name and getting much less in return i highly recommend fine homebuilding instead of this old house you will not only see fabulous new and old construction but actually take something away from it \( that is the point behind magazines right \? \) a magazine that actually saved me money ! i'm cancelling my subscription to t o h and adding another year onto my fine homebuilding subscription it 's money well spent	17

1	i am at the mid point of the book and will likely post another review when i am done the authors give the history and motivation and design decisions behind hla they also give many good examples allow you to get a really good feel for the important concepts of hla by running an actual federation one thing i will be looking for is the impact of the architecture on simulation performance scalability in practice \( as opposed to in theory \) and how is hla likely to evolve over the next couple decades i do n't know yet whether the book is enough for you to create your first federation if you really have no background at all in simulation you will still get a lot out of the first couple of chapters plus the many references to articles written on the subject but do n't expect to find the other chapters easy using my background in simulation systems i can say that hla seems to have been very well thought out based on real life simulation systems and is therefore not trivial but that 's what makes it interesting and the book so far lives up to that	17

1	there are always problems with an any type of bed even an inflatable one i am actually 21 but i do n't have a credit card so i had to use the kid review instead this bed is great of course there are problems but they do n't outweigh the good that the bed has it is great to sleep on you can carry it on trips you can have it on another bed that is in one place or on the floor i do admit it is somewhat hard to set up but it is worth the effort for the sleep is unparralleled i sleep on it every night and i have had no problems with it at all i recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress what is the most important thing of all is this is the person you bought it for happy with it	17
1	this is a good collection it 's even better if you have a ps1 emulator and a fast pc this would cut down on the lag \( of course if you have such other options arise \) some have mentioned the lag issue as one who played through these on the snes i can assure you there is horrid lag the ps2 has a faster cd drive and some form of caching for ps1 titles which helps dramatically but by no means removes the delay in chrono trigger on the console fights started with no discernable lag the creatures on the background jump out at you and you 're fighting with no visible delay beyond the jumping animation \( or whatever they do \) in ff2 4 the screen did fade black and then faded in but this took about an eighth to quarter of a second \( estimated \) chrono trigger was a great game the story is fun and the characters are great the story is non linear and you get a great feeling of control how many games give you the choice of killing off one of the bosses or accepting their help \? \( your choice affects the ending in a reasonable fashion \) ff2 \( 4 \) was also a great story when i played through it first i commented how it felt like playing through a book much less choice in progression than even in earlier ff 's though fun regardless finally he sound quality was lower on the ps version than on the original console the fade effects on the music and such are gone i have n't played through sufficiently to notice any other changes but that one was rather glaring i really liked the use of fadeing to make it sound like you were getting away from the source \( such as the millineal fair music fading as one wanders away from town \) the ps version rather ungraciously terminates at some distance and then at some further distance fires up the new music jarring the original chrono trigger would get 5 5 but these issues particularly hinder it	17
0	tony kushner 's liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his jew hatred soaked script for the film munich a paragon of self regard he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the jewish people 's attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland rather kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony \( through aboveboard land purchase and settlement prior to wars of justifiable self defense \) like his evil arab idols kushner cannot abide the concept of a restored jewish commonwealth secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy political independence and territorial sovereignty zionism and its morally necessary outcome the state of israel enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of jewish culture in the us in the post 1948 and certainly post 1967 vineyards where the klezmatics have been frolicking and where kushner has gained his fame and fortune but kushner hates the very thought of being liberated and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world jewry the klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide	17

0	this is definitely not one of my favorite books about stocks the title of the book is a little deceiving the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits chapters 1 4 are about general info such as you must buy and sell to make money do n't hold for a long time you must research the stock before purchase eps must increase every year i did n't find anything in those chapters that i did n't already know chapters 5 10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell once again the author talks about the obvious buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques the bull put spread this is not something that i use or will use in my trading chapter 12 is the concluding chapter	17

0	those of you who remember ryan starr from american idol know why she quickly became has been material for vh1 's the surreal life ryan starr also happens to be the worst actress i have ever watched on film television and or commercials the director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time her dialogue is kept short and simple and when she does have more than 3 lines at once the complete lack of feeling expression emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang nails that is all i can say i would really like to put this movie behind me and never speak of it again	17

1	the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u s constitution thomas jefferson once wrote i read no newspaper now but ritchie 's and in that chiefly the advertisements for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper letter to nathaniel macon january 12 1819 the nation is not a newspaper rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv does n't dare to those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation left wing liberal radical etc etc plato had written 2 300 years ago his allegory of the cave behold ! human beings living in an underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads plato 's punchline was and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him \? and so dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans cannot stand to look into directly it is much less painful for them simply to say the nation 's political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world situation for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation it prints the patriotic incisive truth	17

1	i like the football games especially the good ones this one is no exception in fact it may be the best i 've played i had madden 2003 and i was pretty addicted to it but 2006 changed that so many improvements have been made like the new qb vision that 's a pretty neat thing to use but it takes a while to get the hang of it you can turn it off and play old style if you want though the franchise mode has been well improved and i think i 've gotten to where i spend more time dealing with the owner things than actually playing football it 's pretty cool the only thing about that though is you can no longer turn the salary cap off so you have to contract players within the means of a budget which can teach you a lot about how owners operate the new superstar mode is cool too and you can become an nfl legend i have n't yet played the online mode yet but i hear it is good too	17
1	these are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself whenever we are out at a restaurant i just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table who knows what they wipe those tables with \? ! this is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on	17
1	we had the forerunner \( diaper genie 1 \) no matter what i did it still stunk i would add baking soda after poopy diapers line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners it always smelled like poop ! ! one day it broke so we looked for a replacement i was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one but we thought we would give it a try it 's amazing my daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench ! ! ! also it 's so easy no twisting just put the diaper thru the trap door it 's easy to load and change cartridges this is definately a great buy ! ! !	17
1	i bought this product based on my research of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions i have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events i wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips add music and burn on a dvd this program does it all and more it may not do everything extremely well but for the price well enough to put out an impressive dvd after about two hours of getting familiar with the program i was able to create a dvd that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music stunning results i played the dvd on several different brands of dvd players and had no problems looks great on tv i 've had no problems running the program on my computer i'm running this on a pentium iv 2 9 ghz 1 gig ram and 200 gb ram hd since i am a beginner weekend hobbyist this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family i'm finding much better to share on dvd than paper photos for an all in one package at this price it does the job very well and i would recommend it	17

0	while this rack looks good and appears well constructed it 's mounting system leaves something to be desired while attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around i managed to bend the locking lever now do n't get me wrong this is mounted on my wife 's bike \( a cruiser \) and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on but having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying i suppose i will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation by the way i have a delta rear rack on my atb that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp much sturdier and it was much less expensive as well	17
0	i bought this for my daughter while i was still pregnant thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months \( as well as later \) in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my 2 1 2 y o son it certainly was n't cheap so i assumed that it would be a good product and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants do n't let the product description fool you ! just as it says in some of the other reviews it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling because of it 's crappy strap tightener my daughter was a small newborn only weighing 8lbs at nearly 2 months which was the first time i tried using the sling and even being that small for the 2 minutes i had the sling on i could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen \( definitely not safe ! \) aside from that this item is so big and bulky that i literally could not even see my daughter in it i might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it there would n't have been much difference between the two i would strongly advise that you do not purchase this product ! i want to get rid of mine since it 's brand new but i threw away the box so i ca n't return it and i absolutely cannot in good concience sell it to anyone else for their child so i have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash do n't make the same mistake i did !	17
0	there are way too many credible stories about these things causing problems to risk a 400 360 putting any kind of power drawing device between a piece of sophisticated electronics and its power supply is just asking for trouble i own a lot of expensive electronics and i 'd never do it in a million years instead of taking such a chance go to your local retailer and buy a little fan \( 4 6 \) designed for placing clipping \( depending on how you 've got your xbox set up \) on your desk at work etc you can get one for 5 10 and do n't have to worry about leeching power from your 360 just set it up beside the 360 so that air flows beneath and over top since your average superstore has about a dozen fans that would fit the bill you can shop for one that 's quiet and fits your setup my 360 actually runs quite cool although i do have a small fan behind my audio rack that blows on my stereo amplifier ps always always always put electronics that generate heat in as open a location as possible never put anything on top always place on a hard surface and always leave at least a few inches clearance all around lastly always use a surge suppressor	17

0	the first shave seemed good but the second time did me in with the fusion instead of just one nick i managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once but looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock i got a merkur heavy duty double edge safety razor the blades are a huge savings merkur blades or feather double edge blades average 50 cents apiece the feather blades are extremely sharp ! the gillette sensor is more practical for me when in a big hurry a good old fashioned shave using the double edge safety razor a badger hair shaving brush some proraso shave cream in the tube is alot more enjoyable relaxing for me !	17

1	i bought this fireplace a few months ago and have enjoyed many a nice night drinking a martini and watching the fire this fireplace got me motivated to cut down the tree that died in my yard last year half way through burning it ! now for the unit it arrived nicely packed with all parts installation was a snap about 15 minutes there were dents in the screen which is obviously part of the packing process they are so small though that they cannot be seen unless someone is specifically looking for them the removable screens on the side are nice for adding more wood while the fire is still going be sure to use mitts or tongs however or you will get burned	17

0	i have owned the s410 camera for almost two years when on new years eve i pulled out my handy camera from the padded case it 's always in and to my horror the e18 error message appeared ! it has n't worked since i paid 400 for this camera and canon would like 110 \( plus taxes \) to fix the problem ridiculous especially since this seems to be a very common problem with their cameras i 've enjoyed the camera 's picture quality and ease of use but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years ! beware of this flaw that canon does n't seem to acknowledge	17

1	for years i wore asics the gt the cumulus the nimbus but i have to say if you 're fan of any asics shoes named after clouds you should try the trigon 4 very similar but cheaper also they did not joke when they called it the ride it has a very smooth transition and insane cushion but a little more support than asics for those who are neutral gait yet a tad wanting in stabilization without all the weight a big thumbs \( toes \? \) up	17

0	i drink lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant when i saw this on amazon i assumed it would be great but it is n't even though this is sold as drip grind coffee the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker the result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup and decent is as good as it gets not great not even very good just decent illy 's \( admittedly much more expensive \) drip grind delivers a much nicer smoother cup using 1 2 as much coffee so mabye it 's not all that much more expensive in the long run	17
0	well this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get unfortunately the female teenage protagonist \( played by witherspoon whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here \) acts masculine and heroic the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant at one ridiculous point the girl runs around acting like a commando a veritable one gal army blowing up the bad guys while the boy hides in a cave sniveling later when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert the gal snaps at him bella abzug style and walks quickly ahead leaving him in the dust clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men of course in the real world the result for such manly girls once they become women is that men do not choose them and they remain alone and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men of course in this movie the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy masculine gal but that 's why they call them movies when are these post modern writers artists and other culture shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females men want someone to complement them not compete with them men crave femininity in females not feminism wow is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie at least his character does progress a little bit by the end of the movie instead of craven and flippant he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual type with a wild boy haircut if that is even a step upward but the plucky gal she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside down gender relations uh another problem with this movie and there are many is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert something which should be and for a time is here depicted as a foreboding and life threatening task yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog and we see the boy 's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out of place manner considering the dire situation they are in the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light hearted inane scenes look i dig disney kid movies more realistic ones you know old style disney movies you take old yeller for example now there was a quality kid movie and quite true to life this movie was not it had a plastic spoiled american materialistic teenybopper feel throughout disney has gone down the tubes in any number of ways they 've been subverted by radical marxist agendas \( note one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion something called tapping while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un pc judeo christian religion this is bias folks leftwing pc bias same as the aforementioned feminist bilge \) i am learning to run not walk away from disney stuff and this movie was further cause for me to do so	17
1	this review is about the oral b flexisoft replacement heads coupled with the braun electric toothbrushes this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed my introduction to oral b goes back over 27 years to a usaf basic training briefing a dental technician held up an oral b toothbrush with medium bristles and said this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth or some such statement like that well i have n't lost one yet the motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites while the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing since i 've always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush i know i'm using less toothpaste to do the same job while this is no big deal the long term economic benefit is plaque under control healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth it 's kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing oral b uses a kind of color code for the bristles and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness enjoy life	17
0	since this is one of my top four all time favorite films and i love films passionately i am absolutely beside myself in fury and anger at the horrible packaging on this magnificent film i could forgive the lack of extras i know a lot of people working for these international movie conglomerates do n't give a damn about the classics \( or even movies in general really \) but the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great perfect scene by scene shot by shot movie is staggering not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring they picture the villianess not the heroine with the hero ! where is the original poster art ! ! ! ! ! the insert art ! ! ! the half sheet art ! ! ! the reissue art ! ! ! there isnt even a booklet or flyer inside nothing ! this looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff columbia pictures i am shouting at you	17
1	i'm just learning and this bible is wonderful it 's written in language i can understand \( much easier than the king james version \) and the commentary brings everything into focus there is so much extra information in this book and the commenters really took care to try to explain so a newbie like me could understand the book comes with a concordence also which is a god send \( sorry about the pun \) i 've been so engrossed in reading that i have n't even looked at the cd rom yet but i'm sure it will have great information also if you want an easy to read bible that comes with fantastic study material this is the right book for you	17
1	this movie was my all time favorite when i was little and robin hood was definitely my all time favorite disney character i remember how i 'd sit at the kitchen table and draw countless pictures of robin hood and how i 'd sit in front of our family computer and write stories involving robin hood today i have other disney favorites but i still love robin hood and i still watch the movie from time to time i'm hoping they 'll release a 2 disc special edition fairly soon robin hood makes a dashing outlaw and i love his oversized sidekick little john the villain prince john seems more comical than intimidating i love the scene where he cries for his mommy and sucks on his thumb while holding his ear at the same time seems like a childish thing for a royal prince to do do n't you agree \? if you do n't have this movie then go purchase a copy of it or at least rent it from a movie store you wo n't be disappointed	17

1	the essential jimmie rodgers is highly recommended for any serious country music fan if anyone is the genuine article it is jimmie listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including frankie and johnny mule skinner blues and t for texas there are also fine versions of waitin' for a train and in the jailhouse now though some may prefer jerry lee lewis' version of the former and the webb pierce recording of the latter the most interesting tracks are less well known these include my old pal my old sunny south by the sea and one devoted not to a mother but a father \( ! \) daddy and home for this reviewer the album hit its high point on the final track a mournful tb blues a reference to the disease that took jimmie 's life at 35 while jimmie 's yodeling style may not be for everyone this reviewer considers this album a safe bet keep in mind that jr was elected to both the country and rock and roll hall of fame further the essential series of albums rarely disappoints these almost always sponsor well produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts the essential jimmie rodgers certainly falls into that category	17
0	i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline well they need n't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday i liked both of the main actors jessica lange and ed harris the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing	17
1	a friend of mine introduced me to the babyplus system i am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the babyplus since week 20 i enjoy the 2 hours a day i use the system i feel like i am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way while using babyplus the battery cover clips snapped off i emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover no questions asked babyplus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby rather than making sure i had all the required paperwork for replacement parts	17
0	let me just say that i have thick dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp and this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess it dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage the smell was really good at first very coconuty but then after a few uses it developed a weird scent like playdoh and pepper so i just used up the rest of it as regular soap it has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars	17

1	i read this book 2 years ago and still consider it one of the most compelling and important books i have ever read besides being completely absorbed by this man 's life and experiences i learned so much valuable information about cambodia from it that i wish it was required reading for anyone traveling there blended seamlessly with the narrative you will learn of the history and culture of the cambodians the groundwork for the rise of the khmer rouge the horrors and fallacies of life under a communist regime and the story of pol pot i also gained an insight into buddhist thought and daily life in cambodia all of which prepared me well for my trip there haing ngor 's life story also helped me understand the damaging psychological consequences endured by the victims of this holocaust and of the difficulties cambodians have had in trying to adjust to life in america there are a lot of lessons to be learned from this book and many which can give us a better ability to analyze current international events if you read no other book about cambodia read this one	17
1	eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness it is also horrific to watch i had heard the parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the president 's right ear they should know they were there right \? the film shows otherwise if there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret show me someone who can keep a secret if the us government is hiding evidence why is this footage available \? no one can tell where a shot came from by the target 's movement the answer to where jfk 's missing brain is here the third shot pulverized it turning it into a red mist had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage this is history which cannot be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads see for yourself	17

0	this has got to be the worst film i 've ever seen its not sad its not funny jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage i do n't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him the actor is the worst of all i cant tell if he 's sad in some seens or angry or jest retarded i 've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks i guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present it probably worked better back in 96' but this movie is so so so bad its embarrassing do not rent it or buy it or view it on television note's this film had some great talenta song from olivia newton jon and \( one of my most personal favorites \) mila and my favorite comedians margaret cho she 's to good but why this film she \( and mila \) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this	17
0	the writing was not what i expect of andre norton too many gaps and information that is disjointed whether this is a consequence of collaboration i do n't know i felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened for example at the start we know kirion has sent people to capture his sister the book covers over 2 years but you hardly hear of this again i cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop i am a long time fan and retired children 's librarian sic fi fantasy is my favorite genre but this one i had to push to finish unsatisfying	17

1	this is a good holster for my v220 it doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did for a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt one problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well and also because it holds it where the strap is it adds a little wear to that area other than that its a good holster for the price and thats another one of my problems i paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall which was highly over priced for my standards amazon seems like a great place to buy it but if you search for motorola v220 phone accessories then you can find a site with free shipping for it and its 7 bucks theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks but with shipping i trust amazons shipping though so if you want a functional holster get this one	17

1	i have been a subscriber to family fun for 4 years and i have always enjoyed the magazine i do n't remember ever being disappointed in an issue i usually will read a magazine once just for entertainment value and then go back later and sort out the articles ideas i want to keep on file for future reference in most magazines this equates to a few pages to hang on to at the most with family fun i always end up with a huge stack of ideas that i want to hang on to what is even better is that these are tips and bits of information that i actually use and apply in our everyday lives practical useful and fun are all words i would use to describe this publication my favorite features include my great idea submitted by readers family almanac seasonal activities and resourcesand the travel ideas we have discovered many great places that our on our list to visit someday and we have even been able to add some wonderful and educational fun to trips we have already had planned some reviews have complained about the magazine being owned by disney i'm not sure why that is such a problem but i do realize some people do n't like disney the truth is that some major corporation owns just about everything major magazine out there anyway at least the disney company has helped family fun gain a bigger audience and provided a fantastic web site as a resource companion to the magazine i do n't find that disney is overly promoted \( a rarity in the world of disney i know ! \) in this magazine there are plenty of reviews and references to very non disney products such as the harry potter series shrek movies and hundreds of travel ideas that have nothing to do with anything related to a disney enterprise this magazine has definitely earned the 5 star rating	17

1	the matcha tea is exactly what i expected extremely green great flavor keep in mind i'm in no way a matcha expert but from my limited experience with this type of tea \( starbucks etc \) it was great got the product within days of ordering it far before the estimated date of delivery highly recommend this seller	17

1	stylish and comfy what more could you ask for \? my husband was very pleased	17
1	harry potter and the chamber of secrets the second harry potter film in the series was the first bit of the harry potter phenomenon i was every exposed to i 'd kind of avoided the boy wizard before then but after seeing it those couple of years ago even though i did n't entirely follow what was what and who was who i realized it was pretty entertaining after reading the second book recently i picked up the dvd and watched it again the series gets a little darker like the books do but unlike the book i do n't think the jump is as large which i reckon is a good thing though i prefer the first film it 's still good to watch it 's harry 's \( daniel radcliffe 's \) second year at hogwart 's wizards school and after a shaky summer he returns to find himself in the midst of a sinister plot it seems a certain heir of slytherin has opened the legendary chamber of secrets loosing a monster that is wandering about petrifing students literally ! many fingers point to harry harry 's finger points to malfoy and ron 's wand well that does n't point at all as its broken and backfiring what 's this all got to do with the mysterious trails spiders haunted toilets a rogue quidditch bludger and a self flagellating house elf \? can harry ron and hermione figure things out \? all the kids are a little bit older and a little bit wiser in this film plus the boys' voices are breaking in some scenes they 're kind of croaky sounding in other scenes they have their child voice and in others their voices broken through not neccesarily in that order there 's a couple of new kids \( like colin creevey \) and they are just as well cast as the others the new adults are well cast too though not my favorite performance of his career shakespearean actor kenneth branagh makes an interesting gilderoy lockhart the vain second year dark arts teacher he played it a lot more subtley than i expected him to ex fast show comedian mark williams plays mr weasley which i reckon was a great choice i missed some of the cast from the last film though you hardly see warwick davis \( who plays professor flitwick \) let alone hear him say anything and john cleese 's nearly headless nick who has a rather significant deathday party in the book has hardly anything to do here except get petrified there were other things cut out too like the catching of the garden gnomes at the weasley 's the fans of the book will feel the absence more than the casual viewers though personally i like to think of the harry potter films as illustrations to the books put into motion rather like the pictures in the world of hogwarts they give an idea of what the book would look like an impression special features include an interview with author j k rowling and script writer steve kloves as well as interviews with all the kids and all the main adult actors there 's also slick virtual tours through diagon alley dumbledore 's office and gilderoy lockhart 's classroom \( a tour that turns out to be just as pretentious as he is complete with gushing praises from the narrator \) there 's also a couple of games you can visit the chamber of secrets after answering some harry potter trivia you can drive the flying car through the forbidden forest \( which i found frustrating but addictive \) there 's also a trivia game about what spell does what too unlike the first dvd you do n't have to beat any games to access the deleted scenes you 're able to go to them straight from the main menu just as well there 's 19 of them and some of them are pretty significant notable scenes include harry 's close encounter with the malfoys in the dark magic shop harry discovering that filch is taking wizard lessons by correspondence i wish they 'd left some of these scenes in particularly the ones where harry potter questions his nature is he a good wizard or a bad wizard that was some mighty fine character development cut there ! there 's also a gallery of design drawings and a section called colin creevey 's darkroom where you can select pictures of various characters then play them in a slideshow of sorts apparently there 's a whole stack of stuff in the dvd rom features but i just could n't get them to work on my laptop 's dvd drive using interactual player \( the player that many warner brothers films have you install to play their dvds \) it says there is a script error and when i tried windows media player 9 and cyberlink powerdvd 4 0 though it ran the dvd and everything else with it fine the dvd acted as if it was n't in a dvd rom drive telling me that if i put the dvd into my pc 's drive i 'd get all these wonderful features it was in my dvd drive ! aggh ! it is in a dvd drive maybe its just my type of laptop \( benq dh5100u 1 5 gigahertz \) ah well it looked like it would have been really fun especially for fans of the series all in all its definitely worth a look for harry potter fans but i would recommend you read the book first	17
0	the pages of men 's journal used to be an escapist weekend getaway in themselves they brought you to extreme parts of the globe with a literary style that disappeared after 9 11 since that time mj has concentrated on telling its readers who their heros should be which might have been fine for one issue this is a magazine badly in need of a new editor and old ideas	17
0	this straightener has been one of the worst i have ever used it did n't straighten at all i had to go over sections of my hair more than 10 times to get it at least semi straight it did not stay straight either 60 br 62 waste of money ! ! ! don't buy	17

1	in all the talk about education issues these days it 's easy to forget that what 's really important is the relationship the energy between students and teacher when the teacher closes his door and is face to face with thirty kids that's where it 's at it 's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum it 's what happens between people in a classroom this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager active kids and a caring active teacher it 's not all pleasant and successes are sometimes small but a pervasive caring underlies it all as a teacher this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork go for a walk go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day	17
1	if you liked raise the red lantern or the last emperor this is a perfect movie gong li who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband 's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband farewell my concubine uses chinese opera as a way of telling the story i used to listen to a lot of chinese opera which is an acquired taste this movie uses the story of a king his beloved concubine 's self sacrifice to frame the love story between two men when one of the men falls in love with and marries a woman the stage is set for a tragic love triangle the final scenes are chilling powerful this is a spectacle not to be missed	17
0	do n't waste your money i bought two of these a few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year i put one in my gardern a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight ! total waste of money like everthing else i 've tried except nash loop traps	17
1	these burgers are unbelievable they are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger they are omaha steaks best product and the only thing i order from them i actually love the packaging each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic which means i can keep them in the freezer until i am ready to eat them then defrost them in warm water and in 10 minutes i have fresh red meat they have a nice peppery angus beef smell and they taste great they never go to waste i find the meat i buy in the stores these days ca n't compare at all them smell of the meat does n't smell fresh more like plastic than meat ok the styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times amazon also has a great price on these after a quick search around the web this looks to be the best price	17
0	i normally buy special k cereal i found these boxes to be stale	17
1	this is a surprisingly good radio at this price it is small compact and yet very robust and quite heavy it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store here are three things i really liked about this product 1 \) the am fm reception is outstanding i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure 2 \) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function this is something sangean seems to get very well 3 \) the multi level display lighting can be turned off or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright a few things i did n't like the pilot light for on is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night i had to put black electrical tape over it the aux input is a mini jack instead of rca connector minor inconvenience here and finally the cabinet is nice wood but the finish is not as good as i think it could be this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price it 's a keeper	17
1	we have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone we just love it and so does our 6 month old	17
0	do n't buy this product i went through two units with the same problem the trimmer is made of cheap plastic with plastic tabs to snap onto to the blade within less than one week the tabs broke and the trimmer would no longer stay attached further the base stand is just a lightweight piece of junk that does not properly hold the handle and accessories very poorly designed wahl should be embararssed it did a nice job of trimming my beard but the attachments are so awkward to install and remove the base practically useless and the trimmer tabs break so easily that i would have given it no stars if possible the fact that i returned one unit only to get a second that broke within a week makes me wonder what good the two year warranty is worth	17
0	this game is one hot mess i bought it for my mom for christmas we decided to play the 2 player game thinking it would be fun well the word my mother used to describe it is excruciating this was the slowest and most boring thing i 've ever played there is at least a 10 second pause between each function \( choosing a case opening the case howie giving you directions taking turns looking at your opened case you name it \) each time you switch back to the other player the screen literally goes black ! you only see the suitcase girls in the beginning and the end when a case is opened you only see two arms breasts and the case ! when it is your turn to pick a case there is complete silence as you scroll and i use the term loosely up and down to pick a number for a video game which you assume to move quickly you 'd better set aside at lease an hour to play it you will be exhausted when you 're through we suggest they go back to the drawing board and stop with all the pauses play some theme music when you are choosing your case show the girl who opens your case have the audience clap anything ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if you buy this game you only have yourself to blame p s i won 750 000 and did n't even care i was just glad it was over	17

1	i have the same opinion as everyone else the controller is very convenient appealing affordable and fun but it suddenly stopped working i think there are some problems with the wireless connection and its very frustrating being in the middle of the action and boom your controller stops respondind and you get killed it sucks ! ! ! i see that a lot of people have the same problem that i do what i do to solve it is changing the batteries and then putting them back again or use the dual shock for a while and then plug the logitech again that has worked for me it sounds silly but somehow works so if you want a great wireless controller this is it but be aware that this problem is a little annoying and you probably will have it too	17
1	i travel a lot so something like this i would use to replace all my other usb cables its compact and easy to store away i forget which seller i purchase from but its small lightweight and shoudl ship quick	17
0	i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel 15 klh speakers that sound better than this no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end after a year of misery on my ears i 've replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost 20 more and the difference is not even comparable do not buy this or any bose product at all save your money and buy paradigm b w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money 's worth	17
0	the scale is everything the manufacturer claims however with minimal use by one average sized adult our scale lasted only about nine months the balance part of the scale is very sound but the battery clip that powers the electronics is poorly designed and built of very cheap components i suspect that poor q a will result in a fairly high percentage of these units failing and recommend that you go elsewhere today my scale will not function unless i hold the batteries by hand \( not too practical when someone is standing on it \) conclusions scale design is nice looks good construction of balance components is solid glass is very strong design and construction of the power unit \( battery \) is rather poor scale functions as advertised for a normal sized \( 80kg 175lb \) adult until the battery power clip dies buyers should avoid this scale in favor of something with more solid battery compartment and connections hope this helps !	17
1	love love love this scent i have received many compliments about it long lasting and definitely addictive i think its more of a late fall and winter scent if i do say so myself	18
1	i mainly get stuff like this because i like the looks not that i actually use the merchandise that much the knife seems sturdy and strong the nylon sheath is high quality	18
0	the only good thing i can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink it 's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly otherwise i cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward i will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me \( i'm a nanny \) i do n't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already i would think that if something is deemed an infant ' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up	18
1	i'm very pleased with this tea i boil a pot of water and then take the lid off and let it cool to the right temperature which is around 200 degrees fahrenheit i let it steep for about five minutes and then remove my infuser and pour myself a cuppa nice light oolong it 's good and relaxing arrived in the container seen in the picture with the tea sealed up in a little plastic bag inside of it i 'd recommend it	18

1	i bought two of these for my son hoping to wean him out of pull ups at night without having to strip the whole bed when there is an accident this pad is definitely leakproof the only con is that even though it says it has an anti slip backing that is not the case i have tried it with jersey sheets and flannel sheets but it does move alot and get bunched up so i do end up having to strip the bed every now and then because the pad moved during the night if i had it to do over again i would definitely buy the pad with the tuck under flaps	18
1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	18
1	this is a monumental movie that helped to shape the identity of jamaica after its independence from britain the character work is very good and the plot gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on to top it up the soundtrack on this movie is trully great the only negative with this particular dvd is that it is slightly below par for a criterion transfer having seen quite a few criterions i can say that i was not particularly impressed with the quality on that one i am sure though that criterion must have done the best they could with whatever raw material they had available	18
1	the devil 's backbone is a horror movie like you 've never seen before a good and intelligent one it really is not a horror movie however but a story which involves ghosts \( or the past \) and how they fuel our present actions and decisions it is a strange and memorable film from spain which will make you think as much as it scares you worth seeing	18

1	the cold steel spike tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price it is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily it has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size i have ever seen virtually indestructible the case is excellent if plain this knife leaves very wide wounds in steak i think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds on the down side it does n't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and i wear a medium glove overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense it is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain it is a knife that wo n't let you down when the going gets tough used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient	18
1	ok for those of you who continue to believe that new york is the center of the united states hell the world who forgot the map cnn kept flashing with the two different colors after the election that might infer there are several schools of thought about the polycentric views of the us for those of you who can take a little criticism from the midwest the dark states middle earth the elba of the 21st century you 're not there 's a whole world out here people have jobs yes it 's true we work send our kids to school even go to church on sundays and on other days too we vote oh yeah you already know that so having an interview with an actor who goes on about how he meditates is a vegan and thinks about trees and birds when he has a particularly stressful scene with ashley or uma or diane you know it just does n't carry a lot of weight with the serfs but it 's a great magazine andy lives photography is tight and realistic the ads are sexy and provocative the sidebars interesting and insightful it 's wordly it covers music as well as rs it 's \( do n't get all riled up now \) a fun magazine to read however the interviews which we are led to believe are the heart and soul of the magazine seem to be along the lines of 'damn it 's so good to be me and i guess you 're ok too ' or 'i see you 're wearing a 15 000 versace with a plunging neckline and you 've selected old black converse all stars to wear with it ! how noveau ! how tasteful ! 'come on where 's the bite \? where 's the interview with alex rodriguez that says 'how come you went to therapy it 's only new york \? ' or with marv alpert 'hey what 's on your fashion agenda now \? 'chris berman from espn says he was on maui a couple of years back and he was walking with his kids one dawn and he ran into steven stills with his kids now that 's a conversation i would have liked to hear not one that ends up with me thinking the two parties to the conversation \( it sure is n't an interview see columbia university 's interviewing 101 in their school of journalism \) are off to pick out furniture it 's new york show your teeth flex 5 stars larry scantlebury	18

1	the immersion process is the only one that works and this product is a first rate immerser making the study painless even immensely pleasurable as one realizes he she is coming to own a new language and perspective in working with students it is the best head start method that i know of comparable to one on one study for at least a year with an accomplished tutor unlike less effective methods it quickly achieves the essential purpose of deeply internalizing the language if one does each of the processes thoroughly of course continued study especially in acquiring vocabulary is necessary just as it is for those acquiring a native language the study of any language is ongoing i would give this program 50 stars if that option were available	18

0	in 1973 director nicholas roeg took a daphne du maurier story about a strained family situation added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction cast wonderful talented actors such as donald sutherland and julie christie and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror the unmissable do n't look now six years later cronenberg obviously oh so obviously having been influenced by the starkly pared down imagery and understated elegance of the roeg picture decided to put his own markedly different spin on a terribly similar theme with disasterously boring results to synopsise the plot frank carveth 's estranged wife is crazy and undergoing unconventional therapy at her psychiatrist 's controversial institute suspecting her of abusing their daughter he removes her from his wife 's care to the strenuous objections of her shrink several people connected to wifey 's emotionally crippling past begin to show up dead and carveth finds himself fighting to save his daughter from her crazy mother 's 'other' set of kids so it 's david cronenberg so what \? performances and direction as well as screenplay are all simply mundane there 's barely a shred of the sleek polished talent we have come to recognise as david cronenberg and what we have instead is a sort of mishmash of some of the better aspects from classic american horror movies as seen through the obviously tired eyes of the writer director it 's almost got the sense of isolation of 'the shining' but there are too many incidental characters it 's almost got the same sense of murder by numbers as 'hallowe'en' but lacks the decisive action of that movie it 's close to the stark imagery and sense of motherhood gone awry as 'carrie' \( and even the lead actress bears a striking resemblance to piper laurie ! \) but samantha eggar 's performance is too overblown makeup effects too are over ambitious for the time and fail to create any sense of impact or drama in that they just look silly of course you could say the same for 'the exorcist' nowadays but where that film still has the incredible strength of ellen burstyn 's and linda blair 's performances all 'the brood' has to go on is some deformed alien figures that hiss a lot it 's not good in short where a movie matters most 'the brood' fails wholly to deliver instead regaling us with 90 or so minutes of unfulfilling cinema a note on the subtext it 's difficult to feel any sort of respect for the social commentary contained herein sure topics like the state of the nuclear family and the negative effects of a mother 's love are riveting things when handled properly unfortunately when the package and presentation are so obviously hollow and overdone who could care less about subtext \? i could n't	18
1	after reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the psc 55 i was still undecided on a case for my canon sd630 so i purchased both to see for myself which one would work because red is my favorite color i really wanted the red case to fit \( psc 90 \) the camera will fit in the case but it 's a very tight fit i had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close the psc 55 is still a very snug fit but allows for some extra breathing room which i feel is better for the safety of the camera in addition here 's something to consider if you 're deciding between the two cases the inside lining of the psc 90 is more of a rigid nylon material while the lining of the psc 55 is a softer felt material the case overall is still rigid but i like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining based on that alone i'm going with the psc 55 i feel that this will be more friendly to the 3 screen on the sd630 both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive i'm pleased with the canon brand	18
0	i love running to the marine corps cadence cds volumes 1 and 2 are very good volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral when running vols 1 2 are better synched for continuous running the transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me others do n't seem to agree and i still run to this cd i 'd buy 1 and 2 first if you do n't have them	18
1	this lounge deck chair cushon is worth every penny it is thick comfortable \( none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion \) available in several color choices and has a soft not plasticky cover fabric you will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit it just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because i had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms but all turned out well and i must say i am very happy with it it is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper but much thinner types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer get the best this is it	18
1	make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of l series lenses are compatible if you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition the af only works with lenses f 4 and faster on most camera bodies you do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body but the extra reach is really nice	18
1	many years ago an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low rent motel one morning while he was in the back office behind the front desk two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door he could see them but they could not see him through the privacy security glass the men continued to beat on the door trying to get in he waited inside patiently with his glock pistol as soon as the door fell and the men ran inside he shot them both they turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money i recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions it turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help when asked why he had to kill them he simply said i own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety i did it because it was my right and i could fortunately it was considered self defense i remembered that he always carried a short stick attached to his keys it was not until many years later that i finally figured out what that little wooden stick was i became interested in self defense and decided to buy a baton for myself this was my first kubaton i was concerned because this one has a pointed end the pointed end although not sharp compared to a blade weapon will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part i was afraid that if ever i had to use it the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that i was acting in self defense i bought another kubaton from the same manufacturer with a flat end the replacement baton is exactly like this one except the end is flat i tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas but it takes a lot more force to do so more importantly to the average person it looks less aggressive than this one if i had to use it in self defense a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon if you are not concerned about perception then get this pointed baton if it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth \( the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags outerwear and hiking shoes \) it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes but please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife that might make it difficult to claim self defense in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself my old acquaintance was well versed and knowledgeable he not only knew how to use his weapons but he also understood where the line is between self defense and assault he knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself this pointed baton made out of hardened aluminum alloy is probably for such a person my friend's tip here 's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine the keys themselves are a part of the weapon and you can make them more effective which will increase the damage from the baton take some keys that you no longer use any metal key would do but try to find different sizes about four of them would do take the keys to a grinder \( even a rasp will do \) and sharpen the teeth of each key now put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys face the sharp keys in opposite directions meaning two should face one way but the other two should face in the opposite direction the idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker 's flesh the keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging citan's experiment please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand i tried this technique i wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post the sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand without the gloves my hand would have gotten badly cut for what it 's worth i swung against a large watermelon and the keys did n't bounce back though i do n't have anything else to add here except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker 's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding i'm not an expert though but it was fun trying it on a watermelon	18

1	first tried this tea from a specialty store in buffalo ny where it sold for close to 60 lb love it even though it was only 2 oz search the net for this tea and found it amazon it 's a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water it is non acidic like some other teas it need no addition of cream or sweetner i'm currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light it 's not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color with the hint of a flora or fruity taste the added plus at amazon is the price and very quick shipping i would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and i'm sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea	18
1	after reading being peace i ordered additional copies for all my close friends this book is both thought provoking and accessible thich nhat hanh has a way of presenting buddhist lessons and ways of being ways of living and thinking about ourselves and our relationships to others and the world in a style that is almost deceptively simple and deeply thoughtful i highly recommend this book as either an introduction to buddhist thought or as a way of enriching any life	18
0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	18

0	they changed pretty much everything for starters they completely removed all of the normal menus such as file tool and edit which means you ca n't use the keyboard for quick and easy menu access well maybe you can but you would have to memorize all of the commands instead of having the nice little visual cues which made previous versions of office \( and almost all other pc programs \) so much easier to use you basically have to use the mouse for everything and in my experience there is no faster way to repetitive stress injury than over mousing the ribbon is just awful first of all it 's huge it takes up about four times the space of my customized toolbar they place nearly every button imaginable on it and as far as i can tell you ca n't change it around or simplify it every function is displayed all the time whether you need it or not which makes finding anything a real pain in the neck you can make the ribbon retract which at first glance seems nice but in reality it turns what used to be simple 1 click operations into 3 click operations \( extend ribbon spend several minutes searching for button click button retract ribbon \) good grief ! what a pain this software did n't last 24 hours on my system before i restored my old version of office this new interface is about the most awful thing i 've ever seen on a computer i know of certain free open source office suites that i prefer to this monstrosity that being said i still prefer any and all previous versions of ms office to the free one in fact i would rather be using my old wordperfect from 1995 than this thing that ms is trying to shove down our throats if only i had n't thrown that disc away six years ago before you invest your money in this software i strongly recommend you download the free trial version then buy an earlier version	18

0	you can breeze through this book in under an hour i just did while it makes for a suspenseful albeit entertaining account of what happened that infamous night damore relies too heavily on witnesses' accounts and police remarks \( often little more than kennedy bashing \) by now most of us can accept the facts that emk drank way too much and drove off a bridge subsequently leading to tragedy dui accidents happen every day chillingly often to average people the fact that this happened to one of the greatest senators in the history of the united states only reaffirms this	18
0	i bought this mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a 200 dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service \? do n't count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product	18
1	there are complaints about win xp sp2 being too expensive or complaints about technical problems it is too expensive but it is the standard at so many companies big and small around the world i just wanted to say that anyone who gives windows xp sp2 a one star rating really does n't understand much about the windows operating system and therefore you should not take into consideration their uneducated opinion about operating systems in general the price is a bit high but windows is what it is a dominant operating system	18

0	my daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game she wants to play it constantly so it 's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours the dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily it takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it there are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you ca n't go over that numbers i e you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that 's allowed that 's confusing when you 're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you 'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you 're trying to reach	18
1	a trained eye would see that shock coffee is a blend of arabica robusta coffee beans ! just like many other ingredients there is good and bad robusta arabica beans wines are made from different grapes and it 's the individuals' pallet that distinguishes between good and bad in europe the coffee bean of choice is robusta as they appreciate a stronger and bolder coffee with that said i 'd recommend shock for anybody who wants that extra kick with a better than average taste i 'd also like to reiterate that robusta beans are given a bad rap but the truth stands that some robusta beans have a great robust taste no pun attended !	18
0	i bought this seat for 40 on sale at toys r us since it stated it would fit most bikes i followed the directions that came with the seat and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that i tried it on after several choice words and approximately 2 1 2 hours later per bike \( 5 hours total \) i finally had this piece of crap installed only to find out that both my and my wife 's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat do not buy this piece of crap it is not worth any amount of money as far as i'm concerne	18
0	in theory this boot seemed perfect added some height came in perfectly wearable colors was made of real leather the price was unbeatable but \( yes unfortunately a big but \) like everything else which seems perfect it was perfectly flawed i did my research read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual but still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet totally crushing my veins i'm a big shoe collector and i can recognize a design error when i see one surprisingly that it came from this brand usually so quality reliable these boots are not meant for walking if you want to take a pretty picture in them they might fulfill that purpose	18
1	my 2 year old saw this in bjs and kept asking for it so santa brought it for him for christmas i think it 's a good first guitar he loves to strum it but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument not a toy so far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it 's held up fine but i do n't think it would hold up with such continued abuse it is recommended for children much older than he is so i ca n't expect anything different i do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him for a better price than i see at amazon you can get a small hohner guitar at a music store which might be better quality i'm not sure regardless i am very happy with this guitar and i would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music i would not buy it for a child just as a toy unless you do n't mind it being destroyed i am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when i get it	18

1	i recall first hearing about bag balm at an adult scout leader training retreat one of the participants started talking about bag balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm needless to say i was intrigued and upon returning from the retreat did a little more investigating when i asked my wife whether she had ever heard of the stuff she immediately said that she had and that one of my toddler nephews was then using bag balm under a doctor 's direction for pesky diaper rash i then began to question some of my horse riding buddies they too had heard of it and used it with very positive results i immediately went out and bought a big tin for my medicine cabinet and a couple of small more portable tins to keep around my office and car and use as lip balm i could n't be more pleased i have used bag balm as an excellent lip balm and have used it on minor cuts and abrasions as well rubbed directly into the skin under band aids you name it the stuff as originally touted by my scouting friend seems also to have antibacterial properties now i am not a doctor and i do n't play one on tv so please do n't take that as some sort of prescription putting it in a nutshell bag balm is incredible stuff and it works i highly recommend it ! the horsema	18

0	i mainly bought this album because i was going to see them on this tour in fact the gig i was at was the opening show on the tour again the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again i find most of this album to be very average actually after listening this album is not very good at all the majority of the songs are clich ridden in both music and lyrics there are a couple of catchy tracks most notably safe in new york city which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic probably one of the bands weakest efforts	18

1	make no mistake chato 's land is a sprawling unforgiving environment that offers little water and no reward the blistering sprawling landscape of rock and sagebrush however is but a backdrop in this story that shows man at his most ugly of moments charles bronson stars as pardon chato a half apache indian who is enjoying a drink in a saloon when he is antagonized by an arrogant sheriff chato goes against the sheriff 's wishes to leave because of his heritage and lets his actions speak for themselves leaving the mouthy lawman dead on the floorboards a posse is soon rounded up with a variety of area men many of them farmers and ranchers they embark on a trip to find chato and avenge the death in town as well as feed some of their own continual hatred towards the indians in general greed hate and perseverance battle logic pride and tolerance as the group soon start battling each other over what they think is right and wrong when it comes to avenging the death of the lawman a great western film from 1971 chato 's land offers a solid and stoic storyline that is wrought with irony as well as themes of loyalty and revenge charles bronson aside a superb supporting cast is experienced as well victor french \( later of little house and highway to heaven stardom \) graces the screen as one of the posse members and with jack palance and james whitmore in tow its a well rounded cast that never lacks quality in acting despite a somewhat linear storyline palance plays the part of quincy whitmore a war veteran who understands and sometimes even respects the apache 's actions more than most his arch nemesis is jubal hooker \( played by simon oakland \) who has the fever of wanting to see the apache man hang even if it costs them lives which could end up coming down to the last man jubal is excellently played by oakland as a man who is consumed with his own destiny of vengeance loyalties loved and lost a large part of the movie is very emotional in power and prestige as we experience the dismay of the men as they deal with the battles that rage within their very own camp and minds with bronson portraying a cunning intelligent and yes even ruthless apache warrior chato 's land is a western that is filled with buzzards drinking blood the dark side of man and the notion that if you go to battle with someone in their own back yard you better think twice about who has the best odds regardless of how many men you bring with you the scenic landscape and the shots taken at night as well as during the scorching hot days are excellent and the sound quality of this dvd in my opinion is very good if not perfect if you want a western that gets dirty but portrays a deep story within see chato 's land	18

1	i have n't tried it with the light gun yet but even with 2 dual shocks this is a unique and accessible 2 player co op game \( one drives one shoots \) with decent replay value i do n't think the difficulty can be increased but it 's fun to go back and beat your old scores and play with the unlocked cars i suppose it could be finished in a rental but personally i find it 's nice to own some simple co op games like this that you can pop in and play right away if a friend shows up esp if that friend is not a hardcore gamer as a 1 player game it starts to feel like gta lite after awhile although for kids this one is better because it lacks the mature content	18

0	i am by no means a computer idiot i audit computer systems security for a living i have had to contact customer support \( webchat \) at least 3 4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software the install was on a brand new system \( windows xp pro \) with all of the microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed first pest patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an active protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes \( which you had to click to clear each one \) second the firewall would tell me i was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode third pest patrol never would run a thorough scan i 'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the pest patrol gui or that system resources was not available i contacted the customer support and they told me that yes sometimes pest patrol does n't work at all unless you use msconfig to disable all startup services \( systems ini etc \) reboot run pest patrol then use msconfig to enable the startup services it was a canned reply during a live web session which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people i have n't tried out the third solution yet because i wanted to remind myself to write an amazon review if you are looking for simplicity or do n't know much about computers look elsewhere otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds i 'll give it two stars since it did n't cause my dog to choke explode my house or cause irreparable damage to clothing \( which is my one star \)	18

0	children love to follow instructions step by step and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep drag on for hours any adult who cooks like this does n't cook often cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen for example who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter melts it in a pan then pours it into a \( plastic microwave safe \) mixing bowl \? great now there 's a pan a knife and a cutting board to wash ! it is a children 's cookbook so why not cut down on time spent with knives stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave \? nice pictures large font recipes are great but \( in my opinion \) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen not a home	18

0	when i first purchased the low budget movie named pranks i did n't really know what to expect after all pranks is a slasher horror movie from the 80s a very fertile period for such movies and time period which quite honestly produced some pretty good slasher and horror movies in general unfortunately after viewing pranks i can honestly say that this is not one of them pranks is about a group of college kids who are staying on campus over the holidays preparing a building which is going to be torn down i think \( herein lies another problem in that it is very difficult to understand what is going on in this movie because the acting is so poor \) obviously most kids have gone home for christmas and new year 's except for this group of kids and one weird kid who ostensibly becomes the lead suspect as gruesome murders begin to occur the murders remain largely unbeknownst to the characters in the movie so the director and screenplay writer wanted to give the audience information to which the main characters are not privileged the plot is decent enough although the execution is formulaic generic and lacks luster throughout the film one of the reasons for this is the pathetic acting we see in this movie which really overshadows any kind of merit this movie is able to produce as a horror movie there is no question that pranks is a low budget production to begin with and along with that there is going to be some subpar acting but the acting in pranks is borderline awful ! ! it is this acting and poor direction that really makes it difficult for the tasteful horror movie viewer to stay interested in fact the movie comes off very generic in style and substance and rather predictable and boring the only thing that is even remotely interesting are the kills which are n't too bad considering the era in which this movie came out from the director does use some weak misdirection to attempt to keep the audience guessing as to who the killer is but the savy horror movie audience can clearly identify the weird guy as a red herring as another reviewer put it in summary pranks is a poorly executed attempt at a horror movie which suffers from terrible acting extremely poor production values and flawed direction the result is a dull boring and weak horror movie with a few decent kills certainly nothing to write home about also as a final note the actor who plays the killer does a terrible job and comes off in the end at least like a total wuss	18
1	i did a ton of research on convertible infant toddler car seats before my son outgrew his graco snugride at 4 months consumer reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings \( this seat had the highest rating of all britax convertible seats ! \) i chose this seat because it has eps side impact protection under the carseat cover it 's worth the extra money because it 's your child 's life ! also it 's really easy to tighten and loosen the straps and the cover is really silky and comfortable my son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway my only gripes are that none of the existing toddler pillow neck head supports fit into the seat but that may be a problem with the manufacturers of the supports not britax also the straps do n't have soft covers to keep them from digging into my son 's neck i just bought some soft terrycloth ones from babies r us for 4 99 it works	18

1	without a doubt the highlight is the dvd of the 1975 show in london born to run the album had put him on the cover of time and newsweek the same week in october 1975 one of the very few times that has happened for a non news story the publicity and hype generated by columbia records was so overwhelming that there was a backlash nobody can be that good so here we see his first show ever in the uk playing to an audience of professional critics and amateur skeptics people thinking hey 'rock and roll future ' this is the land of the beatles the rolling stones the who who do you think you 're kidding no unknown kid from america deserves 'time' and 'newsweek ' the show begins in almost total darkness a piano softly plays then harmonica and a soft spotlight lights the kid from new jersey who sings thunder road accompanied by only piano an unknown song at the time thunder road has become a springsteen classic imho especially given the expectations it is a perfect understated opening the dvd has the entire show including everything from the hard rock of she 's the one and born to run the song to a much slowed down version of for you an underated sleeper on his first album greeting from asbuty park nj bruce accompanies himself on the piano and i swear this version of for you is so beautiful it could be the scruffy new jersey kid channeling god any skeptic who walked out of this show thinking springsteen was merely hype has no ears no taste or was xenophobic the show gives more than a big hint that this springsteen guy is for real as a songwriter and performer and that born to run especially is an extraodinary album there are only eight songs but none are fill repeated listenings of the four corners of the album \( before cds \) backstreets jungleland thunder road and the title song are so good they become well addictive works of genius and lead to still more listening tenth avenue freeze out night and especially she 's the one could each be the centerpiece of almost any other album even the whispered meeting across the river fits and helps the album become a coherent whole the songs taken together are more than the sum of the parts as a footnote i 'll offer the opinion that bruce only wrote one other album that is as good as born to run and that is his next one darkness on the edge of town everything he has released is good a good bit of it is great but i do n't think anything else matches born to run or darkness i do n't know if two other back to back albums this good have ever been released the dvd of the show gives us a big early peek at the guy who would develop into rock 's greatest performer by 1985 he would be the biggest rock star in the world selling out multiple nights at football stadiums the remastered cd is nothing special to my ears perhaps an audiophile could hear improvement the dvd the making of 'born to run ' is interesting but will probably appeal mainly to fans however the dvd of the 1975 london show ought to appeal to anyone who likes bruce or rock roll or showmanship or history its a treat	18

1	bird is a film about the life of jazz great charlie the bird parker forest whitaker is doing a great job as charlie parker and the story is generally loyal to the real life except one is lead to believe that chan was his wife \( in real life she was n't \) one negative thing i felt was that the scenes were overly dark throughout the film i think the director wanted to create an atmosphere of reality but in my opinion he overdid it to the point of annoyance another critisism is for a film about charlie parker his talent on improvisation his creativity could have been and should have been emphasized more there is a scene where he asks a friend to write a piece that he composed just that night and the friend wants to do it in the morning but by the next morning charlie does n't even remember the piece or even the conversation that took place this is a good example but his creativity could have been emphasized with more examples like improvisation in real life charlie parker played the same piece of music differently almost every time with some additions here and there givin it a new mood new angle new taste this could have been shown however despite these minor shortcomings i think the film is a very good one for charlie parker fans i also strongly suggest the book bird lives by ross russell	18

1	peter balakian 's book black dog of fate tries to be too many thingsand sadly fails at many of them in essence it is an attempt to tell asort of armenian american story which i find not overly interesting orcompelling i wish the author had done a bit more in depth work to learnabout his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent itor explain it or share it with non armenians for he has much more to absorband understand himself first i find the armenianness in this book to betentative unengaged and unconvincing pity since the author seems tohave a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such asfootball the yankees modern poetry and exposing turkish attempts tobuy \( among others \) princeton professors to act as mouthpieces givinglegitimacy to their vile historical revisionism practiced by the modern turkish state and its organs it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories andfamily testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels the i and we and us occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy theintimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice but is it realy \? since in order to make this legitimate the writer must distance himself at least initially from all this old world exotica and like the reader question their validity or relevance in present day north americansociety what are all these old world old fashioned ghosts and traditions \? is the first cry of writer and reader alike only ofcourse to be followedby a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in placereader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein this culture and this lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of culturalwealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towardsmaterialistic memory free self redefining comfort seeking and buyingmores in the balakian tale one encounters suburbia instead of substance worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities eithertowards surrealism the abstract and unemotional or else towards medicine respectability and detachment young balakian observes but neverunderstands the grandmother for she is shielded culturally from beingable to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instillthe armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find theircrime is self denial and a march to the tune of america 's mixmasterpiper be unlike your past and your future will be brighter seems to bewhat america promises at the very least the intermediate generation listensand adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quiteunderstand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian andto preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos whileenjoying as if to serve sweet irony full course armenian meals and themixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday peter is lost alright but as the book sadly shows he remains lost paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocideexpert make personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities doesnot a genocide history make \( for that read vahakn dadrian 's the historyof the armenian genocide berghahn books 1995 \) episodic accounts can bedismissed by the turks as hear say and as mere isolated incidents leadingto more harm than good \( for if better evidence existed the arguementgoes why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare \? \) for the story to haveworked for the story to have really worked as i would have liked it to balakian 's life and lifestyle would have had to have changedsignificantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflectit and his relationship with his wife who like him is not leading a stronglyarmenian existence would have had to have changed solidifying his roots celebrating his new found identity and nurturing the metamorphosis bysustained community involvment and grass roots movement participationwhich alas never appear on the pages of this book how else to explainthe lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakianis a grand personal witness except that the transition has not occured \? the ship of armenianness sails by balakian he is finally aware enough tobe able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it butnot resolved enough to climb aboard that is how the book fails and that ishow his story fails this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit ofmid stream self awareness thrown in for a real story of an armenianfinding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future read mark arax 's book in my father 's name \( simon schuster 1996 \) where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection isreplaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisitefrankness and power by mark arax one can only hope that balakian 'spartial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence willsomehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningfulattachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer \( notwithstanding his laudible actions as an april 24th armenian genocidecommemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the usacademic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade asunbiased researchers \) this criticism i direct to the predecessor of thisgenre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second i speakhere of passage to ararat by michael arlen \( hungry mind republication 1996 \) where a disinterested soit disant armenian goes to armenia in the70 's and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched bythis strange people 's woes and dreams too little too late and alwaysdetached is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or culturalreorientation much more needs to be absorbed before the essence istransmitted to future generations to take and behold however i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnicidentity survival stories will be written which will show that the tideof assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of thisexperiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent weproudly call our home	18
1	this is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch the last bunch i got wasnt as enjoyable as i was used to i realised it was because it lacked crunch would buy it again though great guilt free snack great for kids too	18
1	i bought this for our grandson age 13 soon to be 14 and he was very pleased with it he did say that it was a little more difficult to put together but he did it and was very pleased with himself and with the results thank you for making this possible the price was right	18
0	these boots were the worst ever ! they were grossly missized and not as depicted the back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering when returned the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving never again	18
1	this is a wonderful item that your cat will love i originally purchased a thermal mat from another website \( more expensive with a pattern that i did n't like \) my 3 cats fought over who would get to sleep on it so i did a search and when i found this one i ordered one for each of them this cat mat has been such a hit with my furfaces and is such a great deal that i just ordered 3 more for my dad sister and a friend to give to their cats i 've seen similar thermal cat mats for 50 the pattern that appears on the super soft side is a dark green with subtle black leopard print and the other side is black faux sheepskin my cats like both sides you can throw them in the washing machine and fur does n't stick to the smooth patterned side which is nice of all of the cat beds i have purchased including a heated window mounted bed that plugged into the wall this mat is my kitties' favorite thing to sleep on	18
1	our son is 2 y o and had a great time with this puzzle enjoy all the animals	18
1	my husband loved the size quality and heavy weight of this product great for the male chef in the family	18
1	this very fascinating book is a story written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary entries made by the principle character of the book it chronicals the life of a young scottish woman forced to live first in china then japan well written and historically accurate it 's obvious the author is intimately familiar with the the culture customs history and life style of japan this makes the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story for all who 've ever lived in japan it 's a believable tale that literally makes you feel you 've stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth of modern japan for those who have n't lived in japan believe that the author has done his homework and is not simply just creating a fictional setting in his mind because of this he 's able to focus on his character versus scene setting development and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind the timespan covers over 40 years as the story weaves through her trials and tribulations and shows how her fortitude and strength serve her through tumultuous events in her life a gripping tale that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for her when the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story would continue but even good books must end be prepared to sit a spell once you start reading you 'll find it hard to put down	18
0	like many overhead gym type toys this one turns out to be for short or legless babies when my daughter kicks the kickplates she kicks the toy right away from her \( and this is on carpet \) and when we brace the toy against something she kicks herself right out from under the toy we have found the same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys now that we have looked at the box more closely the baby in the picture has his her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit under the toy our daughter is 3 1 2 months old and is already too big for this on a positive note this is a very well made toy in all other respects looks durable as are all chicco toys and the music and lights are pleasant another negative you apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to activate sound and lights and most babies want to pull them might be good for a tummy toy but we 're not waiting for that we 'll try the chicco 3 in 1 gym instead as it appears to be a much better bang for the buck and does not have a kick plate	18
0	to call this a bad machette would be to generous it is more accurately described as a machette shaped object as other have noted the blade is thin too flexible easily rusts and fails to hold an edge the handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined if you use it without wearing gloves this tool will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation th sheath material is 1 step above paper technically it will hold the machette on your belt but if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath i ca n't believe a company with a valuable name like coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage	18
0	i never write reviews for anything but this one was so bad i could n't help myself everybody has different tastes but if you like music with any kind of structure or melody at all you will not like belladonna i could not make sense of it at all it rambled on and on never getting to the point never picking a path never building on a theme it bored me with it 's vague attempts to build a song i listened to it 2 times just to make sure i was n't imagining how bad it was and then i dumped it it was not my style and i do n't see how it could be anybody 's style but that 's just me i felt obligated to voice my opinion and possible save somebody out there from being bitterly disappointed good luck on your listing adventures	18
1	i had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses the hugger mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it does n't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip	18
1	these are exactly what i was looking for i 've been wearing this type of ear muff for 20 years everytime i break or lose a pair i spend months looking for its replacement after i received my first pair i ordered enough to last me another 20 years i hate the around your neck ear muffs so popular these days they are uncomfortable and they cost more	18
1	my sister who has 4 kids insisted i buy this and boy was she right ! those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off are n't thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet first of all the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that 's a pain to tie on and off especially when you get it on there just right then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners did i mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion \? ugh i do n't think so i 'd much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have my daughter sit on a soaking sheet \( this pad wicks away the moisutre \) and have to go through so much trouble to change it as far as the imprint on her face i have n't noticed any and she has n't been bothered	18
0	i have moderate knowledge of computers etc and i found this overly complicated this is not intended for the novice however even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money i wish i had not bought it at all perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them save your money this was a waste	18
1	if you have your own small business or start up or are even slightly thinking about starting one this magazine is well worth the small cost i usually bring mine on the plane along with a couple others	18
1	i 've been a corel user since ver 5 or so it 's always been a decent graphics application but ver 12 and now 3x are the best i 've ever seen this program is so intuitive compared to others in this category it s particularly easier than quarkxpress i know quark 's a page layout app but you can do the exact same stuff 95 of the time in corel much better pdf 's and a huge price advantage make this their best version yet indesign is also very good but pure useability gives corel an edge	18
0	the game seemed to start off like any other nancy drew game my daughter has played them all however after a while it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all all the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery however this game took her two days all the other nancy drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more this game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed in fact her words at the end of the game were that 's it \? her interactive better come out with a more interesting game next time or you 'll lose the interest	18
1	i really am pleased with my solar lights they are the right color everything they seem to stay light longer	18
1	i am a huge u2 fan and this is the best concert i have ever seen this concert is simply unbeliveable it proves to all those stupid people that the belief that u2 were only good in the 80s and 90s is a load of garbage u2 's still got it this concert proves it if you do n't think u2 's good anymore go watch this concert all that you ca n't leave behind is a good album maybe not as good as joshua tree and achtung baby but it is still good how to dismantle an atomic bomb left a little to be desired and for the stupid guy at the beginning of these reviews \( i think it was the first one \) what do you mean bono was supporting homosexuality \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? when he kissed edge it was representing the betrayal of jesus christ look up the lyrics to the song that they were singing until the end of the world i took the money i kissed your lips \( face in the concert \) and broke your heart bono represents judas iscariot in the song also if you still do n't believe me and think this is some love song or something watch any u2 concert with this song almost all of them show bono doing a little devil horn thing usually after kissing edge \( christ \) the only thing i agree with in that guy 's review is that edge really is the spirit of the band not bono i love the delay that edge uses in his guitar and i hate how when people think of u2 they think of bono bono 's fine but i love how edge plays anyway go read his review if you want to find out more just do n't listen to that homosexuality crap anyway this concert is awesome and i could just watch it over and over again in fact i'm actually watching it tonight ! great show makes you feel like you 're actually there u2 is a wonderful band with good christian messages in their songs and i ca n't wait for their next album and concert to come out	18
1	i 've been a robben ford fan since 1979 each time he offers a new recording i try to purchase it as quickly as possible robben can rock and play slow blues every cut on this cd is worth listening to over and over again i ca n't say enough ! robben is one of the least known and treasured guitartists of our generation ! if you like robben ford do n't miss chris cain this man is also a guitar genius	18
0	i paid 99 00 for this little camcorder thought it would be ideal for my action sports heros in the house but we could n't get the videos to transfer to the pc the menu button would not bring anything up so overall we just could n't get this thing to work a bummer of a christmas present	18
0	i know that pelican screen protectors and styluses are tempting because they 're always the cheapest ones available that should tell you something first of all the top screen uses adhesive it 's smooth plastic in the middle but the edges will leave sticky goo on the screen because the edge is a different material than the middle it 's insanely difficult to squeeze the air bubbles out of it and being adhesive trying again and again is n't much of an option furthermore the sticky edge is white not clear and it looks horrible on my onyx ds lite after having so much difficulty with the top screen protector i checked online for reviews i read several reports of people who used the pelican styluses with the pelican bottom screen protector and the screen protector being very drastically scratched up within an hour 's worth of use so whether the stylus is too harsh for the bottom screen protector or the screen protector was too flimsy for the stylus the combination just does n't work many people report simply throwing their pelican write and protect sets into the trash so i'm not the only one that paid pelican money for something that 's going into the trash can no matter how inexpensive pelican 's product is it 's still too expensive if you end up throwing it in the trash too i know i'm going to avoid the pelican screen protectors and styluses in the future and i very much wish that there were reviews here on amazon before i bought mine i had to dig through nintendo ds forums to read other peoples' opinions finally if you already bought one and hate it you can remove it by using scotch tape on the edges to peel it off and rubbing alcohol to remove the residue	18
1	this is like hot sauce concentrate you must dilute it to use it do not try to eat this stuff straight or you will be miserable for hours and then some lets just say it burns both ways a teaspoon in an entire crock of chili will make the chili hot enough to be near inedible and i like very hot and spicy foods five or six drops is probably more than enough for an entire dish tabasco is n't even comparable to this because no amount of tabasco would make a dish that hot this is truly the hotest sauce i have ever had i think it killed my tastebuds \( slight sarcasm \) wash your hands thoroughly after use as there will often be residue on the lid if you rub your eyes they will burn for a long time and i would suggest flushing them with water for about 10 minutes if you have the unfortunate experience the first listed ingredient is habaneros	18
0	jane fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful if opinonated \( remember hanoi jane \? \) woman i watched this as a teenager and despite the striptease this has to be one of her worst hormones be damned watching this was a waste of time if you like fonda try klute she was an excellent actress but no one could survive this mess	18
0	i thought my jvc digital camera was handy easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was then one day at my daughter 's ballet show i turned it on \( i made sure i charged it all night \) and it would n't record it kept saying that the lens cap was on i am so frustrated and sad i spent a good chunk of money on this item and do n't know what happened still do n't have a way of recording my daughter 's milestones do n't buy it if you have other options	18
1	nice price point good quality ca n't complain	18

1	after ruining another pair of over the head headphones i decided to check these out they are actually on sale at 50 off and i 've just tried mine out the audio is very sharp especially with the base though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair i can just increase the volume to compensate at 35 this is a great deal they feel great the band that most headphones have presses down on your head but not too much it also folds down quite nicely though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress have n't tried out the actual noise cancellation feature but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent then it will work just as well it also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your mp3 player if you so wished however it easily fits into a jacket pocket great great great design and comfort	18
1	i love this bracelet it 's very pretty looks just like it was shown looks expensive tasteful i have bigger wrists so i 'd like it better if it came in larger sizes but it goes great with my watch	18
1	every time i wear this tie it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were and when cartoons were cartoons also working in a place with a lot of kids they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on i 've had this tie for 3 years now high quality and does not stain really easy \( at least for me great quality \) only downfall a little dated with a 32 cent stamp kids do n't notice and neither do most adults worth picking up great price	18
1	i bought this for my sister for christmas i have a similar one that is bigger that i bought while in charleston sc she fell in love with mine and since driving 4 hours just to buy a necklace was out of the question i decided on this one at first when it arrived i thought it would be too small but my sister does not wear large neclaces earrings etc turns out she loved it it was just perfect for her especially since her neck is thin and her complexion is olive	18

1	i 've bought this toy for my daugther \( she 's 6 \) and she loves it it 's a good toy to use alone to share with friends or even with her parents \( myself \) it 's a good option to the computer she also carries this toy with her stuff when she goes outside	18

1	i get compliments every time i wear this i took a chance because i tend to be a bit plump as other reviewers noted the sleeves do run snug but otherwise it 's a great jacket at a great price the grommets are just so fun it is fully lined i just love this modern addition and it 's not too young feeling just right	18
0	i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service \( communication and such \) have been very good i purchased this bracelet a few months ago and \( a few days ago \) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer i was taking it off and it snapped in the middle once you could see the insides it was obviously not pure sterling silver as the materials portion indicates i will be returning this item for a new one \( already gave my girl a matching one \) and may not even wear it at all very disappointing	18
1	good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device my major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and i would not use it it is just right and great protection for my 1955 by the way i replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen it is a great piece of protection	18
0	i do n't think so contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script think about it take a dump on a stock and get wiped out now you are a messenger \? i do not think so i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades but this is crazy thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum yes he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote	18
1	got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she played with well more like laid and stared at now she 's 4 1 2 months old and she still loves it she loves to grab at the fish shake the rattle and twirl the lobster for awhile it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom music is n't too annoying either	18
0	our 3 year old son just loves hot wheels cars this transporter however is not one of his favorites it 's easy to see why the back is difficult to lower with it being controlled by a very small button on the bottom of the trailer who ever thought of this design for a child \? it 's also very easy for the child to accidentally get his fingers caught in the trailer when lowering it the cones and barrels are easily lost and the storage of them in the trailer is badly designed they have a small piece of plastic that locks in the barrels or cones which is impossible for a child to figure out i 'd recommend passing on this toy if you have a child in the 3 5 year old range	18
1	this candle is the ultimate pleasure ! it 's smell is not over powering but is pleasurable at the same time you will be sure to love it as much as i do !	18
1	this movie will make you laugh and cry with a who 's who of hollywood the music alone will move you to the kleenex box if you have lost someone to aids this movie will touch you deeply i was told not to watch this movie alone watch it with someone to hug how right they were bronson pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have eric roberts and gregory harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples i know bravo ! get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect	18

0	the review by bovey is spot on ! these games have gotten more boring as they go the majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough \? there was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom ! and the game was so short suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed in what these games have become i loved the final scene i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough this game was just lame i do n't recommend paying full price for it	18
1	i have dry unmanagable curly hair and rehab has done wonders for it ! because all the lush shampoos do n't contain any silicones it takes about one or two weeks for your hair to get used to it the squeeky feeling described in the other review is because of the lack of silicones this feeling disappears however when your hair dries up since i use rehab my hair is bouncy soft and shiny especially great in combination with american cream conditoner \( just love that scent !	18
0	i bought this chair because of the great reviews i hesitated at spending so much but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years pros i like that i can roll it around to the table or to the sink to clean up after meals the height adjustment is easy and convenient the cons folding it up did n't quite work as i thought it would it did n't lock into the folding postition and did n't really save that much space i would prop it against the wall and hope that no one knocked it down we finally stopped folding it up the toys that connect to the tray were too dangerous for my son as he would usually hit himself in the face with them when he was younger by the time he was older i did n't really need them the battery operated toy has a funny smell to it whenever it 's been running for a while he did like it but the buttons were too hard for him to press when he was younger my son discovered at 7 months how to pull off the extra tray that can go into the dishwasher so we do n't use that he 's 13 months now and last week discovered how to disconnect the tray itself and fling it off of the high chair i washed the seat cover per the instructions and half the time did not use the dryer even though it said it could go into the dryer and now the seat is bubling and cracking i have to place a cloth diaper in the seat to protect my son 's legs if i had not spent 90 00 on the chair i would not be as disappointed but he 's only used it for 7 months	18
1	this is just a plain sweetheart of a lens it covers the useful 18 35 mm range \( which is 27 52mm on a nikon digital slr which is a very useful range \) this lens costs less than half the price of the \( expensive \) professional nikon 17 35 and does almost as nice a job sufficiently nice in fact that most amateurs will not discern much if any difference while not built like a tank i think that the quality of construction on this one is excellent and more than adequate for enthusiastic amateurs and even some pros on a nikon digital slr which will use the center portion of this lens \( due to the size of the sensor in the slr \) you can expect excellent even spectacular results this is a fabulous lens for landscape and nature shots portraits or just plain walking around taking pictures someone who only wanted one lens that was not a telephoto could do much worse than to select this excellent versatile lens this one is great for parties vacations and the works the images i have shot with this lens have all featured superb contrast are very sharp and have beautiful color rendition there just is not a lot not to like about this lens i give it 4 stars for overall performance but 5 stars for value and price performance some lenses just get it all together and work and become keepers this is one of those	18

0	i also had a problem with the coating flaking off within the first week of using it the only reason i still use it is because i'm a poor college student that got it as a gift in the first place and ca n't afford a new one after scrubbing the inside bottom of the wok furiously i managed to get all the flakes off and then some the lid is made of thin aluminum and has bent almost completely out of shape awful product do not buy this wok	18
0	can you say p a i n \? this is what steve madden shoes are pain the soles must be made of cast iron the upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough i am convinced that this madden person hates women if it were in my power i would track down steve madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs only standing walking and dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain	18

1	while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times the genius of david bowie shines through as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust it was an amazing look at the time period the sound quality is suprisingly good although some camera angles are distracting at times it was also neat to hear bowie 's pronouncement of this is our last tour ever little did he know this dvd is worth every penny rock on	18
1	if you liked the original then you will also like kh2 it finishes the story nicely battle commands are improved i especially like the reaction commands still has some camera issues overall a good game	18
1	i have recently had my fifth child and so i have experienced many baby items including swings and this one is the best ! it has a cushiony comfy seat for baby with different recline options soothing lights and mobile for baby to have something to look at several musical tunes with adjustable volume control there is also a dial to set the swing motion to go slowly or faster and the best feature of all is that this cradle swing can be changed to swing side to side or front to back sometimes we put our baby in swinging front to back and she 'll cry we then change the swing position to go side to side and she immediately stops crying and starts to fall asleep and vice versa sometimes we put her in side to side and she wants to swing front to back how great to have that option so she can swing whatever way she 's in the mood for ! as my husband says this is the best money we 've ever spent !	18

1	i was looking for something very simple for my little boy and had a lots of troubles most of the potties i looked at were constructed in a manner of a throne or a spaceship and i didn`t want anything like that this potty is very simple and easy to wash and doesn`t have no distracting blings just what the doctor prescribed	18
0	people who complain that the aerosol can is empty the next day should listen closely to the product the one i ordered will leak as long as the mechanism is attached to the aerosol can i have tried reconnecting it many times using different pressure as i push down but to no avail at 10 dollars a night this product will get very expensive very quickly if it had worked without the leak i would have given ssscat 5 stars	18
0	i did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the serial port on a computer since most new computers use usb for serial interface the usefulness of this unit is limited my two newly purchased hp computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product i would not have bought it had i known this i have not used the gps since i bought it it will probably be tossed out the serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package so you do n't see it prior to opening the package once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs i have seen the plastic clamshell is so hard to open that i think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors the cut plastic is also dangerous	18
1	this is a pretty good flavor it is n't my all time favorite \( apricot \) but way up there	18
1	much of the plot has been outlined above as well as the cast and i am in large part in complete agreement with the positive reveiws recorded i want to add that for anyone raised on the old universal horror pictures or the films directed by james whale or val lewton where the suspense is the important part of the film this picture shadows and fog has this quality absolutely dripping from every frame ! despite the comedic elements \( and there are many funny things happening \) the tension rises perceptibly throughout the narrative the climax is dissapointing for many but if you follow the subtext of this extremely philosophical script it is nearly a perfect resolution in all ways i have had philosophy students who were struggling with concepts of 19th and 20th century writers watch this movie and instantly gain insight into the point of the often times obtuse oblique writings of hegel kant and the like i beleive that the unpopularity of the this film is based on people thinking that they were about to see bananas or sleeper love him or hate him you have to admit woody allen is deep a personal favorite film of mine but definetly not everybodies cup of philosophicallly comedic tea	18
0	is n't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem to which you say quot yeah ! yeah ! that 's me ! quot and then gives you no answer or a weak one to which you say quot no duh ! quot i'm afraid this book is one of them the title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you 've only dreamed of or at least point you in the right direction to get started ! but i was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that god gives us desires that we ca n't have on earth so that we will long for him and heaven i do n't believe that 's the abundant life jesus promised so i went to the bible \( i should have gone there first ! \) i looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer quot delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart ! quot ps 37 4 so i set out to seek him i started reading quot knowing god quot by j i packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire ! i hope you 'll find them too in him	18
1	this book is simply incredible a more stimulating book i could n't imagine ! it 's not that it told me so much i did n't know intuitively but seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home this is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically the world has changed neal gabler tells it like he sees it and has a lot of research to back up his views i love that he does n't make judgements or try to press an opinion on the reader it 's left up to you to decide how you feel about it all i find myself thinking of points he brought up throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in quot real quot life the only reason i did n't give it a 5 is because i wish it was a bit more in depth it 's so engaging that i can imagine an entire college course being made from this book it is a book that 's as entertaining as it is informative and that 's the whole point	18

0	i honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms 4 came out it actually now has a use let me explain unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing \( the company that translated wild arms 4 \) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you 'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this if it was n't for this reason i would n't even be interested in this product	18

0	from a sociological perspective hustlers beats and others serves what it set out to do explore the sociological aspects of billiards in america and the culture that has accompained it through time however with the recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society many of his observations and conclusions are dated if not false te book just goes to many places crime pornography etc and fails what it set out to originally acomplish furthermore i find it quite unusal that the author chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards is this not a sociological perspective or an historical editorial as a college student and a sociology major the author fails to win my support from his argument all in all quite disapointing as i found it at my local bookstore and the cover looked interesting i was left with a feeling of disappointment when i finished this book as it completely crushed many of the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture of billiards stick with the sociology cut the editoria	18

0	i did n't have especailly high hopes for this book i think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of hh books over the years and this one brings it to a new low basically it 's waaaaaay too long at 850 pages it 's a monster read and a slow one that 's not always a bad thing sometimes if you like the characters it 's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page but not here why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language \? for several paragraphs \? more than once \? why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services \? i think i 'd be in a very small minority when i confess that i quite like the 1662 prayer book though i ca n't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it 's been out of use here for decades ! maybe it was easy to cut and paste and got the word count up and then there 's the space combat a strength of the series especially the first three or four but there 's the rub there are only so many ways you can describe a spaceship blowing up by the 11th book in the series i ca n't be the only person out there whose eyes are beginning to glaze over when we get to the battle sequences but the big problem spoiler alert ! is the way in which weber solves the love triangle we left the last book with honor loves hamish emily loves hamish hamish loves honor and emily what to do \? it turns out that there 's an easy solution after about 400 pages of agonising \( not to mention most of the previous book \) it seems that honor can marry them both a bit outre \? seemingly not apparently such arrangements fall well within the accepted norms of manticoran law and custom \( although we 've never had a whiff of this before \) but what really gets me is that the reason it did n't happen about halfway through the last book is that \( get this \) gosh no one thought of it it seems that no one ever told mr weber that if you shoot someone with a gun in act v the gun better have been hanging on the wall in act i all in all i can only say please mr weber it is time to bring the series to an end please do it soon	18
0	there 's a reason oar flopped when it was released back in 1969 it sucks thirty eight years later with skip spence safely in his grave some now give this pitiful mess five stars since you ca n't give more than five stars here they 're saying oar is on a level with masterpieces like sergeant pepper dark side of the moon led zeppelin 4 ! just between you and me i think the government is still secretly drugging people with all due respect to skip 's venerable memory oar is a painful aural experience the first two tracks little hands and cripple creek are halfway good and show some production values but things quickly deteriorate from there one gets the impression the rest of oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping then put in the can after only one or two takes lastly the bass playing and drumming are just awful yes it 's too bad that things ended up like they did for skip and it 's hard not to sympathize with him he flew high only to crash hard but let 's keep a sense of perspective his tragedy did not translate into good music one extra star in his memory	18
0	this a mystery triller starring tom berenger gretta scacchi corbin bernsen joanne whalley kilmer and bob hoskins it 's the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically crashing all the way she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm while he amazingly lives at first leaving him in a coma but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia later after being nursed back to health and falling in love with his wife all over again he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller but comes predictable fast i knew the key 'mysteries' almost immediately and i'm sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law order episodes will agree eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again	18

0	my nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture unfortunately the inflatable suit is not really inflatable it requires constant air to keep it poofy looking it is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower \( battery operated \) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated the battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit everytime he moves it pops out the fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him he loves superman and loves having a cape he opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with i suppose we got what we paid for cheap prices does n't equate to quality i felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy would not recommend it to anyone else unfortunately	19
0	this product is a huge waste of time it loaded easily enough looks friendly and is feature rich but it just does n't work ! and support is awful biggest problem is it just would make a good back up image burned many dvd 's and the program kept telling me the files were corrupted in most cases i coul n't even get confirmation of that the program did something to my dvd drive it would ask me to swap a spanned set yet disable my drive ! process had to be cancelled whole system rebooted just to get access to my dvd drive again when i tried manually checking the files they would n't open explore or mounting the images kept requiring a password but i do n't use passwords ! made sure the settings were all password free stick with norton ghost ! ! ! ! !	19

1	i subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to woodworkers journal since 1990 each magazine has a character of it 's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents this magazine is a bit more complex than say wood magazine it should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified i have one of woodworking journal 's projects in my living room it is perhaps the most beautiful piece i have ever made if you have become an advanced amature \( sp \? \) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others	19

1	all of the isleys early work without the younger isleys is just as good with them but these early workouts are more raw stripped down and pop oriented ron isley has a way of making country and rock remakes sound like they were never before recorded not too many black artists can do that to get a taste of the quot real isleys quot before the quot mr biggs quot persona get this with quot get into something quot and quot givin' it back quot	19
0	man this game sucks i love snl but the questions here are so trivial i was looking forward to getting this for christmas and was very excited when i opened it it all went downhill from there i think the pieces are a good idea but they 're ugly the dvd clues are dumb and ineffective i was playing with my dad \( who is legally blind \) he could n't read the questions on the tv i think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated overall the game sucked the questions were silly and it was n't fun at all ! as an aside i noticed that there are no african americans on the box or the board one could argue that eddie murphy or chris rock were more successful snl stars than say cheri oteri whatever game sucks costs too much stay away	19
0	after reading a fine balance i could n't wait to read another book by this author i then read his third book called family matters which was good but i was disappointed as it by no means compared to a fine balance i just finished such a long journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots it is my least favorite of the three books by this author it 's hard to believe that someone can right a book like a fine balance which was magnificant and one of the best books i have ever read and then turn our stuff that is at best average	19

0	it 's disturbing to see how many mistakes i found just browsing through this colorful attractive book though the state bird of alabama is known locally as yellowhammer you will not find that name in any field guide ! the accompanying picture was no help either in identifying what turned out to be the common flicker other state birds were listed by uncommon incorrect misleading names too the 1995 bombing in oklahoma city is represented by a nice picture and writeup but with a glaring misspelling in its headline in memorium should be in memoriam claremore ok is misspelled as clarmore on the map these errors leaped out at me just flipping through the pages this is very disappointing and makes me wonder what other misinformation this book contains adults have some knowledge and experience against which to measure what they read schoolchildren who may be learning facts for the first time need the facts to be correct	19
0	i had a suunto for 10 months the face scratched very easily which was disappointing however the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that i could stand up in the watch filled with water and died on returning to suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! they say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m i would never buy another suunto product whatsmore the shop i bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either it is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all	19

0	i'm sure that this review is n't unique spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover not to mention the ridiculous articles written within by the time they get done describing the 'euro punk indie pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound' i 've completely forgotten the point of thier article they must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing they sound like cyber nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv com i'm sure that i 've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin next time you see it on the stands i suggest you spin in another direction	19

1	if you decide to buy a current greeting card program there are really only two front line choices art explosion greeting card factory \( currently version 5 \) or hallmark card studio \( currently 2006 \) there are other programs available specifically for creating cards but most of them are low quality and outdated and are n't really worth considering \( a competitive third product featuring american greetings designs is sadly now long outdated the designs in the american greetings program were of similar quality to those in the hallmark package \) so how do these two products match up \? without a question if you are looking for quality canned cards the hallmark program wins the hallmark designs are professional and are equal in quality to cards you would purchase in a store in contrast the designs in art explosion are adequate but surely not up to the quality of a store bought card the hallmark program is also able to simply and correctly print to several different types of card store \( although you are stuck with the choices pre programmed into the software unless you want much frustration \) the art explosion does a poorer job of correctly and simply printing to a variety of card stock and configurations art explosion beats the hallmark program in editing options \( more extensive \) and in the amount of additional art \( clipart etc \) included with the package if you do not plan to use the canned cards then i would recommend art explosion but the average user will likely appreciate the professional high quality cards in the hallmark package personally i consider the choice of the hallmark package over art explosion a no brainer a note on versions the publisher comes out with a new version of the hallmark program every year \( 2003 2004 2005 2006 etc \) and the same is true for art explosion greeting card factory having used many of these versions i find very little reason to recommend upgrading year by year disappointingly the stock cards in the hallmark program do not seem to have changed appreciably in many years and the same is true for art explosion	19

0	this book is terribly organized i'm not sure what happened in writing this book but it seems clear that professor jones did not compile this in the chronological order that it is printed in my main complaint is that rather obscure concepts people events are repeatedly referred to and then only later does jones bother to define them \( i would almost prefer that he not define something at all rather than offering a definition 100 pages after his first reference to it ! \) the fact that the book has an index only further infuriated me clearly the author publisher knew where all these terms were located throughout the book yet did not bother to offer a definition in the appropriate first reference to the concept examples are numerous but here are a few robe nobility referenced on pages 139 152 183 defined \? \( pg 183 \) sans culottes first referenced on page 189 defined on page 231 louis sebastien mercier referenced on pages 11 138 178 189 200 204 212 213 when did jones provide information \( that he was a journalist dramatist and observer of parisian mores \) on just who mercier is \? page 215 aside from that there are some plain old errors one such is in the text box on saint genevieve jones mentions that she negotiated with frankish military chieftains in the 570s and 580s she died in 512ad so the negotiations seem improbable \( 470s 480s would be correct but i should not have to figure that out \) the redeeming quality of the book is that if does offer information on paris if you are willing to sift through the above mentioned annoyances and paris is not such a bad subject	19

0	i myself is a proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services i also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase \( mine in three months \) the strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself \( in one occasion they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it 's good \) these back and forth guessing games normally drag on for months and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you even though it 's still within one year i believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying this is our policy	19
1	this is a great choice for a business casual style watch with it 's crystal clear face and smooth shape it complements most business attire nicely the adjustment button does n't get pulled easily so there is less chance of accidental time loss after several weeks of wear still no scratches on the watchface and the metal remains untarnished i still get questions about it definitely an eye catcher	19
1	i 've owned the p 73 for about two years now one thing i'm noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews is that after a year or so the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely for me this has n't happened with this camera it 's always been great and it has a lot of really convenient features when i bought this camera i knew nothing about cameras i just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was pretty i got really lucky i mean i only bought it because it was pretty i knew nothing about it but nonetheless i got lucky and bought this camera that takes aa batteries came with a battery charger and its own usb cord it had a ton of settings on it now that i understand more about photography i really like the manual setting the slowest shutter speed is 30 seconds compared to 10 15 seconds of even newer cameras in its class like i said i never had any problems with it batteries always lasted long took little time to recharge i never even bought a memory card for this camera i use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that 's all the given memory card can hold and my pictures are still decent quality i'm now looking into a new camera because i do want excellent image quality and ironically ever since i 've been shopping for a new digital camera my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about 20 percent of the shots i take weird anyway if you 're looking to buy a sony digital camera based on my experience with this one i 'd recommend the brand	19
1	we used this for my newborn daughter up until 3 months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently as a previous reviewer stated sometimes it works sometimes not so i combined it with the recommended dosage for infant gas drops and that would do the trick i found little tummy 's brand at babies r us which is less expensive and is the same thing later after 6 months and trying new foods there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something did n't agree with her i gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she 'd clearly feel better	19
0	yeah i know it 's the industry standard and it 's powerful and all that stuff but my god what a freaking pain to use it 's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch while the interface in cs2 is an improvement doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should frankly i could draw better stuff faster with 1990 's era macintosh drawing programs the drawing issues are compounded by the fact that in true adobe spirit this program is incredibly bloated and slow it 's slow doing everything i 've never seen a program so slow starting up and every time you save a file \( even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes \) you get a saving file progress bar for a few seconds it 's also incredibly slow to shut down frequently taking about 30 seconds i'm running it on a pentium m laptop and i know this is not a graphics professional machine but come on ! let 's get the lead out ! i just get the sense that adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed that bugs me a lot	19
1	i bought this for my new hdv fx1 camcorder and it works great unlike the century wide angle lens this is fully zoom through lens is 8x which is less than the century and others but just about right for hd since the fx1 already can do a pretty decent wide shot when the zoom is fully backed out this just gives it an extra boost converting the camera view from roughly a 35mm lens on a 35mm camera to about a 28mm also very little barrel distortion in all a great lens only drawback is that it 's a big \( heavy \) lens but then hey it 's for a serious prosumer camcorder	19

0	one of the spotlight reviewers says that by combining two great characters sunny randall and jesse stone robert b parker has doubled our fun quite the reverse he has cut it in half the characterizations of sunny and jesse are enormously feeble and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes either sunny 's irish mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout suitcase simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more the villains buddy erin missy gerard moon are little more than vague names and stereotyping spike is relegated to a scene and a half oddly the only interesting character is a very minor one eddie but he only stays around for 10 minuteseven the plot is tissue thin the love story is lame the sex scenes boring worst of all who should appear but \( christ ! \) susan silverman from the spenser series one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction as with cold service and some others parker is just coasting with this one he is capable of far better	19

1	nice watch that keeps super accurate time however it is very basic showing only the time and date it would be nice if it had backlighting but the hands do glow in the dark for some period of time it is a little tricky to pick up the time signal so i would recommend finding a place in your home where the signal is strong and leave it there every night	19

1	this is such an good industrial album that i was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that i wanted to use seemed not good enough however if i have to put one then it has to be these brilliant astounding stupendous and awesome this is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time the first track is good and then it just gets better and better in fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track the book let is ok but the lyrics are missing but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing minphaser life line guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds bets and samples the keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music	19

1	to be honest i was a little wary of disgaea 2 the first game was so much fun and i was a bit worried that the sequel would just suck worry not fair gamers for disgaea 2 takes most \( though not all \) of what 's good about the first game and builds upon it incredibly humourous localization \? check colorful anime styled artwork \? check detailed amusing and slightly outdated 2d sprites \? check highly amusing and strangely moving storyline \? check etna \? check the dark assembly \( new and improved so it 's much more enjoyable \) \? check my only quibble is that they stripped out a lot of the unlockable classes which takes a little bit of the fun out of obsessively levelling your characters however as you can tell from my rating that is only a quibble and it 's totally balanced out by all the other improvements that they made overall if you enjoyed the first game you 'll enjoy this one just as much i'm so very thankful that this did not suffer from sequel itis	19

1	we just got this bike for my 4 1 2 year old it is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride he is 45 inches tall and has about 1 5 inches clearance over the center bar on the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter but i do n't see how it is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it overall the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking a back pedal and hand brake the styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage i would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful the enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and i was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions putting it together is somewhat intuitive and i did figure it out but better directions would have been much appreciated	19

1	i had similar difficulties with this hi def adapter for one thing the plugs were nearly impossible to get into the sockets and once i did get them on all i got was a black screen but thanks to a friend i figured out what the problem was if you 're having trouble getting those monster cables attached \( and who has n't \? \) you should get a deoxit progold kit by caig it 's just two very small cans of stuff that help clean off your connectors and more importantly act as a temporary lubricant i got my kit at radio shack i think it was about twelve bucks as for not getting any picture at all that was my fault i did n't realize that two of the sets of inputs on my tv are for 1080i only once i moved the plugs to the proper jacks and turned off the signals that did not apply in my xbox dashboard the picture was sharp and bright the cables are good quality my only problem with them is that proprietary digital audio connector it 's kind of lame of monster to require you to buy their special optical cable that comes with the right adapter other than that if you 've got the cash get these cables and that caig kit	19

0	i bought this camera after using a sony minidv \( very small one \) camera over 8 years the image quality of sanyo is horrible compared to my old sony under any condition daylight night etc however price size and easy operation makes this camera a winner as you can have it with you all the time so if you want to use this camera as a second camera for everyday use go for it but this is not a serious replacement to a high end camcorder	19
1	kit and holly are presented in this story by terrence malick as total innocents living in a prelapsarian state completely unaware of right and wrong good and evil and ignorant of guilt or sin they have minimal conception of the consequences of their actions in effect they appear almost totally to lack imagination or foresight and can barely empathise with each other let alone other people things just happen as holly sees it kit does n't feel hostility to the people he kills they are merely in his way there is no remorse he is only marginally conscious that the structured world outside his own will eventually catch up with him these kids are like adam and eve with a limited knowledge of what is forbidden but no real knowledge of the meaning of life and death holly throws out her sick catfish showing no feeling her dog is shot as a punishment by her father indicating he too is careless of death or pain kit stands on a dead cow as though puzzled by its absence of life neither of the two seems to cry or laugh much in one way these characters might also be thought of as throwbacks to a prehistoric animalistic past where the younger man simply eliminates the older in order to secure a mate for himself just the way of nature and beyond criticism apparently so i 've read somewhere this is the mindset of the criminal who cannot see what he is doing wrong he has to get by somehow and takes the easiest path why work when you can steal \? if obstacles arise eliminate them people are ok otherwise live now die later this is an extraordinary film superbly acted	19
0	amazon was great about shipping this product but i eventually returned it due to several problems they were also great about the return they paid the return shipping and i got a full refund i never tried any recordings with this card using the media center software that is part of windows mce i was using it with snapstream beyondtv 4 1 if you record using anything but the best \( dvd 720x480 \) quality level it would crop out part of the picture this is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue the latest hauppauge driver did not solve the problem the other problem i had is that several times when i was recording two programs at the same time one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it i do n't know if this was a problem with the card or beyondtv but i think it 's probably due to the card i do n't know if i had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards i also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured i have hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other pcs and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card after reading some reviews it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also \( and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card \) beyondtv works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above but i also only have one tuner card in the pcs that i use these cards in so i ca n't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using beyondtv i returned the 500 card and i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards thus far i'm not having any of the issues with them in beyondtv that i was having with the hauppauge 500 card i can record at a lower quality level with no cropping and i 've had no audio issues so far the quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card \( although maybe not as good as that captured by the hauppauge 250 and 350 cards \)	19

1	we have an original hatteras rope hammack which we purchased when we lived in north carolina i love it but the rope tends to stretch too much and requires rehanging to tighten it we were informed that it would when we purchased it four years ago but now it seems to be more work than it is worth the solid quilted design seems like it would be better and would require less maintenance also our poodle mix pet just loves it she would try to jump in before we could even get it hanged we had to attach a cover to it to keep her paws from going through the ropes so that adds to the value of the solid design thanks for listening to me and we plan on purchasing the guilted hammack as soon as possible	19
1	i never adjusted a watch band before and i thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools this tool could not have made it any easier i did n't break any pins and i adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease you will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band i adjusted an accutron lady 's york and a swiss army men 's maverick i used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly the accutron used solid pins and the swiss army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head	19
1	we bought this clock to use indoors living in florida our power service is n't always reliable especially during hurricane season so having a battery operated atomic clock is perfect for us ! when folks visit they always comment on how nice the clock looks the bronze finish is muted and it does n't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures and for 45 and no shipping we could n't beat the price on ebay overstock com or any onther online companies in other words we 're very pleased with our purchase	19

0	i had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the infantastic dvds from amazon i waited over two months kept getting reassured that they were still coming and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme but amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7 11 days which is at best a misrepresentation and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they ca n't provide the product at all at this point i do n't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted	19

1	i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when mr arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times due to my obsession and after watching it more than 25 times i 've come to appreciate it more great cast sam neil is my favorite richard attenborough is a little too cute and nice but i liked his white clothing the hat and the amber cane wayne knight was incredible as nedry the slob he 's as likeable as ever though somewhat the villain i always hate it when he dies jeff goldblum fit the description of ian malcom from crichton 's novel well crichton sparked my interest in chaos theory sometimes called the butterfly effect i am a firm believer in it and of course in the novel and film malcolm was right life finds a way \( in chaos theory the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions and random unpredictable events result from the normal equation setup because there is never a fixed set of outcomes the system is unpredictable because of its complexity hammond thought his system was without error that he was in complete control he believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female but he was wrong the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian dna that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur dna this dna gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce survive in a single sex environment and it turned out that hammond was wrong about many other equations things are not as black and white as he thought and it is problematic to predict long term behavior of his animals \) love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet we watched the mr dna segment in a high school biology class i 've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated \( though i found mr hammond 's live speaking lines to be unrealistic was he really planning to be there for each tour \? \) the kids were kind of annoying i did n't notice this until i was a little older but lex \( i prefer to be called a hacker \) uses silicon graphics' 3d file system navigator to turn power back on in the park their logo is on the monitor if only unix were as popular as windows is now anyway the soundtrack was classic it was the first cd i bought back in the mid 90s tonya harding skated to the theme at the 1994 olympics or some other competition i only liked her because of her excellent music choice	19

1	this is a film like none other you have ever seen and as such you 'll either love it or hate it from the reviews posted on amazon i 've come to the conclusion that the people who hate it are simply people who do n't have the intelligence to have understood a word of it this film is not literal learn to think about what you are watching to interpret archetypes symbolism and metaphor a clue the lady character is named story now why might that be \? and why would she require a vessel before taking flight into the world \? and what precisely does the wolf like scrunt represent \? and why are there three of those monkeys \? this film is a love letter from one creative person to all other creatives in the world if you are n't an artist you probably wo n't get it at all and might even post a scathing review of it on sites such as this but that achieves nothing but illustrate how stupid you truly are to the artistic souls that will understand everything this film says and love every beautiful unique and visionary second of it magical	19

1	apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new s5 series of miele vacuum cleaners the features price and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models nor even across series many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones they have fancy names like capricorn red velvet and champagne leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car if your browser has tabbed browsing \( e g firefox \) the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to miele 's website and open a tab for each model you 're interested in flip back and forth to see what text changes callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series \( newest technology motor \? \) that still comes with an electronically powered brush \( the 4th pisces model is turbo \) after 3 months of extensive use pros agility the 10 wide seb217 3 electric powerbrush comes standard and one of the reasons i chose this model for me smaller is better while other vacuums advertise large 13 power brushes to cover more area in a single swipe i do n't have much open carpet space coffee tables chairs weight benches and computers all need vacuuming around and under the powerbrush swivels well to get around corners brush duster the most commonly used attachment \( for me \) the brush duster is also small \( slightly larger in diameter than the hose \) and the bristles are durable it 's angled by default but even this plastic piece swivels to straighten out this is not mentioned anywhere you just have to figure this out for yourself on low power i was able to vacuum places that never got vacuumed before like over the spider web of computer cables and telephone wires i even vacuumed the telephone itself and other dust collecting objects on my desk parquet floor brush initially i wondered why miele would include this accessory when the powerbrush was included but this wider brush duster actually does a better job on hard tiled floors than the powerbrush the powerbrush seems more designed to churn up stuff from carpets but the paraquet brush gathers and collects dust stuck to hard surfaces better on the negative side you might have to vacuum the brush itself to unstuck the dust and i wondered why they had to inconvenience the horse for genuine horse bristles there is no permanent storage on the vacuum cleaner for the parquet brush so you have to figure out how to ensure the parts do n't get separated for life \( the powerbrush takes precedence \) cord rewind the mechanical rewind sucked in the entire length of cord every single time something like 15 for 15 times ! \( the manual says to pull out the entire length of cord before use to help dissipate heat \) cons price after all it 's just a vacuum cleaner there also seems to be price fixing in the newer s5 series at least when i bought this everywhere i checked \( maybe 10 websites \) the price was exactly 799 or 799 95 with the only difference being no tax and or free shipping one website even advertised the lowest price allowed ! what 's a diamond dealer \? is this amway \? release buttons the release buttons on the attachments and hose are counterintuitive being on the part that comes off rather than on the part that stays behind therefore you must squeeze the button with the same hand you are pulling away with the hose extension button is particularly confusing it 's an oval shaped rocker button that rocks very little to extend the stainless steel hose you have to remember which side of the button \( top or bottom \) to press there is no distinction on which side to press and it 's always a matter of trial and error as i yank and tug at the hose while pressing top and bottom of the extension button stiff no swivel hose the hose rotates at the top \( handle area \) but does not swivel at the base where it connects to the machine instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to get rid of twists i 'd rather pick up the powerhead and spin it around to get out the twists the flex hose diameter is larger than i'm used to making the hose stiffer and difficult to store in the same closet where i used to store my old vacuum cleaner considering the price an electrical slip ring would have been nice bag full indicator the mechanical bag full indicator is actually an indicator of how much the vacuum cleaner is straining to suck put your hand over the end to block suction and it will indicate bag full right out of the box on short carpet it indicated bag full on high power as i turned the power down it indicated less full sequentially you have to read the instructions about using the floor tool with the tool slightly off the floor to get an accurate reading from the indicator even at that there are caveats about fine dust or pet hair that can fool the indicator extra stuff \? the parquet brush comes attached with a short plastic extension that was difficult to plug directly into the stainless steel hose \( button does n't easily click into place \) the extension is n't needed to connect the parquet brush so you have to remove it and keep track of where you put it to this day i still have n't figured out what the extension is for other than to connect other attachments that i might buy in the future this is yet another piece with no place to store on the vacuum cleaner that i must ensure does not get separated for life \( along with the parquet brush normal filter cage and replacement bags \) symbol marking the power symbol markings are not obvious at all contrary to claims other than the symbols labels min and max you have to read the instructions to figure out what the other power symbols mean at least the power seems to increase sequentially as you turn the dial clockwise the quite mode is 4 of 6 settings \( with 6 being the highest \) and is therefore not actually the quietest but intended to be the normal operating mode i think most people will consider max the default mode optional filter frame this model comes with a hepa filter so you do n't need the filter frame unless you 're going to switch to the normal filters but brand new right out of the box the frame for the normal filters came with a broken cheap plastic handle apparently due to the way it was shipped with the handle protruding out the cardboard wrapping you do n't even need the handle for the frame to function properly but for the kind of money i paid nothing should be broken out of the box the vendor that i bought it from \( best vacuum \) replaced it for free so is it worth 800 \? it does a good job but only time will tell	19

1	as a band the byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history adding to that legacy mr tamborine man 's status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question this band could do it all country folk rock jam psychedelica etc etc and this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements though they would venture into much more adventurous territory \( notorious byrd brothers \) this was where the band was the most solid the most tight collectively dylan 's influence is everywhere from the get go 4 of his songs span the album including the title track which the byrd 's turned into his only 1 hit elsewhere there are two other covers but the songs with the best longevity are originals mostly penned by gene clark witness the tortured romance of i 'll feel a whole lot better and here without you and tell me he was n't a great songwriter roger mcguinn \( or jim if you like \) was quick about finding his signature nasally croon that would go on to influence tom petty among others obviously not everyone had found their place songs by chris hillman and david crosby are nowhere to be found but mr tamborine man stand today every bit as tall as the early works of dylan and the beatles this is the album that set the standard for folk rock from then on from buffalo springfield to rem to toad the wet sprocket to the most current emo bands overall 10 out of 10	19

1	this film is a must see for any dancer the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be for ballet dancers there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a must own selection for any dancer	19

0	the graphics are clear but they are bad ! horses look nothing like that and it is really gross ! i would say get it for the younger kids because they wo n't care there is nothing to do with the game except earn money build your hotel and keep your horse from getting sick you do n't get to ride that often because it said you have ridden enough for this round and it is very enoying you ca n't pay enough monay to keep more than one horse but you need to jump them to earn money so you can build your hotel parking lot jumping corse breeding paddock ect but you ca n't do that unless you can jump the horse alot and you ca n't it is easy to go 'bankrupt' so i would say this game is not for little kids because of the money dealing not for older kids because of the dumbness of the horses look not for younger kids because of the money problems so do n't get this game	19
1	i am one of the people who just does n't like applying liquid foundation and cannot do it well but needs more than just the light coverage of powder foundation the new complexion cream foundations do exactly that i have used numerous cream \( or liquid powder \) foundations and this is by far the best and at a good price as well ! the neat little compact includes a mirror and separate storage space for your sponge which i love because i hate when my sponges become covered in product all in the same space as a regular compact i 've personally never been one to use compact mirrors myself however but it 's not the package or the sponge which i love it 's the product it 's neither too liquid nor is it too stiff like some products it 's perfectly creamy and works well with the sponge it comes with you really need n't use a lot to have even overall covered but by using more you can obtain a thicker coverage i find that this makeup blends well with my skin and does a good job of evening out my skin tone as well without appearing too much like a mask you can feel it a little but it somehow just feels right on my skin also i do recommend using a powder over it to reduce shine overall i love this makeup	19

1	there are alot of reasons so you dumb people that rtae it low probably never played it heres why i think its great why its great fun in editor to just mess around \( no need to test map to have people fight \) many units that can make diffrent stratadgies god powers are great many mythical units that make the game unique the titans are crazzzzy you beat the campaign \? well download the new free one online go to the main website of aom d d d beat every campagin that exsists \? you can still play online make many skirmish wars and even make your own campaigns many fun maps can be easy or hard depending what difficulty 's you choose so its great for everyone new armies gods powers all that good stuff so basically this games greta buy it actually better yet buy the gold edition which has this expansion and the original which you need to use the expansion have fun	19
0	main pro an additional unbiased source of information in an area where there is not nearly enoughmain con too few products reviewedas a first time mom \( and a compulsive researcher \) i found this book most helpful as a cross reference with other sources \( baby bargains girlfriend 's guide to baby gear and reviews in babycenter and at amazon \) i will say though that i found myself trusting the advice of alan and denise fields and of vicki lovine more than that of the authors of this book when reading through bb bargains and girlfriends guide i felt more keenly that the products were being judged by real parents who thought about parents' needs consumer reports seemed a little less thoughtful and definately less comprehensive getting ready for a baby is a behemoth task the sheer amount of stuff you need clothing bedding furniture strollers car seats feeding devices toys and the myriad of choices that exist for each item can be very overwhelming and because there are so many crib manufacturers stroller makers etc no single superstore like bbrus or target can carry all of the major brands it would be impossible to register at any one of these stores using only the recommendations of consumer reports' book now perhaps not everyone enters parenthood quite as clueless as i was about baby gear and if you have friends and family who can share enough information with you \( and better yet stuff ! \) about these products then you probably do n't need any of these books but if you are the kind of person who wants to know all of your options and who works to get the most for her or his money you 'll need more than this book	19

1	got my chillow a few months ago and wish i had not waited so long ! it is great ! my own personal thermostat having gone haywire years ago i have wished for something to help me sleep and be cool this is it ! first it allows my husband to cuddle up next to me without my pushing him away cause he 's so darn warm and i just ca n't take the extra heat second i have wished for a firm pillow forever ! ! and have tried many different pillows and a great side benefit of the chillow is that it makes my pillow really firm it can be a bit too cold for a minute or two but it evens out before long for those of you who have that problem you might consider doing what i did i purchased a bedsack quilted zippered pillow cover put the pillow the chillow in that and then in a pillowcase and it 's just perfect might also help the vinyl scent that some of you complain about i will agree that the chillow makes my pillow very heavy but that is my only complaint and i'm not carrying it around so the weight is really not an issue other than that i wish i had purchased one of these chillows long ago it is a menopausal woman 's dream come true !	19

0	i bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the dollar tree when i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures i decided to give them a try i have two complaints with this product one the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and i could'nt get one of the phones to communicate the pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone	19

1	when i bought this camera the sales people tried to get me to buy another battery they said the one that came with it would only be good for about 20 minutes now i have bought alot of items in my lifetime a 20 min battery on a camera just doesnt seem like a very good business choice so i said no so i got the camera charged the battery until the light went green \( which sucked because i wanted to play with it right when i got it \) and started taking pictures \( oh i also got a 2g cf \) worked great so i planned to go up a mountain and take soem scenery shots keeping in mind what the sales person had told me i pocketed the charger just incase well 6000' 300 pictures and 5 hours later the camera is still running strong still have 200 shots left for the trip home battery life indicator hasnt budged off of the full button so all in all i think the battery life is great now i can see if your taking say thousands of pictures all in a row you may need another but for just going on a trip and shooting a few pictures at every stop point the original will work fine as for the quality of photos i love them	19

1	i just purchased a mogo mouse and i'm amazed at how usable it is i was extremely skeptical \( and probably would n't have bought one \) until i was able to try a colleague 's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is the one thing and it 's a pretty big thing is the lack of scroll wheel technology that 's a sorely missed feature in this mouse that said there are always trade offs but in this case that 's the only one battery life seems great usability is great convenience is great just add the touch pad and it 'll be the mouse for notebook computer users !	19
0	i bought vista to get the inevitable familiarity over with as early as possible and what i discovered was an operating system not even close to being compatible yet half if not 80 of all routers are not vista ready yet so you ca n't get a network running for at least a few more months any accesories you own with your system no longer work unless they 're compatible \( ie printers scanners burners etc \) so you not only buy an operating system you have to buy an entirely new set of hardware to go with it majority of my programs did not work with vista be it adobe software maya poser and god forbid any games you own like warcraft for the expense and complete hassel it 's not worth owning until eveything is ready \( which will probably be a year from now \) save your money i returned my copy	19
1	i bought this as a gift for my head shaving husband he is very happy with his close shave and i have used it as well for my legs a tiny bit goes a long way and it provides a very close smooth shave the downside is the cost it 's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel	19
0	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	19
0	i would rate this zero stars but the system will not allow me to do this hence the one star i bought this watch for my wife as a 2006 christmas present the crystal subsequently cracked due to temperature changes the elegant design of a thin gold rim holding the crystal cannot stand large rapid temperature differences i went to my local jeweler who was very familiar with the crystal issue with skagen watches i called skagen seems they are aware of this problem too however the only option offered was to send the watch back for repair pay 25 00 for repair of the crystal pay 8 95 for s h and then pay insurance and return postage as i paid 65 00 for the watch i consider this a total ripoff i would not buy another product from skagen and recommend that amazon discontinue selling any skagen products until they become a responsible corporate partner it is a pretty watch and seemed like a good deal but it is not turning out that way or you can buy this watch and only wera it in warm climates	19

0	i just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid 's indoor soccer games the light was low but not that low you should be able to take a picture without the flash when i took the flash off the picture looked fine on the preview but came out completely black yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level ! what a disappointment i am going to try to return it	19
0	like many of the reviewers here i am an anne rice fan however i knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them i mean few of the dracula movies throughout the years have had anything to do with bram stoker 's novel all i wanted and expected was a flashy no substance guilty pleasure movie a la dracula 2000 that alone should tell you my expectations but qotd failed even as a guilty pleasure the storyline did n't make a lot of sense when taken on it 's own and the acting was bad to bland i also take issue with the badly done look of the vampires rice 's vampires are supposed to be beautiful whereas this bunch looked like eurotrash or people at a halloween spook house however one good thing about this movie is the music videos for lestat since the videos are included on the dvd it earns 1 star	19
0	this item was an absolute waste of money and i'm all the more irritated for having purchased it upon attempting to merely insert the device the outer case of the dongle split open what i discovered \? that cute little 'antenna' does n't actually connect to anything ! it 's just a piece of plastic that hangs off the side ! when i finally managed to get the damn thing running \( the installation was completely unintuitive and required repeatedly attempting the same actions to so much as pair connect a device \) it worked fine once i turned off my laptop removed the dongle and was amazed to discover that subsequently my computer failed to recognize the device at all do yourself a favor shell out the extra 15 20 30 bucks or whatever and get a decent 2 0 bluetooth usb adapter do n't make this mistake	19

0	i purchased this item on 6 3 06 from amazon and a 250gb ata ide hitachi drive to go in it from another vendor it all went together fine and i could mount the volume easily enough the first thing i noticed is that it 's wi fi would n't work with wep with my powerbook it 'd work without encryption on the airport extreme but not with wep or with wpa i noted that and used it without the wi fi for a few days i noted it would n't hold time at all consistently it would n't register a network time server 's data and was always in the wrong time zone so i had to fidge by seven hours to get it to match my time but it would still drift about ten minutes per day and then jump an hour or two randomly making sorting which file is the more current a bit iffy i found it slow to mount and it would sometimes unmount over working wep wi fi or hardwired gigabit connections which was disheartening i then decided to call tech support which is when things went from bad to worse calls took a minimum 25 minutes to get through initial screening to tech support staff the tech support staff were not familiar with the product and would transfer me around which too up to another thirty minutes folks with extensions rarely answered or returned calls or e mails after 12 hours with customer support over two weeks and a not yet released firmware update it would work with wpa psk or open but still no wep they could n't fix the time drift issue i repeatedly asked for a replacement but they always had a few more hoops to make me jump through whether it be repeating a test for the upmteenth time or another firmware update they just would n't spare me the trouble and replace the unit until i was ready to scream by this time i was out of amazon 's return policy timeframe they refused to give me a refund after repeated attempts i even sent a letter telling them to please send a refund check and not another unit or i 'd post my experience here on amazon of course i got a replacement unit with no other reply now i 've got to get rid of the thing onebay or whatever take the loss and move on i would never buy another d link product i would avoid this thing like anthrax weaponized anthrax i bought an iomega nas unit which works very well has multiple drives and raid and though it costs more provides decent value and it works d link has a lot to learn about customer service and should not release beta untested products to the consumer market shame on them	19
1	the changer performs perfectly i was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget the only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original about one foot shorter other than that it is fine i gave my original changer to my daughter whose charger died just before leaving the country	19
1	when i first became obsessed with indian cooking i taught myself from books and did everything by hand including roasting and grinding my own spice blends from whole spices \( if you want to teach yourself indian cooking check out my quot so you want to quot guide for helpful cookbooks \) since then i have tried many pre made spice blends most of them lacking in flavor when compared to what i make myself and then i found neera 's garam masala on the shelf at the market and discovered that this amazing product is as intense lively and flavorful as the garam masala i used to spend hours making hooray ! ! i was very happy to find it online at amazon because the markets i shop at do not carry specialty products consistently so i was becoming frustrated when i could n't find a new jar as my old jar was starting to look empty double hooray ! ! this is great stuff and now i never have to be without	19
1	the chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten free nana 's cookies though the lemon is pretty good too i have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to for those of us who have dietary restrictions it 's a different story it does take a while to get used to gluten free fare but these cookies are among the best i 've had which is pretty impressive since they do n't even have sugar in them and the fact that they do n't have gluten eggs nuts or dairy in them either is wonderful \( yes there are those of us out there allergic to all these things \) i just wish more stores carried them but now that i 've found them on amazon i 'll be ordering in bulk	19
0	this is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now even appearing in one episode of leave it to beaver in the late '50s and on the cover of one of simon and garfunkles albums of the late '60s i 've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers including red wing some comments which apply to this style in general \( and not just wolverines \) pros the wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing working on concrete or walking long distances on hard surfaces also the non agressive tread means that dirt and grass does n't track into the house after doing chores outside the moc toe tends to breath through the seams so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot dry conditions a great boot for the desert and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers cons the wedge sole does n't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep loose surfaces \( which i 've used them for but for which they really were n't intended \) gravel will roll right out from under them none of the several brands i have owned were water resistant at all walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily we used to say your feet get wet two days before it rains so perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the pacific northwest specifically the wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box they have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support the color was actually more of a brown clay rather than what i would call tan the quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good actually better looking stitching than my red wings however i was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather the leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than i have ever seen in any work boot thinner even than in many suede sneakers while my ankles were covered they did n't feel at all supported or protected after considering for a couple of days i decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for amazon the sportsmans guide they had provided a return shipping label in the box so i taped the box closed applied the label and took it to the post office i received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package and a notice of a credit applied to my account so while i'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which i received i do give good marks to sportsmans guide for a quick and relatively painless return i ended up purchasing the georgia spr 6 farm and ranch boot with wedge sole also available through amazon for further details please see my review	19
1	i purchased this case for my canon a530 camera i find that it does a great job of being light durable and compact it keeps the camera clean and scratch free however i wish the case had a better carrying capacity i would have liked a bit more space for spare batteries and chips i use different ones for different pictures or video batteries do tend to give out after a long day shooting and convient extras would be handy the case has beltloops but not a good shoulder strap for times when a belt is not worn that can be a bit akward otherwise this case is a good protector of my camera and fits it well	19

0	this maybe the worst interface i have ever had the displeasure of working with and that includes console applications with dos interfaces edlin and fdisk are more user friendly than the mcafee 's security center there is noway to disable the software except by uninstalling the program or opening xp 's admin tools and then forcing the services to stop which is not a recommenable approach for the average user here is a short list of the probelms that i encountered counter spy is cheaper easier to use and has an interface that is user friendly ! cannot select to disable during non internet use so i can run software that security center has conflicts with like protools 7 3 recording software the scan results are vague ie returns 6 quarantined threats but does n't display what the threats are and you ca n't print the result either there are more there are some good features but the detractors win by a land slide	19
1	i reluctantly gave this superb film 5 stars not because of any shortcomings in the script or the acting both are unbelievebly good but because of what the studio had done to the movie it was originally released at over 3 hours in lenght when exhibitors demanded that it be shortened warner 's obliged by cutting it to 154 minutes in the early 1980s the studio realized what it really had and set about reconstructing and restoring the movie because of initial sloppiness \( footage being thrown out \) it became impossible to fully reconstruct the film the result is that there is a segment of some 7 minutes of stills about one hour into the picture trying to restore some of the lost scenes gone too apparently is vicki lester 's screen test all of this aside what the viewer sees on the 1999 digitally restored dvd is superb the color correction of the nearly 20 minutes it was possible to restore is excellent the actors' performances are outstanding not only is garland a superb singer and dancer but the close intimate scenes with mason radiate a warmth and tenderness rarely captured on film mason too is superb as norman maine when drunk his character is absolutely dispicable becoming phisical and violent great too is the supporting cast jack carson as the studio publicist libby plays the role with much more profesionalialism and less corniness than his counterpart lionel streater did in 1937 this is by far the best version of the film and well worth owning and viewing dispite the minor shortcomings of its reconstruction there is not one corny word of dialog in the moss hart script	19

1	we 've all heard of final fantasy 8 and final fantasy 10 but does anyone ever mention the game in between \? final fantasy 9 is sadly the most underestimated game in the final fantasy series it 's the one that pulled me into my ff fandom and though it 's around 6 years old i still love it the reason it 's not as famous as the others is probably because ff9 came out on the playstation just before the playstation 2 came out the storyline is spellbinding it captures you right at the beginning and flows beautifully through cities of eternal rain clashing monsters and the \( traditional plot theme in almost every rpg alive ! \) fate of the world itself everyone can relate to ff9 's characters who struggle to find who they are or where they belong and in the end find or almost find the meaning in a stunning finale then you 'll find yourself cheering for them \( or mourning over them if you become attached to one who dies \) the music \? nobuo you 've outdone yourself ff9 's songs are masterpieces and you 'll find yourself humming you're not alone or melodies of life without knowing it and of course a couple pieces will bring back amusing scenes just by mentioning their name \( slew of love letters anyone \? \) any cons \? hard question if there were a problem then i ca n't target it perhaps leveling up your character may take a while but then again that 's a traditional part of every ff game so it should n't be counted and being able to play as a few of the legendary characters \( fratley beatrix \) would be great but that would take away their status would n't it \? \( and that 's an opinion so i 'll let it slide \) i can think about this until my head explodes but i wo n't be able to target an actual flaw i lyrit find final fantasy 9 the perfect rpg game overall and again this has got to be the greatest ff game out there i 've played most of the others popular in the series now but they just do n't strike me like ff9 wait what are you listening to me for \? get ff9 and play it once you do my review will look like it 's degrading this game	19
0	i do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment but i simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it this is called censorship and it gives me the creeps as a parent i have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children so to realise that somebody has been cheating on me trying to do my job so that i did not have to explain how society has evolved how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud this review is about the harper collins edition edited by patricia c and frederick l mckissak illustrated by michael hague	19
1	if you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always huge to more then make up for the difference yes it is cheaply made and not designed to last but so are all similar products so it is at least par for the course in that regard just trying to even out the review i did n't think the other review was fair	19
0	i have purchased ak in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed the shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy i would not recommend this shoe to anyone	19
1	gloves are toasty perform as expected and are a sweet luxury after a long cold day on the slopes however the d sized batteries \( 1 per glove \) are considerably more bulky than what i expected most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 aa batteries but no just one bit fat chicken roastin' d sized battery good product but consider whether wearing the big ol' d 's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves or whether you 'll barely notice being bundled up and bulkified anyway may also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it 's really nippy out	19
1	this was a whole lot cheaper than the verizon dealer wanted for this product my only disappointment was that it did n't have clear instructions which was lg 's fault	19
1	this mount is nicely designed and well made it fit the tv perfectly our only criticism is that the screws provided for attaching it to the wall were of poor quality the heads stripped out right away and it took a trip to the hardware store to get replacements	19
1	the belkin tunetalk is fabuous for using an ipod as a digital recorder i have had very good results recording various music rehearsals \( children 's choir to big band \) with and without an external powered microphone \( sony ecm ms908c stereo mic \) attached since i already had the mic the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a zoom digital recorder for this type of recording i have n't plugged it into a mixing board yet i suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a mackie 1202 or better i bought a usb power adaptor so i would n't have to worry about battery drain it plugs into the tunetalk and provides power to the ipod no it is n't as good as a high dollar recorder dedicated mic pre 's and a pair of neumann mics serious recording requires serious equipment however for all those other recordings the tunetalk stereo is a great recording option for about 60 and your trusty ipod	19
1	i 'll have to accept that even tough i'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album it 's very melodic and more mature also the acoustic version of the diary of jane is amazing i personally recommend the songs breath evil angel and my favorite dance with the devil	19
0	this watch does not work according to the manual i have tryed to get it to work about 75 times my wife has tryed about at least 25 30 times and i took it to a jewler and even he could not get it to work this watch is a piece of jun	19
1	this is the best book written by stephen king ! i 've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before i die	19
0	i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i was n't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much once he did start playing gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in by the time things settle down the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface the mix is horrible the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the concert experience there are high points in the show but the low points are rock bottom comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart two versions are provided on this dvd from the concert and in the bonus section neither of the guest singers \( robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff \) know the words have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience the very best thing on this dvd is oddly enough in the bonus section screamin' jay hawkins' i put a spell on you a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland almost makes the dvd worth buying almost watch jonathan demme 's beautiful treatment of neil young heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show that is the gold standard	19
1	worth the price as my window is always clean just for a comparison i leave a new but lesser quality wiper on the passenger side the difference is incredible	19
0	we registered for two of these mobiles for our twins we recieved both of them upon putting them together we realized that the mobile ca n't operate without the pieces hitting the bar that holds it to the crib ! how annoying ! we returned them both	19
0	i bought this underwater lighting system with four laser beams and when i installed it one of the beams came defective and did n't lit on i did n't matter because they look beautiful underwater one week later i noticed that another light went off and two days later the other two shutdown too i replaced the beams but they stop working days later it 's my opinion that this is the worst product you can buy to your aquarium \( unless you only want to use it for one or two weeks \)	19
1	if you own a q you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible this charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery which is great so i can charge my phone with the standard battery and have the extended one verizon sells in the back slot never having to worry about battery life again also it makes a wonderful stand for the phone and when hooked to the usb cable you get data conectivity too only downside it wo n't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged	19
1	the transfers of the 5 movies found here are worth every penny ! we grew up watching these on philadelphia 's channel 17 with show host dr shock and the creature double features back in the mid 70 's the pictures were always so dark and grainy well not anymore folks ! universal has done an amazing job on the picture clean up and sound restoration ! bright and crystal clear along with wonderful sound ! also a very nice fold out dvd holder ! the theatrical trailers were transferred in their original release condition which will allow you to compare how good of a job was done on the restoring of the movies to dvd ! do n't wait to long in purchasing your set at a cheap price they have already disappeared off of store shelves in our area !	19
0	in all honesty i 'd rate the fragrance itself as 5 stars however the scent does not last for love nor money which is why i give it a mere 1 star you 'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and consequently before you know it you 've depleted your perfume ! talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and if they 're honest they will tell you exactly what i 've written here because i adore the scent i'm going to try the baby phat goddess body lotion and see if that has a lingering effect	19
0	amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free tv show whenever you buy a dvd in dec well they charged me for it and i did n't really want it i just thought i 'd try it because it was free there is no verification before you are charged either it is supposed to be free you hit a button and boom there is a charge on your credit card never again ! ! ! and the directions do n't work so i do n't even have the free stuff i paid for	19
1	i 've been doing yoga for 7 years i 've gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now \( i do n't like how they get stretchy after a couple of years \) so i decided to buy something more durable i love the texture of this mat it 's very solid feeling with a good bit of stick and it does n't move around at all it has just the right amount of cushion to it and i use it on a hard floor i also bought the lumi towel \( large size \) also by manduka to put on the mat since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time i get to the middle of my routine and this can make any mat slippery i did n't have any trouble with the coating on the mat it wore off after a little bit and i used the towel until it did i also did n't agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy it 's a bit heavy but not too much to carry around all over i made a carry handle from a yoga strap \( looped over both ends of the rolled up mat \) and throw it over my shoulder	19
1	we 've used this seat when traveling and everyday use at home when our son was about 15 months old i put the highchair away and started using this it can be taken apart easily and put in the dishwaser ! ! it folds down so it can be put away easily if you 're having guests unlike a big highchair ! great chair !	19
0	i purchased the set of two park smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door but even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again i may say the service i got through amazon com was first rate it 's the product i found wanting	19
1	well written well acted and well directed this is much better than 99 of all films on tv or in the theatres the only reason it is unknown is its adult content marijuana smoking and romantic affairs lending amusing background to a woman 's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life this is that rare bird an intelligent film for adults my favorite line joe mantegna 's remark to mia farrow you 're really interesting after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible it is not a 5 star film like say witness but it is an excellent small film this is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	19
1	i did a lot of searching and review reading on the internet before finally deciding what to buy i am convinced quick draw ii is the best value available of any make by any conpany the features on the qdii are generally found only on much higher priced detectors this thing really works as advertised i have already found several coins and other things right in my own yard it will reliably indicate what coin is being detected although it many times confuses dimes and pennies on the lcd readout it is very sensitive and detects most coin size items very reliably to about 6 or 8 inches the auto notch discrimination works well and filters out most trash items i have used metal detectors that ended up being aggravating and frustrating this one is a pleasure to use and is quickly becoming a relaxing and profitable pastime for me if you want a serious metal detector without spending a whole lot of money give it a try you wo n't be disappointed	19
0	overall i have always enjoyed robin william and billy crystal 's performance in many other movies but i must admit to my surprise that it was n't making me laughing on the floor as i usually do the script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing did n't like the ending it was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it 's normal for mothers to lie i hope someday to see both robin and billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	19
