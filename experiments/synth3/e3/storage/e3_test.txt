0	uhmm yah this is a low budget film but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck i 've seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art it 's impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing sideline secrets for even untrained actors this is bad it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there was n't supposed to be someone in the backgroung i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom a garage into what was supposed to be a club and at the end of the home movie i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive \( quite so too ! \) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever so hard to be a soft core porn thriller in all seriousness this thing gave me a horrible migraine if you are stupid enough to actually buy this \( thankfully my roommate rented it \) invest in either a bottle of advil or a sledge hammer you 'll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins	20
1	i took my last science course about 40 years ago and had forgotten how interesting science can be this book is not light reading and some people will probably not get past the first few pages but i really enjoyed it i found tons of new information on mushrooms in spite of the fact that i studied mushrooms in college \( until my father decided science was not for girls and convinced me to go to law school yep those were the good old days \) you will enjoy it as long as you take into account that it is a scientific book perfect for geeks	20
0	this camera will probably go down in nikon 's history as one of its most over priced and disappointing cameras i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january 2003 from the start the colors never looked right especially the ghastly magenta toned skin tones i also bought the sb800s \( 3 of them \) thinking the cls would be a great addition but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments the camera has a wonderful feel viewfinder and reasonably good controls but the results are disappointing the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition \( canon \) offers nikon finally realized this and on dec 13 decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price 1 200 it just so happened mine was in melville n y with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty these include bad af performance since upgrading to v2 of the firmware bad color overexposure blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value i would strongly suggest that you do n't buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers indeed forget nikon and go to canon	20

1	so here 's the deal i'm from omaha you ca n't go two miles without an omaha steaks store here we just call em steaks i can go to any butcher shop in omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything omaha steaks has to offer for considerably less this has always been my stance that is until i had these these are quite simply the best steaks yes they 're expensive but if you 're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday 's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead you wo n't get a better steak in a restaurant and my uncle 's the head chef in a steak house i could be stabbed just for saying that cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet i 've ever had i ca n't stress to you how good these are it 's still the only steak i buy from omaha steaks but when you come from the land of steaks that 's saying a lot sorry texas you may have more cows but nebraska beef is simply better	20

0	this album is one of the only live albums that i do n't have i have heard samples and a few extra songs on other cds though the first thing i hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that stevie could n't have been more high his performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group \( specifically reese wynans \) most poeple do n't know this but on the old vinyl copy of this album \( i 've never heard it but someone told me \) there was originally a 14th track it was the song that usually comes close to the end of stevie 's sets the song was life without you since it was the very last song i'm guessing stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything being high is one thing but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible in the old vinyl disc stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that reese wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted this track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness	20

0	hydrolized gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend do a search on that and you 'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones mmmmm does n't that sound good \? what 's more this gelatin protein is incomplete so it does n't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles it may taste ok but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them or just eat jello if you really want gelatin avoid ones with collagen too same issue	20
1	after talking to several pharmaceutical reps i know i decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself this book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry what kind of people you 'll be dealing with what the hiring pricess is like \( with particular emphasis on the interviews \) and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired i'm very glad that i took the time to read this book because after finishing it i realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable obviously this is simply my own opinion and i know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work but nearly every single thing about it from the superficial way applicants are screened to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job sounds simply awful to me if you are considering a career as a drug rep you should definitely do your homework to make sure it 's really something you would enjoy this book may very well convince you that you would love it if so that 's great and i hope you are successful but if this kind of work is not right for you this book can be equally helpful because you 'll find out by reading it what the job is really like there are a lot of books on this subject on the market right now and although this one was helpful i have to say that i think insider 's guide to the world of pharmaceutical sales by jane williams is far more comprehensive and detailed than this one if you only buy one book definitely buy that one instead but if you buy two books pharmaceutical landing is a good second choice one more thing there 's some sweet irony about this book that i just have to report the author goes to great lengths describing how he scrutinizes every single thing about job applicants from their shoes to their body language he also stresses well written resumes and cover letters one obvious piece of advice is that job applicants spell check everything before submitting it imagine my surprise then when on the very next page it says candidates should right a short paragraph about their job experiences it seems to me that someone who is going to be as critical as this author is about job candidates ought to take the time to spell check his own book	20

1	this is i believe the best fleetwood mac album ever record by the band it begins with a nice quick paced tune second hand news and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there the album itself does not have a bad tune on it in fact of all the 'regular' albums from fleetwood mac \( excluding greatest hits compilations \) this album has more hits on it than any other hits like 'dreams ' 'never going back ' 'do n't stop ' 'go your own way ' 'the chain' and 'you make loving fun all of these get enormous radio play moreover 'dreams' was a number one hit and the album itself held the number one slot for months on end and has sold over 18 million copies in the u s and over 30 million worldwide putting into the top 50 best selling albums of all time in fact an interesting tid bit from the liner notes of the cd describe how the album had such an impact on america 's youth that during that generation if you were to ask a student to spell 'rumor' there would inevitably be two 'u 's' in the spelling now that is a very strong impact on culture every song on this album is arranged on the album as if it flowed right into the other making for an overall well rounded album one of my all time favorite songs from fleetwood mac is on this album never going back which contains some great acoustic guitar work from one of rock 's premier guitarists lindsey buckingham and in my opinion the best christine mcvie song ever written songbird now with this release you can also get on a second cd the various rough takes and outtakes of the songs on this album this makes for great listening to hear how the songs developed and were recorded moreover early demos are included along with two 'jam sessions now more than ever this is a must have cd for any lover of rock music \( or music in general for that matter \) if you are a fleetwood mac fan then chances are you own this album but if you are just getting introduced to the band then you must buy this cd i highly recommend it	20

0	i purchased the standard edition of x3 primarily for 3 reasons 1 \) it claims to have the ability to convert pdf files into wp format 2 \) it claims to be able to organize your e mail files through the use of wp mail well beyond the capabilities of outlook express and 3 \) it claims enhanced use of wp for word processing what i found was a product that met only one out of three of its claims in baseball batting 333 will put you into the hall of fame in business fulfilling one of three claims will put you into bankruptcy ! while the pdf converter is a rather good tool wp3 mail is unstable \( and this is from their tech support department \) it destabilizes your use of e mail to the point of making it virtually unusable in terms of reliability i imported older e mail from outlook express when i installed the wp x3 software only to later find out that the system crashed regularly i could not get at my older imported e mail and could not find a practical way to reverse the importing back into outlook express what really irked me was that their tech support was worthless in rectifying the situation they merely responded by saying they were aware of the problem and may release a patch to help sometime in the future ahhhhh ! as to the alleged improved word processing power i have experienced more bugs then appear in an animal planet channel special on insects in the amazon jungle unwanted page formating changes occur when i click my mouse on the page i had just finish reformatting undesired line spacing would appear on pages the list goes on but who has the time to be more detailed do yourself a favor and avoid the product if you need to upgrade check out the latest version of ms word you will be far more satisfied i'm sure	20

0	we purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel i think it 's safe to say that we have an ambivalent relationship with the volo not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it a definite thumbs down on the up side it is very light and folds easily and is compact not to mention that everyone gets to see you have a maclaren stroller in a wonderful shade of orange the stroller is great for the airport and quick shopping trips when you are in and out of the car we first purchased the volo without springing for the seat pad this was a mistake as our daughter was clearly uncomfortable and was unwilling to spend significant time in the stroller the seat pad did increase her comfort level but she still grows tired of the volo much more quickly than her larger stroller i think this has to do with the fact that she is not very upright in the volo and cannot shift much in the seat as it offers no support on top of it the velcro on the seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold the stroller a minor annoyance but a hassle all the same the awning offers very little sun protection the mesh cargo area holds very little and is difficult to access on top of that you need to empty it completely in order to fold the stroller when it comes to travel the volo leaves much to be desired with limited cargo room it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything on the handles it has no recline making it difficult for children to sleep well a problem when you want to spend the day wandering further while it is great to have such a lightweight stroller when getting it in and out of the car riding escalators and getting on and off the bus the volo flounders once you get off well paved surfaces we encountered potholes dirt paths cobblestones and sand in our tavels and the volo was a disaster the wheels would spin erratically and catch in large divets and gutters locking the front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief cobblestones were particularly disastrous as the stroller was so hard to manage and such an uncomfortable ride that we ended up carrying both the child and the volo if i had to do it over i would opt for a compact stroller that weighs a bit more but offers larger wheels easy access storage and a supported reclining seat	20

1	after many years of the same look and marginal upgrades family tree maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product there are still some awkward navigation issues but overall i think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and have n't upgraded in a while or are just starting out having used the available online services that this company offers i was pleased to find a new feature that integrates some of the online search functionality although the integration is a bit superficial it is useful and made some of my online searches of their databases more productive i think this is a big step in the right direction and hope they continue to add to the power of this feature as it makes the treasure trove of data they have more accessible too bad they do not make a mac version as i prefer this to the mac products available and so i have to use it with parallels which is not so convenient	20

0	following orson welles' fascinating yet tantalizing career can be frustrating for the aficionado so much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries welles directed for british tv in the 1950s the missing link in welles' work exults the snapcase boilerplate this is a bit of an overstatement given that far more significant works have n't seen the light of day \( don quixote and the other side of the wind to name a couple \) the documentaries do help to fill the gap in welles' output for the 1950s a decade in which he directed only three feature films around the world is a good quality dvd and unquestionably the work of welles but a ultimately a shadow of what he was capable of the five episodes on this dvd explore various aspects of european culture welles takes his camera in search of basque country spanish bullfights the idiosyncratic denizens of paris' st germain des pres and the loquacious and venerable chelsea pensioners the st germain des pres episode best typifies the offbeat subject matter welles spends most of his time interviewing a commune dweller who makes his own clothes after that welles dashes through the town capturing glimpses of celebrities like jean cocteau and eddie constantine \( lemmy caution \) before discovering a group of letterists who are dedicated to \( you guessed it \) inventing new letters unfortunately welles' typically low budget and the nature of the subject matter limit his range of cinematic expression despite the exotic and obscure locales most of the footage consists of relatively static interviews captured in long takes with obligatory reaction shots of welles inserted to break up the monotony even the bullfight episode lacks the dynamic footage one might expect welles' camera is grounded in the stands preventing him from getting involved in the action only towards the end of st germain des pres and in the second basque episode does welles get inventive developing the active swirling camera style he employed in films like mr arkadin like a record that 's worth owning for one or two songs around the world with orson welles does have one episode that justifies its purchase the second basque episode true the first few minutes repeat the introduction from the first basque show but after that welles has a lot of fun interviewing kids playing 'pelote' \( a game similar to jai alai \) welles gets his camera into the pelote action and seems rejuvenated by the subject matter an 11 year old boy joins welles and acts as a tour guide for the rest of the show the episode ends dramatically with welles quoting a basque aphorism against a night sky lit by fireworks for a better example of welles' creativity in the documentary genre check out his 1974 essay film f for fake just released on dvd around the world with orson welles is a far more pedestrian effort but it does give welles fans something to look at while they await the more significant releases that are hopefully on the not too distant horizon	20

0	zero best describes how well amazon supports what they sell great deal on this toaster absolutely and it does a nice job on toast but after using the left side twice it stopped locking down so now we have a 2 slice toaster amazon just takes your money and runs giving the standard answer that you have to take it up with krups krups to their credit at least will look at the problem and repair or replace it if they determine it is a warranty covered problem unfortunately you 'll have to box the item up and ship it to one of about krups service centers around the country to see if they fix it or not at your cost shipping cost more than the toaster did save yourself the aggravation go buy your toaster at walmart bed bath beyond or someplace that will at least swap it out for you without all this hassle	20

0	first off i usually just stick to rating critiquing movies but every time i see an ad on this website for this time warner \( or whatever the hell the company calls itself this week \) rag mag i start to see red entertainment weekly which was once an interesting weekly deluge from the ho hum of everyday life has become just another rag crapped out weekly to stand on newstands week after week prostituting for your hard earned cash back in the summer of 89 ew was released and after i read a few issues i decided to subscribe i was instantly hooked \( the new issue would arrive in my mailbox the saturday before it would hit regular newstands \) i liked getting the latest news and reviews from movies music t v and video \( that was later added in the mid 90 's \) the problem with the magazine started in the late 90 's i started to notice that ew would cover a big movie or event that had n't yet been released and then the following week bash the hell out of it or try to get some piece of dirt on it in order to generate more sales i also hate the damn lists that ew comes up with the latest entitled the top 100 most memorable movie lines was a joke these lists have always annoyed me because i feel they are truly not thought out and therefore not thought provoking the other most important thing i noticed was the absolute lack of an honest review case in point a few weeks ago i picked up the latest issue in which the movie catwoman had been reviewed \( i was n't to sure if it was gleiberman or shwarzbaum that critiqued it \) i first logged onto rotten tomatoes com to see what percentile catwoman recieved from the nation 's critics out of roughly 115 reviews catwoman only got 10 of the good reviews while the rest trashed it \( a film needs at least to get a grade of 60 65 in order to place it as a fresh or good movie \) that makes catwoman the worst reviewed film so far for 2004 yet ew gave the film a b what erkes me even more is that catwoman is released by warner bros the same company that owns the rights to the harry potter films the lord of the rings trilogy yes the wb owns entertainment weekly is warner bros trying to bribe or threaten its own critics at one of its most popular lucrative magazine 's \? i'm not the only who has seen this developement people have written in saying that there is favoritism among warner products that are reviewed in the magazine ew of course hotly denies anything of the kind thumping there chests and standing behind there reviews possibly in fear of being fired \( they will deny that also \) my only question to the reviewers at entertainment weekly is whats it like to stand in your own pile of bull it \? or better yet what 's it like to stand on a democratic podium \?	20
0	i 'd never read berry before but as far as i can tell this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory however it 's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm there are two related problems with the book one of presentation and one of tone the problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there 's no room for specifics so while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of berry 's vision there 's no detail to back it all up the problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at of course some of the pieces are lectures but there 's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book it comes out when berry uses certain words such as the three as of appropriate authentic and adequate when these are used \( as they often are \) there he 's obviously made some kind of value judgment but the reader is never let in on it the end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir which is unfortunate since i tend to agree with berry on a lot of things \( though not his anti abortion stance \) small farms are good agribusiness is bad stewardship of the land is good extraction industries are bad treating the body as an organic whole is good and things of that nature alas he has a tendency of making sweeping assertions and accusations that are far too simplistic and shrill to be useful two examples from the first 15 pages will suffice to illustrate this is a world in which the cultures that preserve nature and rural life will simply be disallowed and communists and capitalists are alike in their contempt for country people country life and country places berry also succumbs to the trick of creating straw men to counter his theses for example in one essay he claims that conservationists are people who want to simply preserve land in a pristine untouched state and that 's all while there are certainly some conservationists who feel that way they are a small minority of a a much larger community who actually is in almost total accord with berry 's views on stewardship and land use it certainly does n't help matters that his view of small scale farming appears to be heavily tinted with rose colored glasses his claims that modern agribusinesses has rendered the small farm economically unviable sounds like a reasonable proposition however it ignores the fact that historically small scale farming ran on the thinnest of margins was subject to all kind of external instability \( weather vermin etc \) and operated on only slightly better than a subsistence level in farming cash is scarce that 's why people abandoned it in droves whenever the opportunity presented itself such as in wwii when all those defense industry factories were opened in california \( of course in berry 's vision you do n't really need cash because you barter for everything you need from your neighbors \) berry 's exhortations to create small scale communities is worthy stuff and even in cities people are creating this the growth of csas farmers markets and the like in the past decade is a tangible indicator of this however to achieve the large scale results berry seeks requires a more rigorous roadmap than what is provided in this slim collection	20
1	avatar is so awesome ! i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it 's got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i 'd say it 's the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it 's got a real depth to it and is n't only fit for kids but teenagers \( like me \) and adults alike highly recomended ! i do n't know if the downloading was not working in the past but it 's definitely working now i 've downloaded a few and they all work fine for me	20

1	and secured their musical legacy the real thing was a solid rock rap mixture with newly hired mike patton providing vocals on angel dust patton had a lot more creative input providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to faith no more it 's a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts and with good reason this album is all over the board land of sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies \( which is the supposed inspiration \) while caffeine is an anthem for patton 's drug of choice and one of fnm 's most energetic recordings then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing patton 's range and sense of fun like rv which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an rv not exactly bilboard material but fun adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band jim martin was having creative differences yet pumps out some of his best work here tensions may have fueld a more agressive record and fnm would never sound better than they do on this album it 's the bands chemistry both good and bad that make this album work commercially this might have not been the hit the record company wanted but its legacy can still be heard today and it 's still a great record to crank up for a drive barely showing its 15 year old age	20
0	i purchased a nikon for my first camera i just loved how you can take it anywhere fits handy in your pocket and perfect size i could n't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo 's for my birthday i took over 100 photo 's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost i was so devistated the video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people 's faces my friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo 's so maybe i just got the short end of the stick but this was my first camera so its okay for starters but if you love to take photo 's be full aware that on a low battery that it just might not want to hold them a major plus i do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image ! that i 'll give 5 stars to everything else i 'd have to say 2 stars !	20

0	i really thought these were the cutest bumper pads but after hearing over and over again how you should n't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication i decided it would n't be worth the risk to put them on the crib i do n't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one and even if there were i would n't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them she has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these again cute for the nursery set up pre baby but i would n't use afterwards	20

1	i bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the hungry girl website and i am glad that i did they work well in a number of different recipes are filling and add a calcium boost to the dishes i use them in for very few calories these are not pasta type noodles of course the texture is different \( softer and kind of slippery \) and they have virtually no flavor of their own they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them i probably wo n't use these noodles with european style or american style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce those types of sauces were created for grain based pastas which these are not on the other hand these noodles are fine in such asian recipes as pad thai lo mein and dan dan noodes \( basically noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce \) there are a lot of asian style recipes in cookbooks and on the internet which are fairly easy to make taste terrific and work beautifully with these noodles you can prepare yourself a real treat if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture and for a fraction of the calories you 'd eat if using regular noodles or rice in short if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles you 're likely to be disappointed but if you use them in pad thai any type of curry other asian dishes or most soups you 're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low cal low carb meal one thing when you open the bag there is a slight ammonia like odor \( it smells ammonia like to me anyway \) if you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes as per the package directions the odor really does disappear it is not a strong odor it wo n't permeate your kitchen or anything like that but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them just follow the package directions	20

1	i have been working for a major daily newspaper in baltimore for 2 decades perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography i have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography this may be long winded but it 's extensive and can be useful i received the nikon d2h camera 2 bodies total over one year ago i think i got them shortly after the d2h system was released in 2003 since then i have used them to shoot images of all types documentary sports daytime available light flash and dead of night for the paper i work for this is the only camera i work with first please read the manual there is a ton of information there and the information is terrific to begin with the d2h is highly configurable with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use \( resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera \) i 'll just punch right in to the way it feels the camera is a rather heavy beast and for some there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day like i do but the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through i 've long since given up using any camera bag all i have are a fanny pack for a 14mm 55mm teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt and the d2h 's hold the 17 35mm nikon and the 80 200mm nikon one touch or the sigma 120 300mm 2 touch shooting is a breeze the batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge i have my d2h set on iso 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower iso as often as i can because the higher isos bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation just today i purchased digital noise plug ins for photoshop to limit this and that 's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at iso 800 and above i now have little problems with capturing images in even barely limited lighting i recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an airbus at 36 000 feet over the pacific at 30 seconds wide open f 2 8 and it looks tons better than night shots via the d1h which lacked the internal digital noise filter that filter kicks in at around 1 2 second and longer exposures and can make you wait as long as your image you 've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise when you shoot this way \( and in general \) do n't simply react by cranking up iso because you will not be happy with your results the camera can be loud at over 7 frames per second it can make you obvious in a quiet room shooting sensitive situations can be testy so limit your shooting to single frames i wish this camera had an option to silence this camera but since the mirror has to raise and lower there 's no chance to do this am i happy with the d2h \? definitely yes are there improvements that can be made \? yes but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks people have been bailing out of using the nikon system and going canon which has some incredible gear i wo n't deny that but instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment learn how to use the d2h well and you 'll be much happier than ever and that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations for instance white balance this can be the best thing for you or the worst thing you 've ever dealt with depending upon how you approach it daylight grey skies dusk and dawn are easy because you can set the camera to daylight flash shadow \( for dusk and dawn times \) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark but the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue green or orange red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you do n't properly use white balance preset white balance is king here i can get grey black and white when i preset in mercury vapor light and i used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting ca n't figure there is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well ! if you do this \( and i can go on for miles here \) you 're on your way so with trying this d2h or considering it read through some of the digital d2h forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances generally those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it i can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail when you have decent light you 'll have a decent image but when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable in closing i have not been paid by anyone i have no nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that i'm giving the d2h credit where it 's long overdue	20
1	this is a superb product that used to be found on most grocery store shelves sadly they disappeared from the shelves after an extensive internet search for the product i was able to find them through amazon com and gristede 's supermarket i ordered a case and they arrived in perfect shape and just as advertised when these are gone i will certainly use this same procedure to order more	20

1	my kids love their macaroni cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand they did n't eat it all that well \( kraft really is the best \) so i decided to try to make it a little better for them follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter \( i melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster \) and add 1 3 cup milk what you 'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that kraft sells for a lot more money by adding extra milk and cheese they 're even getting more calcium my kids love it when i throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it 's so cheesy \( the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids do n't normally eat and make them taste good \) give it a try and see what you and or your kids think	20
1	i waited a long time for canon to come out with image stabilized binoculars in a 100 waterproof design these were worth the wait i bought mine specifically for a cruise up alaska 's inside passage one of our sight seeing excursions was on a 45 foot boat in heavy seas a fellow on this trip had a massive set of fujinon 16x40 gyro stabilized binoculars that sell for nearly 6 000 we spent time comparing my canon binoculars to his fujinons optically there is no comparison the canons while not as superb optically as the best leica binoculars are awfully good they are far brighter much sharper and more accurate in their color rendition than the fujinons the only reason to spend an extra 4 500 on the fujinons is if you require the absolute best image stabilization that money can buy if you are using binoculars in very severe conditions \( high seas etc \) you will get better performance with the gyro stabilization in the fujinons in 99 of applications you will get far better results with the canons though the fujinons are higher in their rated magnification the only time you 'll see a difference is under conditions where motion is severe in calmer seas \( not calm just not severe \) you will be better off with the canons the fuji 's are so much dimmer and lacking in clarity that the canons make up the magnification difference fairly quickly finally the waterproof aspect of these binoculars really is worth having on the above mentioned trip we were buffeted by rain and spray from the waves the canons functioned flawlessly without a hitch and cleaned up nicely afterwards these are one of the best products i 've ever used and lived up to their performance claims in every regard one point to note if you want the maximum battery life it is well worth buying lithium aa batteries to use with these binoculars this will greatly extend your battery life particularly in cold weather	20
0	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	20

1	i just want to put it out there audra mcdonald is an absolute genious everything she touches turns to gold and i just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record this may not be the audra that we are used to but if you listen closely she 's near by so this cd is a little less difficult vocally so what \? my favorite quality of ms mcdonald 's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing she could record twinkle twinkle little star and i would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story so if you buy this cd listen to it more than once let it grow on you let audra do her thang children let her do her thang	20

1	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	20

1	purchased this to help navigate a trip from northern michigan to south west florida and back again we took a fair amount of side trips and having this on our laptop made it easy to get to where we wanted to go there were a couple of times that we went off route but were back on route in very little time it helped us decide where to stop for fuel eat and sleep up to date information is available with an internet connection and the larger map viewing area was greatly appreciated well worth the price highly recommended to others	20
0	i bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new fodor 's is n't out yet this has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations but is n't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins the maps are not comprehensive enough \( the one for modern jerusalem did n't cover a third of the city and the one for tel aviv was tiny \) and there is not enough practical information about food hotels and getting from place to place i was disappointed	20
0	i was disappointed in this product as the bonnet was smaller than the previous dryer i was using by hot tools and had problem getting on over my large rollers after using about 5 times it stopped working i will say that it is compact for travelling but feel that it is undependable the temperature did get extremely hot so for a quick dry it was good from that standpoint i ended up purchasing another hot tools dryer a little more money but worth the price in the long run	20
1	when my daughter was born i did n't know about swaddling and it would take me hours to get her to sleep ! i would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep then put her in her crib and she 'd flail her arms wake up and cry and i had to start all over ! what a nightmare ! then i figured out that since her arms wake her it would make sense to wrap her in something so she could n't move them as much so i started wrapping her in regular receiving blankets it worked ! it became much easier to get her to sleep but then she wiggled out of those receiving blankets and wake up again when she was a little over a month old somehow i came across swaddleme blankets on the internet and immediately bought it it worked like a charm ! it was so easy to wrap my daughter in it and it stayed put my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner it would 've saved me from so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later my son was born and thankfully i already knew about those blankets from the start he goes to sleep great in the swaddleme blanket ! out of curiosity i tried to put him to sleep without this blanket and his arms wake him right away exactly the same as my daughter ! i consider this blanket one of the most important baby items you could buy it should be a must for a new mother who wants to get some sleep	20

0	i have ear gels before but none that were this cheap \( and i do n't mean cost ! \) there was no consistency in the size \( they come in different sizes but no two were the same \) and without fail every single one i tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece every one ! it did n't seem to matter if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear piece the material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance i am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere i seriously do not recommend these to anyone	20
0	hmm ok maybe it was not the best reason to want to buy this cd but i heard one of the songs on it hashkiveynu performed \( partially \) during an episode of the west wing and it sounded amazing \( it was not the same cantor as on this cd \) i am not jewish and not even very spiritual but i wanted to have that song in my collection i immediately searched the web for the info got the name of the chant and found this cd i almost purchased it without listening when i found a different site where they actually have rather long excerpts \( 2 min \) of most tracks so i listened to them boy was i relieved and disappointed at once ! relieved that i did n't buy the cd and disappointed that i could n't get the song i wanted \( i was willing to buy a whole cd for just 1 song that 's how much it impressed me \) the song sounds very little like the one from the west wing although i do believe that the site where i found the info speficially pointed to this cd as having a recording of the same song used in the show and i'm sorry to say it but the voice also does n't hold a candle to the one used on the show way too operatic as mentioned by many and harsh and even unpleasant sounding to me it took all the charm and candor right out of the song \( in the show they had a much more natural voice do the song \) i also agree that the choir does not mesh well with the soloist if anyone knows where and if i can purchase a recording of this song done by a different singer \( if it can be the one from the west wing i 'll be thrilled \) please let me know in the meantime i'm passing on this cd	20

1	works great had to remove the brown plastic fitting from the antenna wire that encased the actual metal connector to the cradle other reviews pointed this out so it was n't a big deal just had to be done carefully	20
1	i'm a big koontz fan and as is generally the case i greatly enjoyed this story it was a little strange but that 's to be expected from this author and genre that said it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book it had the curious sense of near division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not in my opionion as well connected as in many of koontz 's other books in addition the ending seemed a little hasty thus i gave it four rather than five stars that said i would gladly recommend it to a friend as i would most any of this author 's work	20
1	i think a lot of people miss the power of this movie to me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by ministries in this country even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous tv ministries today the message is still clear those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie this is certainly one of burt lancaster 's better roles and he plays it with much guesto ! if we were to look at most of the popular ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background this movie has a strong message do n't listen to the word of god from others if you must believe in the wild stories of the bible do so in your own way do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money ! even in this modern day and age the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong mr bush and the republican party used it as a means to seek re election ! everyone who is a born again christian or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country the ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the almighty \( if there is one \) still a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today	20
1	these are another neat taste experience from japan the chocobabies however contain shellac as an ingredient which kinda turned me off to them when i learned about it the stars in this set are the strawberry chocolate cone things whatever they 're called they 're delicious ! also the coffee flavored ones are excellent i'm finding i am a fan of just about anything made by meiji and this set is no exception	20
1	i havent gotten the treatment myself yet but my husband loves it dont rub it on too long or you 'll have too much it melts quickly when it touches skin i love the peppermint cinnamon mixture scent and he likes the heat it provides it leaves a coating of the buttery stuff on your skin so wear a shirt to bed so it can soak in and moisturize	20
0	i recently purchased a bean round zafu and i find it didnt live up to the claims in the least this zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised \( wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with \) first thing i thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was this thing seems nothing like the pictures it 's saggy and about half the height of all the images i 've seen of it not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift \( i weigh about 160 pounds so i dont think that weight is the problem \) i'm very dissapointed in this product the reason i bought this was not only for the reasonable price but i thought bean seemed like a quality company i payed 40 for this wich does seem reasonable it does seem reasonable that is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at i bought this product from the comfort store their probably the only internet company along with bean of course i will never buy from again unless i learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls	20
0	me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater i was bored out of my skull after about a half hour my friend who tends to be more progressive than i actually suggested we leave it was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing ever ! perhaps i'm biased however i highly recommend that no one get this movie the only reason i can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant i tend to lean to the right but even i was entertained by v for vendetta despite it being blatant liberal propaganda if you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil at least make it interesting	20
1	i bought this game because i thought it would be fun to play along with the story like in the sims2 for ds the beginning went well the operations are fun the story drags a little and goes too slow i actually skipped part of the story and just did the operations the operations get your heart pumping and are somewhat stressful i am stuck on the 6th one i have been trying to complete it for a few weeks now but continuously fail unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them in order i dont know if i will be able to play this game any further	20

0	i was a private beta tester for the new os i tested the software for a whole year and i am not pleased with it if you depend on stability for your existing software you are out of luck the hardware and software support for the new operating system is horrible many businesses will have to upgrade their hardware to use windows vista you are better off upgrading to a mac after all microsoft did steal many ideas from apple computers	20
0	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	20
0	do n't waste your time even just simply flipping through this magazine at the newstand trust me there will be no worthwhile patterns \( i mean just look at what they choose to grace their cover ! ! ! \) i have stopped hoping for even a half way decent pattern to come along during the two years or so i have seen litteraly only one knittable pattern in the last three years \( december 2004 i believe it was a lace cardigan with beaded trim \) even the articles are pointless save your time and money and get a subscription to interweave knits or vogue knitting or opt for a new magazine \( not available at all newstands in the us \) called simply knitting which is imported from the uk it amazes me that this magazine is even still in production with how horible it is ! !	20
1	very impressive though it 's a bit big for my two year old he ca n't reach the peddles yet but manages to push himself around without too much trouble i think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old or a big two year old seems solidly built very sturdy stable and sporty looking	20
0	ninety dollars for this is unbelievable for less than 15 \( that is less than one sixth the advertised price \) someone with no skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less it may not be cool but it 'll get the job done are you more interested in getting fit or having cool trendy and frivolous toys \? avoid this plastic albatross it will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years go to your local hardware store spend half an hour and 20 \( and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit \) and get what you need without supporting this craziness or just go for a walk for free save your hard earned money	20
1	for all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled that is incorrect it was the original hip hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves so unless you have an older model that was bought before 2 2005 you should have nothing to worry about this product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the baby bjorn i have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies	20
1	i 've had this pot for over a year and love it fast hot great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time i bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because i loved the looks of it and there were limited choices at the brick and mortars i read all the reviews only after i bought it the reviewers' major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking yes the plastic knob is poorly designed and is the only reason i give this pot 4 stars instead of 5 the designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob however it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot this is what i 've been doing since i bought the pot and i 've had absolutely no problems with the knob it 's unlikely you 'll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot so you can avoid burned fingertips a secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee i 've never had this problem i suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket or they are using the wrong grind it 's important with any percolator to use a percolator grind or fac 'for all coffeemakers' grind	20
0	i have bought two of these toys for my son an only child and pretty gentle on toys it has been kept in his bedroom away from his playgroup he has not even played with it regularly yet both times these toys broke within months of purchase ! ! ! yes it is fascinating and like other reviewers i 've also had some fun with it myself but i am disgusted that it broke down so easily twice there must be a reason that amazon does n't offer new ones for sale please think hard about buying a new one elsewhere unless you do n't mind looking at the 30 you 'll pay as a month or two of entertainment look to other gear toys that do n't depend upon this lousy motor	20
1	my three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection we did n't use it as a game you can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them yes the frosting wo n't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play ! box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue would buy this again great for kids with imaginations	20
1	ca n't really add much to the reviews this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older i 'll admit that when this came out in '94 i only bumped the singles it did n't grab me at the time sometime around '97 i gave it a spin and i 've been loving it ever since there are plenty of bangers on the album but classics like pour out a little liquor str8 ballin' how long will they mourn me cradle to the grave and under pressure make this album worth owning all by themselves the rest of the songs are on point too there is n't much filler on this album the production is handled by warren g nate dogg \( 1 \) the awesone yet underrated easy mo b \( 1 \) johnny j \( 1 \) jay mopreme \( 1 \) jay syke \( 1 \) stretch \( 1 \) and thug music \( 4 \) i 'd say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks the only tracks that i would call skip material are sh do n't stop and do n't get it twisted sh do n't stop is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive the production is on do n't get it twisted cool but it 's one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it \( in my opinion \) volume 1 is a passionate if at times misdirected release from the thug life camp the production is nothing short of vintage mid 90 's cali vibes it holds up very well 13 years after its release of course if you 're a tupac completist you probably have this album already but even if you 're not a pac fan this should be a part of your collection r i p tupacstandout tracks how long will they mourn me feat nate dogg pour out a little liquor str8 ballin' \( my favorite \) cradle to the grave under pressure bury me a g feat natasha walker \( of y n v \)	20

1	i bought a red ge lantern a couple of years ago i have used it for power outages walking my dogs morning and night during the winter and rarely i 've even used it for camping i have n't done any definitive studies but the battery life seems to be longer than the 16 hours ge states i find the light to be strong enough to read by during dog walks the lantern has all but been submerged in rain and it has n't phased it and it 's performance has not been affected by colder temperatures even down in the teens though i have to admit neither the dogs or i wanted to be out very long in weather that cold the workmanship is very nice i recently looked at coleman lanterns and they have gone to a flimsy plastic top the ge lantern is built very sturdily but is light enough to carry in one hand and still control a leashed dog the only downside i 've found and i do n't consider this a big issue if the lantern is knocked hard enough say you slip and fall down a ravine in the rain the batteries will slip out of place somewhat and the light will either dim or go out it is easy to fix just transfer both dog leashes to one hand turn the lantern upside down unscrew the base enough so the batteries can be settled back where they belong and tighten the base back up i would definitely purchase another ge lantern	20

0	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	20
1	i enjoyed putting this together the spacers kinda threw me until i realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf i got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the dvd shelves were n't spaced properly cd sized so i had to take it apart and redo it but that was n't too bad the spacers snap apart easily enough even for my feeble fingers it 's not terribly sturdy maybe i did n't get the poles screwed down tightly enough but as long as it 's in its permanent location holds the multimedia well i really like the way it looks bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one too	20
0	i purchased this item to record lps into my computer thru the input on this device it sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop had same experience with loud right out of the box too startled me out of my skin ! mine did n't come with any disk although the box mentions software then again i bought this from an amazon 'partner' from amazon spend your money wisely and get an imic i'm going to	20
1	this movie is great i remember watching it when i was really young im 21 now and still love it yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great its not suppose to be realistic its fiction ! i just realized too that the daughter is the girl from american pie which makes it even funnier overall this movie is pretty good if you dont care for the story atleast get it to see kim and the other chicks in the movie if you 've never seen the movie just buy it its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it for all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues !	20
0	some will mistake me for a evidence hater but i'm really not i just want the man to put some effort into what he does i'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the fans do n't expect very much or simply do n't know what good is anymore sure you can relate to what evidence is saying but you can put on a dope instrumental cd sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head have a discussion about any topic and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album i quickly get tired of the slow flow see talking and i feel like anyone can do it i do n't shell out money for things i can do myself really the only difference between him and 50 cent is content when i hear someone say slow flow my mind translates that into reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came and lot of these beats though very dope are as slow as his flow is couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like joe scudda \( i'm sorry i tried to like him but dude is simply terrible \) big pooh \( same goes for him \) and madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener the only dope guest shots come from phonte planet asia and slug yeah i know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names but i'm going to keep it honest fu real when ev actually puts his back into it he creates some dope material down with new york city is nice piece of work that has ev gettin' busy over an air tight jake one track chase the clouds away is another track where ev does his thing over a pounding alc production the standout to me had to be line of scrimmage which features ev and atmosphere frontman slug getting nice over another dope alc creation with the likes of alchemist sid roams jake one dj khalil babu and evidence himself providing dope beats i 'd have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the lp simply put i do n't recommend playing this cd while operating heavy machinery i respect ev and his whole crew \( hell i love rakaa \) but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat i can only call it the way i see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not bring on the unhelpful votes if you want but i can only recommend this to the die hard fans who should eat this one up everyone else should download this and test it out first standout tracks letyourselfgo feat alchemist phonte a moment in time feat planet asia line of scrimmage feat slug \( my favorite \) and down in new york cit	20

0	the phone is great and i knew it would be and i am a devoted amazon shopper my concern was always whether amazon was up to the daunting task of selling cell phones and service plans a concern that has proved well founded i was originally concerned because of feedback i had read on this site indicating the pearl shipped hot with an active sim which meant for those that like me were upgrading \( vs new service \) their existing phone would stop working while the new phone was en route to be fair that did not happen however i received the pearl with a sim card that the phone would not accept the instructions that are sent with the phone say that all you have to do is insert the sim turn on the phone and it will work and if it does n't work it says do n't call cingular call amazon i followed the instructions phone did n't work i called amazon at which point the csr told me that he had all my information and someone would be contacting me in 48 hours ! ! ! unfortunately i let the poor guy have it i told him what i truly believe which is that it is completely unacceptable to tell me i have to wait 2 days just to talk to someone about why my phone which is supposed to work out of the box is n't working so 5 stars for the phone itself awesome ! 2 stars for amazon they do not have the kinks worked out yet on a positive note i immediately called cingular and they resolved the problem for me on the spot \( sim was not activated in the system \)	20
0	the move is one of my favorite sci fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to dvd that i have seen there are no special features and no chapter stops this is as if they copied a video tape to a dvd i could accecpt it being full frame but if i had known that it was this cheap a transfer i would not have purchased it	20
1	amazon had the lowest price that i could find on the web also i got free super saver shippingitem was delivered within time fram estimate provided at time of order item functions well and fulfills my diagnostic needs	20
0	for the price i paid i expected much more accuracy the data it downloads from its external monitor to the pc is terrible even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database it also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall the amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount the hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically you might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later the last 24 hours shows only 2 inches of rain strange how can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24 \? seems backwards on the good side the unit is easy to set up and connects to your pc with existing ports and a cable that is provided on the bad side besides being inaccurate the analysis software is primitive and difficult to work with you are better off downloading a text file and doing analysis in excel this unit also gives eratic readings with the temperature swinging up and down up to six degrees within a twenty minute window i wanted my son to see how the temps over a 24 hour period form a bell shaped curve so much for that this is probably ok for a first time weather station for my 8 year old but i would not recommend it for any one else since this unit is not cheap one other thing it only takes a reading every 1 3 minutes so wind speed readings are hit and miss you could be getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens to read i am dissapointed and annoyed that i spent the money and it is not at least semi accurate i will tell you that i have it set up wireless if you use the enclosed hard wire connection option then you will get more frequent readings and maybe even better accuracy good luck and do your homework first	20
0	i bought this album on the strength of positive reviews and personal charts displayed on amazon com and amazon co uk these suggested that eloy 's silent cries and mighty echoes album was redolent of pink floyd and yes actually it is but only both bands at their very worst the album opens with an inept attempt at gilmouresque doodlings circa 1973 moves on to some truly rank singing with the singer 's phrasing hardly assisted by a strong german accent and thus the suspicion that he does n't understand the absurdity of the lyrics actually at times the lyrics do remind one of jon anderson at his silliest although we forgave mr anderson and yes because they were superb musicians and songwriters with silent cries mighty echoes the tunes are pooor and for progressive rock the song structures are of almost childlike simplicity that this album was made in the late seventies is extraordinary in itself it would have been appalling in 1972 to discover it was recorded in december 1978 is gob smacking unforgiveable tosh	20
1	i got this hammock back in november so i do n't know if this hammock will be good for summer but it is the perfect hammock for winter ! my fiance and i could nap in it all afternoon with a couple of pillows and a blanket in the middle of winter it is very comfortable even with 2 people on it the surface seems to be semi water resistance we left it out in the rain a few times and most of the water stay on top of the surface we just turn the hammock dump out the water and it dried under the sun in a few hours i read somewhere that the green stripes will fade over time but i can live with it	20
0	this program is average to below average in it 's abilities that said just hope you do n't need any roxio tech support why \? because roxio 's support bites ! you cannot contact anyone online or by email for help whenever their dis functional web portal web based support system traps you in an endless loop i needed an couple simples updates for a pc that is not allowed on the internet it used to be you could download roxio 's patches from any pc having internet access then burn patch s to a cd or copy to floppy jumpdrive then sneakernet the patches to the pc needing them no more what happened today was that their webpage was apparently trying to download patch a roxio product directly on my pc ezcd5 does n't exist on my pc instead of simply letting me download it somewhere like to my hard drive vs patchging it directly from their webpage to my pc which wo n't work in my case as i'm not using roxio nor have it installed on my pc apparently the morons that did the roxio webpage coding make the download patch process stop end and proceed to send the customer back to roxio 's initial patch download page when you need a patch all these endless loops and support gamesare enough to get me looking for a different product different company if you want to minimize human contact with customers fine but let folks at least download the patches they need in order to keep their pc going do n't hand over your customer support system almost completely to a web server that ignorant arrangement works about as well as when companies try to save a few pennies and get rid of phone receptionists for customer service telephone calls then they let customers wade through a 100 layer deep voicemail system to find the answer to a simple problem it just doesn't work if a company wo n't provide access to patches even after i have logged into their website with username and password so they know is accessing their patches and they do n't offer any type offtp site as a download backup option theni sure as heck wo n't be buying anymore of their products i see why roxio bought up cequadrat and other companies though i hate to see such quality companies be devoured like that when a competitor has a better product why fight to improve your prodsuct 's quality features when you can buy the other company out thank goodness nero is not under the roxio umbrella	20

0	after having great success with the merkur classic i decided to own up and get the futur i was super excited because i thought to myself shoot one pass instead of two not quite for starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy and not the kind of heavy i'm comfortable with trying to shave as i should n't feel i might drop the darn thing i started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor not a good shave missed alot of spots and patches of hair so day two i went to level 2 on the razor same story second verse it left patches and did n't shave well in some areas 2 5 the areas got smaller but still they were there went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself so for the next week i went back to a 2 5 and did it more consistantly still gave me a crappy shave i give this one star because if it 's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it there should n't be a learning curve from one double edge to another at least not one this severe i get a way better shave using my merkur classic and i really think at least for me this is the way to go i say use caution on the merkur futur i also say if you 're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have do n't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style if you 're double edge gets old buy a new one of the same kind only a suggestion	20

1	so far our 7 month old son likes this toy he watches the flashing lights listens to the music and noises and seems to like the different shaped blocks \( we have several other peek a boo blocks \) he uses the handle to push the bus flips up the shape sorter and kicks at the wheels to make the music come on it keeps his attention while he practices sitting up for long periods of time we thought at first we had a broken one since only one light worked and it did n't flash well after my husband pounded the light bar down on each side both lights came on and started flashing it also made the hood stay shut better so maybe try that before taking it back to the store if you encounter the same problem	20

1	if you 're a strummer fan who is an historical completist then you 'll want this disc also there are some really good tunes on here for anyone particularly joe 's keys to your heart some of the live material here is high quality and some is not this is likely not a cd you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh but i'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as i 've always wanted to hear it and as a joe fanatic i had to have it there 's moments here that sound like a rough draft of js and the mescaleros but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70 's with some great guitar solos if joe had not been where uk punk started after this band there 's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he 'd have kept playing in a band i'm a huge clash and strummer fan but i rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content	20

0	consider another receiver before buying delorme 's delorme 's receiver works only with their software \( the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers \) the delorme software itself is not very accurate just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly finally with the receiver i have even after the device as been initialized delorme 's software sometimes is unable to find it \( i suspect that is because the cable on the gps side sometimes pulls slightly out but fiddling with it does n't seem to accomplish much \) real irritating out on the road as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages	20
1	it 's a decent mic for just a few bucks it works adequately and has an on off switch and an xlr connector it comes with a xlr to 1 4 cord if you 're going to plug this mic into a mixer be sure to get a xlr to xlr cord the volume of the mic when connected to a mono 1 4 jack with the included cable was almost inaudible with a xlr to xlr cord it was at normal volume levels compared with other equipment	20
1	this is one of my favorite releases from common this chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers songs like i used to love h e r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks this is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone 's collectio	20

1	i have this exact same soft light green deluxe pillow i bought the pillow when she was about 2 weeks old and i have been wearing it almost all day long every day since she is 11 weeks old today she is so comfortable when nursing on this pillow the cushion is made of firm foam she falls asleep on the pillow while it is around my waist even when she 's not nursing or napping the pillow helps me to support her weight when i'm sitting or standing it fits me very comfortably even though i'm plus size the only drawback is that i need to order an additional slipcover because it can only be hung to dry although it is machine washable i really love this fabric but apparently this fabric is not available to purchase separately as a slipcover so i guess i 'll try the oatmeal twill cover	20
1	having to get a mindset and change eating habits due to health issues has proved to be a challenge but with so many snacks that can be had that are actually good for you and that taste good it has been pretty easy this item for one we love ! ! ! what they are not airy super sweet empty calories what they are please read the nutritonal chart \( so i do n't have to type it all out \) the sodium level is a good choice for those that have to limit salt intake calories are not outrageous they have a slight taste of caramel that comes from the rice syrup peanut butter they were not overly gooey they are a bit more weighty than the 'others' but it 's because there is some substance here we have learned to eat and enjoy our food at a slower pace so one will suffice vs 2 3 of the 'others' we use to scarf down in one sitting i give 5 stars as product was in date tasted fresh has a good taste nutrition worthy packaged conveniently	20
1	if you 're the type of person that does n't spend hours on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you i bought this phone in the uk at the carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great i would say that the only gripe about this phone in the us is the price i would n't pay over 40 bucks for it it 's a nice basic phone the screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones	20
1	i bought this clock for my pool deck and it works great it set itself within 10 minutes of putting the battery in i have it on a wall that has an overhang that is about 4 feet so it is protected from the weather you can see it well from across the yard have had several comments from visitors they think its a great outdoor clock the thermometer is not automatically set you need to set it it seems to work fine i have checked it a couple of times with the local temperature on the radio tv would recommend the clock to those looking for an outdoor time piece	20
0	i am writing this as a review of hippo clubs in general i purchased a simmilar set from amazon a year ago because it was a 300 set or irons reduced to 100 i was interested in the graphite shafts \( all i have ever used is steel \) and wanted a cheap set to travel with \( i have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel \) the first thing that i noticed with these clubs was my miss hits rose dramatically the clubs looked nice enough but their performance was less than par when i talked with my club pro he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to 80 each he also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs \( which was a humbling fact that i had to swallow \) and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts all of this being said i chalked up my 100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high quality pre owned clubs after 2 weeks i found a hardly used set of '04 big berthas for 359 i talked the salesman down to 299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that i have ever hit i guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs you are either a new or relatively unskilled player like me if this is the case take some time and search out high quality pre owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend 600 1000 for new sets take advantage of their trade ins that 's my opinion anyway	20

1	a man escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero 's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much delayed escape but in other respects it 's a perfectly contained and executed movie the performances are very strong \( bresson was still aiming for naturalistic performances at this time \) and the christian allegory that we want redemption but instinctively back away from it is not overstrained although this time round i noticed a few more references to religion than i recalled it 's there if you want to see it but never at the cost of turning the movie into a sermon new yorker 's source material is not especially good but considering how bad most 35mm prints that go round the revival circuit are it may well be a case of making the best of what material was available to them	20
0	i registered for the entire locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it i love the theme but the mobile was a big disappointment it did n't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available he just could n't attach it safely and we ended up returning it also although the mobile matches the theme i found that the colors were n't very stimulating we bought the tiny love symphony in motion mobile instead and although the colors did n't match our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it	20
1	this film is really excellent with a great cast and a thoughtful and frightening message we see the story of a group of high school boys graduating and then immediately joining the german army to fight in world war i the story revolves around paul baumer a thoughtful and sensitive young man who gradually sees so many horrors of war and loses so many of his friends that he is transformed into a different person a war weary pessimist with no illusions no dreams no purpose and no homeland richard thomas does a masterful job of playing paul baumer he is supported with a fantanstic cast of actors ernest borgnine plays the peasant shoe maker who leads their platoon he is an earthy fatherly survival focused man who does his best to ensure his men have food rest shelter and take no outrageous risks of glory paul learns much from this man who becomes a surrogate father and mentor ian holm plays a military school drill instructor who is a sadist eventually his sadism goes too far and he is sent to the front lines where he exhibits cowardly actions that ironically result in his receiving a medal from the kaiser patricia neal plays paul 's dying mother paul has seen so much death that he is only able to show dispassionate empathy with his mother and tells her lies about the front lines so that she does not die of cancer worrying about her son donald pleasance plays a high school instructor who fills the heads of young men on concepts of national glory heroism manhood and other nonsense to which 18 year old boys fall victim the oddessey of pain is carefully told as paul experiences one loss and disillusionment after another the tired eyes of the german infantry speak volumes as the kaiser urges them on to give their lives for the fatherland paul 's return home is a wonderful turn in the film as he finds that his father and the older fellows have no idea of the reality and horror of the war they make simplistic overgeneralized comments such as 'the war will be won if we surround them' and other such nonsense paul 's eyes glaze over as they discuss these abstractions while his young friends die in the muddy trenches paul 's best friend a gymnast and forrester dies after a leg amputation paul tells his mother a story that her son died immediately and painlessless which is far from the truth she makes paul swear by everything he holds sacred that this is the truth he does so then she makes him swear by his own safe return home that this story is the truth again he does so in this extremely painful scene we see that paul has beent totally transformed by the war he no longer believes in anything but his ability to periodically protect himself and others against random and senseless violence and pain he also realizes that he is no longer able to feel comfortable in his past or in the land of the living away from the war he returns to the front lines fully expecting that the random nature of war may soon take him exceptionally well done this is a film every family should see it is only when peopel face the reality of war rather than the abstractions that war would ever end	20

1	there are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments i weighed both before i made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments i am glad i did the light from the mirror is bright the slide bar for the different light settings works very well if you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time i enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use the only negative i have about the mirror is that the flourescent tubes buzz a little but i am getting accustomed and learning to tune them out	20
1	we purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago for perspective we are heavy travelers with 4 6 international trips year and always bring our son 's car seat along this carrier has been indispensable for us it fits our large britax roundabout plus has space for a bag of diapers soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips we use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes as our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane we simply check it through as a piece of luggage the material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread we just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well	20

0	first off i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years and enjoyed it but the main guy robert kennedy is someone who offends me both personally and politically he assumes that every girl women reading that magazine is tiny for his information some of us work out 5 6 days a week and eat well and are still heavy set his comments on heavy set people are offensive thoughtless and sometimes even downright cruel nonetheless the pictures articles were inspiring to me and it is a decent fitness magazine	20
1	i 've been trying for 2 weeks now adding 1 teaspoon to my normal shake or yogurt it dissolves easily i feel more energy throughout the morning hours what i like best is that it 's from brazil so it 's the real thing and less expensive than other brands the label was folded over a bit but that 's ok they ship fast it arrived in my mailbox in 3 days thanks amazon for offering unique items such as this my husband and i love it	20

0	i do n't know about you folks but i have small ears though the sound on these ear buds are good i ca n't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they 're too big for me and forget about trying to walk and keep them in my ears unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords good idea badly designed for size differences	20
0	i bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6 10 times over the course of 13 months it stopped working i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it ca n't be repaired i should just throw it away ! i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless ! buy one at you own risk	20
1	i have followed the enigma project for a long time and have n't found myself disappointed with a single release thus far \( that is considering i am reviewing an older album \) 'the cross of changes ' the second chapter in the enigma project offers philosophical insight into micheal cr tu 's personal beliefs in the form of an 'enigmatic' symphony of soft composition and chanson while each album seems to hold it 's own unique interpretation of life i believe the purpose of this album is to inspire love peace and wholeness within its listeners the lyrical value of 'the cross of changes' seems to surpass that of its instrumental quality which is at times rather poor in comparison to some of micheal 's other works however the lyrics are reassuring and inspiring none the less and make the entire experience worthwhile buyers who are curious about enigma probably should n't start with this album as it seems to be one of those things you appreciate only after hearing some of the latter releases \( in my case at least \) the first album i purchased was 'love sensuality devotion' \( the greatest hits album \) a good start considering you will get a fair idea of what enigma is all about by the way i am curious about track number 2 everytime i listen to it i faintly hear sandra chanting open your heart and push the limits in the background though it could just be my imagination it 's strange that i mention that because 'push the limits' was released after this album	20
1	this magazine has great recipies ! most of them are incredibly easy but there are a few adventuresome ones every once in a while to try when you feel up to a challenge sometimes the recipies need a few more spices so i usually add more than they say \( heck it does n't change the calorie count \) however cooking light does not trade calories for taste so the whole family likes the meal and there are many recipies that i would proudly serve to company \( the majority in fact \) there are also just a ton of recipies per issue the only negative things i would say is that a few of the recipies are only marginally healthy and sometimes there 's some redundancy overall it 's a great buy	20

1	wow okay so i was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because i didnt read the dimensions before i bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size this is about half the size of an ipod mini it is by no means big read the dimesions well before you purchase the photos are really good quality and clear just small lol	20

0	i bought this game on a whim having really liked need for speed hot pursuit 2 this game needs help first of all the frame rate is lower than it should be there is slow down as well even the game before this need for speed underground 2 looked 100 times better the car models in most wanted are a touch nicer looking and there is a far better selection than underground 2 but that 's the only plus this game has to it you do n't race as much as fly around the city in a barely controlled frenzy trying to stay ahead of the computer cars winning is more by luck than skill he or she who hits the least obstacles wins hardly an enjoyable way to race ! i get too stressed when playing this game so i put it away for a while definitely rent before buying this game	20

1	heavens harps and wings are nice but what a showman extraordinaire florenz zigfeld jr \( 1869 1932 \) wants most now when hes no longer on earth is to put on another extravaganza it would have the brightest stars and creative talents the most in glamour gams and optimism in short it would be like ziegfeld follies with a whos who of credited and uncredited hollywood talents this all star revue is heaven to fans of musicals fred astaire \( 1899 1987 \) dazzle once twice four numbers in all red skelton \( 1913 1997 \) reprises his funny guzzlers gin skit esther williams \( 1922 \) swims lena horne \( 1917 \) sings and judy garland \( 1922 1969 \) spoofs snobbery theres verdi \( giuseppe f verdi 1813 1901 \) opera and fanny brice \( 1891 1951 \) vauderville patter and pantomine and the babbit and the bromhilde with gene kelly \( 1913 1997 \) joining fred astaire in their first ever screen pairing what a show ! the man called flo must be proud high quality transfer features not remastred recommende	20
1	immediately upon starting dickens' our mutual friend i was struck by parallels with dumas' the count of monte cristo both big novels revolve around a powerful character who conceals his identity in a complicated plot to obtain social justice the count deals with the darker theme of revenge our mutual friend is an exploration of the corrupting influence of wealth the novel is lively throughout as dickens displays his tremendous diversity of writing talents the tone ranges from heavily ironic criticism of upper class politics and antisemitism to delicate romance to witty visual humor the characterizations are highly original even those at the extremes of vice and virtue display engaging ideosyncracies most impressive to me was the consistency of dickens' plot our mutual friend was written and published in installments as was the count of monte cristo but dickens keeps his story on track throughout never dropping a character while dumas' tale is full of gaps and inconsistencies	20
1	they 're cool some break to easily but others dont it does not feel like you are wearing a watch and they are very small its just like i said they break easily but i would give it 4	20

1	i purchased this at a photographic store because a professional said you should n't go higher than 1 4x just keep in mind 1 4x is only 40 better it worked really well but did n't increase the zoomage enough i decided to go with a 2x \( that 's twice the zoomage \) teleconverter by kenko instead i gave this one to my brother in law for christmas you have to think about what you want i want to get in really close to the birds i have a 70 300mm zoom lens and 1 4x takes it to 98 420mm it is an improvement but not nearly enough ! if you want to get twice as close this is n't going to do it for you if you want to get half again as close this almost gets you there as far as quality the quality is definitely there five stars for quality 3 for insufficient zoomage	20

1	this item saves space because it folds everything to the same size it is god 's gift to those of us who have small closets and hate messes i first saw it when a clerk at a store was using it to put clothes back on the floor for sale i tried to buy it off her and she told me the name of the company i love the flip fold you wo n't be sorry if you buy this item	20

0	i loved the incredibles so i was excited to play the game i 've only been playing video games the last couple years and only off and on so i'm really just a beginner perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty i 've had with this game my boyfriend is a long time video game player and he was able to do things in one or two tries that i labored for hours over even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much i was surprised when i read the review that said the game was too easy i almost cried lol but seriously unless you are a good gamer you 're probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game as for me i guess i 'll stick to action rpgs	20

0	the other boleyn girl and the queen 's fool are two of the best books i 've ever read and i 've read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin 's lover fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it 's channeled from another source and times when it 's harder more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced constructed i'm going back to trollope	20

1	i have arthritis \( psoriatic \) diabetes high blood pressure heel spurs and osteopenia \( a pre osteoporosis state \) and i'm 240lbs a real grab bag of conditions to deal with ! i saw what happened when my mother broke her hip and i really did n't want to have that happen to me but how to exercise \? using a warm therapy swimming pool was about the only exercise i could do and that will not provide the weight bearing exercise needed to re form bone just walking around is cheap but i'm a female and my neighborhood is not really well lit and has gone downhill a bit too i just did n't feel safe walking around at 2 am or whenever i was up for exercise besides there were hazards like uneven pavement high curbs and all the issues of weather to deal with i had seen the ads on tv for the gazelle line of exercise equipment and it seemed to be ideal for me i could exercise my knees and hips in regular gravity conditions or add resistance if i needed to without any arthritis taunting up and down impact on my joints no more worries about where i was stepping and into what i could exercise whenever i wanted and not disturb anyone in the neighboring apartments i could go as far as i liked and would n't have to worry about being exhausted from going too far from home and not being able to make it back so i got the gazelle and i love it ! i chose this model \( the power plus \) for my use but also because my best friend is 340lbs and this will take up to 350lbs from the way it is constructed which is very strong and solid i'm not sure that 's really it 's upper limit this is not some flimsy cheaply constructed rip off it does not move sway or walk when i use it yet with the handles on the side i'm able to lift the back of the gazelle up onto the front wheels and move it fairly easily which really suprised me since it is such a heavy duty machine any downsides \? it did have a small bit of squeaking at first but it never got to the point where i 'd be worried that i was disturbing anyone because it is built so solid it does command a bit of space not too much but it is not a model that will fold up so you 'll need to commit room for it and enough room for the swinging motion i 'd want to safety fence off around it to protect pets and kids from getting too close when it 's in action over all i am very pleased with this item ! well done fitness quest	20
1	i really like my first leap pad and so does my 3 year old son i bought it for him for christmas last year \( he was 2 1 2 then \) and though some the activities we 're alittle hard for him to start with there were still plenty of things he could do with it every picture you touch the pen on says a frase says the name of the object or make a sound so even without playing the games he still had great fun with it a year on he can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed letters make words so now he touches the words and the leap pad reads it for him so he is still learning from this toy after a year ! i will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this christmas this toy is worth every penny	20

0	eliot cohen has an impressive background in policy work \( osd \) and academia \( naval war college and harvard \) i had high hopes for this book because i thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well grounded work i was disappointed i never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals he seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold i could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way the article might have made a good article in a foreign affairs journal but the author seemed to fill out the book with a lot of interesting but not really relevant historical stories and facts the lincoln chapter providing nothing that has not been stated numerous times in more detailed and focused work the churchill chapter was the best cohen obviously has extensively studied churchill his sections on how the historical view of churchill have ebbed and flowed over the years was well done thought not rally tied to the focus of the book i learned the most from the ben gurion since i knew the least about him the book may be useful to an undergraduate class studying political leadership or foreign policy but beyond that the book unfortunately offers little that is new or of great interest	20

1	i decided to get this office suite after using it recently i 've usually worked on office 97 and 2000 but the 2003 version has some pretty cool features not found in the older versions the feature that i really enjoy is the pivot report feature in ms access which was n't in ms access 2000 this is a truly great reporting feature you can now use access as a front end to slice and dice data stored on data warehouses in oracle sql server sybase and other enterprise type databases if you 're used to creating crosstab reports you 'll definitely like the pivot report feature crosstabs are limited to 2 dimensions but there 's no limitation on the number of dimensions in pivot report to me the main drawback is the price \( i did get mine at around 370 at j r which is a great price \) i figure i can upgrade this in about 5 years time which works out to about 70 to 75 per year \( assuming that i 'll be paying about 370 to upgrade in 5 years time \) a big positive is that this is the industry standard so the work you put into learning the multiple new features of word excel ms access is not wasted because you can reuse the same skills in another job your time will be well spent note that the software may seem bloated but the intelligent user is able to choose and pick the most useful and relevant features of each application and ignore the features that are not useful different features are useful to different people another positive each product in office professional is fully programmable using visual basic for applications \( vba \) which you can use to build custom programs this very powerful feature is sometimes overlooked when shopping for office suites	20
1	the bottle itself is a real looker with thick rich smooth glass encasing golden rich amber jewel like liquid on the inside fancy shmancy i said as i took it out of the delivery box i opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my it 's definitely worth the price tag the real test of course came at bath time and this sure delivered beyond looks alone the bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm primrose vanilla and the rich juicy and creamy finish of the apricot this should be eaten not bathed in ! insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative but better yet for yourself apparently this can be used as a body wash and i am really looking forward to using it in the shower as i'm a shower person in the morning and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure i have reviewed a few of these bath items today and now i feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that i feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath it 's little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub even my boyfriend loved the scent as he used it the other day so it can be for both men and women but i might have to hide it in case he secretly likes it too much !	20
1	purchased for a christmas gift the larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed he had the orignial a scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction he was also wanting the wheely kick bar over the back wheel overall the a3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying the razor kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat can just be one more thing to break in my opinion price on amazon could n't be beat price was by far the best from a host of on line sites i checked shipping was great deal and came quickly within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before christmas ! in the word of my son santa be very very good to me !	20
1	this is a great controller especially after all the complaints microsoft had got about its original controller being too bulky \( personally speaking i never really had problems with even that \) but since i got xbox controller s i havent touched the big one this controller gives a better grip buttons are softer and their positioning is better \( the overall feel is quite good \) i played rallisport challenge with this controller and beat the whole game even in a game like rallisport where precision is required in accelaration and braking to successsfully master the tracks i did it without any problems using this controller also the vibration feel is very good so if you are looking to buy an xbox controller and are not being able to decide which just go for this smaller one controller s without any hesitation quality hardware	20

1	seventeen year old catherine morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things dancing dressing and reading sensational novels but doing these things wo n't get you a husband or acquaint you with other young ladies such as yourself so upon request from a neighbor catherine is invited to spend some time in bath a fashionable town where catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature who are not related to her and that is where the naive catherine meets up with the thorpe family quickly becoming friends with isabella thorpe catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious yet conniving family and it is only when catherine is rescued by henry tilney along with his charming sister eleanor and whisked off to their ancestral home known only as northanger abbey there catherine 's choice of reading material mysteries and ghost stories that is comes back to haunt her for northanger abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night such as creaking and frightening winds that leave catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself the fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors and a curious history only heightens young catherine 's suspicions and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within northanger abbey and the tilney family in general jane austen has been a favorite of mine since i was very young but it was not until this past weekend that i happened upon northanger abbey while browsing through the bookstore and decided to purchase it i will admit that hands down this has become one of my favorite austen books catherine is an enchanting character whose innocence and naivete make her charming from beginning to end while her overactive imagination leaves the reader chuckling in delight at the many crazy notions she creates within that bright head of hers catherine 's interactions with isabella thorpe and the rest of the thorpe family are intrepid and truly make you feel strong emotion towards those particular characters while the charming henry tilney like mr darcy makes you root for a romance to blossom between our dashing businessman and our young heroine a wonderful satirical piece of fiction that should certainly be discovered by anyone who calls themselves an austen fan erika soroccobook review columnist for the community bugle newspape	20
1	this is a great item but it does have some flaws i got this for my 2 month old and he loved it ! now he 's 6 months and loves it just as much the thing is you need to manually push the button and then you can use the remote after it plays all the music and it shuts off the only way to turn it back on is to press the button yourself not great when you 're flying on the freeway ! but it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on	20

1	i purchased this lens back in march of 2005 to shoot static warhammer models with my 10d i found that longer lenses such as the sigma 105mm the canon ef 100mm and the tamron sp autofocus 90mm all were too long with the 10d 's 1 6 focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what i had room for to get the shot the canon ef 50mm f 2 5 is nearly a perfect match with the 10d for this purpose its small its compact and its short focal length do not require that i be standing three feet away from the model i'm shooting as far as shooting at non static objects such as insects the lens is slow to focus and loud in both noise and vibration which results in startled subjects and missed shots the same also applies for non macro shots as well its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well	20

0	i 've had my vacuum for a few years now only b c i'm too lazy to buy another one however i am at the end of my rope from day 1 of having this vacuum the belt broke frequently and most of the time i was vacuuming on hardwood if i accidentally ran over a cat toy or piece of string or anything bigger than a crumb the belt broke i took to buying lots of extra belts whenever i went to the store the other day surprise the belt broke for no apparent reason i promptly replaced it and it broke again the minute i turned the vacuum on i say no more i am now determined to buy the best vacuum ever i do n't care how much it costs ! ! the only nice thing about this vacuum is the ability to use to the hose attachments without having to flip a switch and it is pretty powerful but that 's it changing the cannister can be messy and like a few other reviewers i frequently run over the cord something just was n't designed right there you 've been warned	20
0	pro compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket yet opens to a comfortable working size with full sized keys including a number row for those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets this is decidedly a deal maker over the stowaway keyboard which requires alt key combinations to access numbers and symbols the full size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the freedom keyboard to my knowledge there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has both full size keys and a number symbol row the bluetooth connection is clean lag free and accurate con the software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement \( see below \) flimsy locking mechanism not usable on a lap the manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat while on your lap or on a non flat surface this lock is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip which travels 7 8 along the top of the board from the left half into the right even when locked the keyboard does n't lay flat and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user 's legs held in place only by one thin piece of wire the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated v shape after any amount of light handed typing hp could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics a user must find a solid flat surface to type on such as a book and of course when sitting on a flat surface the lock is n't needed the manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your pocketpc unfortunately the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non removable cradle a quick look at the freedom keyboard 's pull out cradle offers hp a lesson in how to do it right the keyboard ships with no case as do most other portable keyboards with non rugged exteriors the attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys it does n't turn off yes you read that last bullet correctly you ca n't turn this thing off there 's no power switch the button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld it 's not a power switch what this means is even when folded and not in use even when appearing to be dormant and even when the software shows that there 's no bluetooth connection the keyboard is still eating your batteries the automatic sleep mode simply disables the wireless connection it does not power down the keyboard two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard you 'll return to find them dead not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes the only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries the battery cover need i add breaks easilly sound unbelievable \? go to the major websites dedicated to pocketpcs and do a search of their forums using the keywords bluetooth keyboard this is not a case of a know nothing customer who needs to read the manual the manual such as it is makes no mention of an absent power switch for the mobile user then in addition to the keyboard itself one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired to carry the batteries separately and to re enter the access key into the software after reinserting those batteries although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use the hp ipaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1 3 it 's 100 retail price and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full size keys and number row how hp ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me all potential buyers of ipaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what if any emphasis hp places on quality of design and the integrity of ipaq name it reflects also the degree of respect hp has for the intelligence of their customers one might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non removable cradle or the parsimony of not including a case one might even forgive the useless locking mechanism but when hp is either too dumb to include an on off switch or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care then i must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the ipaq name if hp is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for 100 then i cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a pocketpc for 300 400 my next handheld upgrade i 'll probably stay with fujitsu siemens loox \( i currently use a loox720 a truly excellent ppc \) or maybe go with a dell axim i wo n't even consider an ipaq the hp bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality those at hp responsible for protecting public perception of the ipaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves	20

1	this sparkling juice really holds up to the description it has the perfect amount of carbonation \( not too much not too little \) is crisp to the taste and is very refreshing the 8 oz cans sounded pretty weak but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting since first tasting martinelli 's sparkling apple cider at a new year 's celebration over a decade ago i 've been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks but none have been just right naturally i 've tasted the types that i 've come across over the years including martinelli 's sparking cider \( which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption \) martinelli 's sparkling apple juice \( a bit under carbonated \) apple beer \( non alcoholic good but has a slightly odd taste \) appletiser \( uk only good but uk only \) and a few other local organic brands all of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion but seriously none compare to essn 's sparkling fuji apple juice yeah it is a little pricey but its worth it	20

0	i really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is not the motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working you wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again but by the time you are getting results in one area of your foot the thing heats up and stops working again i went through four intervals of effective operation heat build up causing it to quit waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again finally i decided it is n't worth the time and aggravation even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked one more thing when i gave up and decided to return it i took my duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot i worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot running motor i 've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this update found something much betterafter returninng the artemis i tried the medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance this one costs 5 times the price of the artemis but is soooo much better it is well worth it the medicool is plug in electric and has much more power than the battery operated artemis it has variable speeds 5 different sapphire filing attachments and enough power to operate as long as you need the sapphire files are different shapes and sizes and should last a lifetime whereas the artemis requires repeated purchases of its disposable filing heads and batteries so over time the costs of owning the artemis will add up if the overly hot motor does not burn out if you have serious callouses and corns like i do the medicool pedisenso will do a very serious rewarding job i'm so glad i found it and i am grateful for the relief it provides	20

0	we have the all clear swing gate \( hardware mounted not pressure mounted \) installed at the top of our basement stairs earlier this evening i opened the lock and as the gate swung out over the stairs the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand fortunately enough of my weight was behind me that i was able to correct my balance \( just ! \) and did not fall headfirst down the stairs but it was a close thing an inch or a pound or a second either way and i or god forbid one of our children would certainly have been badly injured while i was taking a photograph of the broken hinge the gate itself which was hanging precariously by its remaining hinge fell off and tumbled down the stairs the gate has been in place for six weeks but has only been in actual use for a tiny fraction of that time as we have been out of the house for five of those weeks nb this was a product failure not an installation fault the screws are still firmly attached to the wall along with what remains of the plastic flanges around the appropriate holes in the hinge i purchased the gate after reading the enthusiastic reviews here but after my experience tonight i would not recommend that anybody buy this gate ever \( the review gives one star because no stars is not an option \) and i would expect to see a product recall very soon	20

0	i really really really really like allison moorer have been a fan since her first record have road tripped to see her numerous times and love her songwriting and singing that said getting somewhere is by far the least satisfying of her records no memorable songs over produced no guts as another reviewer said when the allison moorer doyle butch primm songwriting team called it quits \( in more ways than one \) their lennon mccartney caliber teamwork was lost not that moorer sounds like the beatles but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music this cd is not only unmemorable but i doubt i would care to ever listen to it again such a shame i 've never had anything negative to say about allison in the 8 years i 've been a fan but this cd left me cold it hurts a bit to say this but i cannot recommend this cd the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b story line from an episode of the larry sanders show in that episode sanders' head writer phil \( played by wallace langham \) finally got himself a girlfriend and was happy as a result he lost his edge when he was a miserable person he was an edgy cynical funny jokewriter when he was a happy person he stopped being the kind of funny that he needed to be to do his job same with moorer since her recent changes in her social life she has started singing a sweeter tune in her life but it came with a cost she does n't seem to be the same songwriter anymore and it was that other songwriter who was so good a little edgy sad sometimes bitter or at least that 's how i interpreted it granted that was n't her entire oeuvre but it is what made her songs special for me now she 's happy and she might as well be writing songs for barney the dinosaur	20

0	the panasonic is very compact very stylish sexy as my wife called it but the photos are very disappointing they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa the colours are good and it does take very good videos but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2 of course it is easy to understand why the native resolution of the images if one investigates such things will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi same as sony 's canon improves this to 180 and nikon is at 300 dpi it is not just about megapixels folks but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model do yourself a favour try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format take the photos pop the sd card into the computer compare the images in photoshop enlarge to full pixel size \( 100 \) and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself that is what i did since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d lux3 10mp camera and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store but it was very educational for them too	20
1	as one might suspect gta san adreas has the classic anarchist fun with insane driving guns galore and a lawless protagonist and a linear storyline let 's be honest though nobody buys gta to just play the mission part and in fact i have a hard time getting into the missions in san andreas there is an even larger area of gameplay and a few other cities to explore once you have advanced in the game \( unless you want to cheat \) the clear aspect that sets this game apart from the previous ones is the depth of gameplay haircuts and tattoos are available for purchase you have various parts of your character that can be built up fat hunger muscle driving skill weapon skill etc obviously when you get fat you need to run around and eat when hungry the others are self explanatory some new and rather interesting vehicles ave been added to this game the hydra which is a harrier type jet the stunt plane an attack helicopter a four wheeler a parachute and my favorite the jetpack other than that the game is like each created before it from gta 3 on the graphics even on a fairly modern computer still leave much to be desired whatever engine they use is clearly the same as gta 3 animation on the other hand is very natural and realistic music from the radio stations is lackluster but i believe it is possible to use your own music instead as a computer game san adreas' controls at the very least awkward because of the sheer number of actions that can be done in the worst case scenario the hydra however using a keyboard to fly the plane is downright nerveracking if you want to shoot something below you be sure to compensate by a couple of seconds not because it moves fast but because you need that time to angle the nose of the plane in that direction i myself use an xbox controller which has an adapter to use the usb port on the computer even with that it is not much better and you still need the d pad to make decent turns as you can tell this is my biggest qualm with the game overall grand theft auto san andreas has a lot to offer if you do n't have a regular gaming console but that is compensated by the clumsy keyboard controls i would rate it a 7 out of 10	20
1	once my best friend described my bra size as beige meaning that when you shop in the full figure section of a department store you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny 's closet most of the bras are beige with some black or white ones and all are gigantic and ugly if this sounds familiar to you then this is the bra for you it looks pretty comes in a variety of colors and i at least was able to jump up and down while wearing it with no negative consequences the cups do the supporting so the bra does n't need to have those super wide heavily padded straps and it gives a good silhouette under clothes but will also look nice by itself	20
1	while i think some of the reviews of xenosaga ii are a little harsh they have hit on a few good points in terms of plot the first thing that really let me down was kos mos do n't let her face covering the cover of the game fool you while being one of the main characters in the first game she hardly does anything in this game until the end which seems less like a plot point and more of the creators obliging her the same can be said for shion as well this shift from center stage hurts these characters and it 's really disappointing instead jr takes center stage instead of shedding light on events in the first game it opens up a whole knew set of issues that really do n't get resolved if you 're looking for the story pull that the first game had it 'll be hard to find in this game jr is a character that i personally do n't care much about but if you are a fan of him then you 'll enjoy this game as you learn a lot about his past as a u r t v a new character that is introduced is shion 's brother jin uzuki personally i liked jin but you do n't get to use him much in the game with him shion jr and albedo there is an underlying theme of brothers or siblings in the story although do n't look for much elaboration on jin and shion although some people are n't pleased with the battle system in this game i actually enjoyed it i caught into it quicker than the first game 's system you can also acquire a skill that points out the enemies' weak zones which i found very useful i also liked being able to build up attacks and then boost to really slam the enemy overall it 's a game i really enjoyed the game has some replay value to it and there are certain things that you actually ca n't accomplish until you 've beaten the game once at times re watching certain scenes over and over again gets boring yet i would recommend this series as if nothing else it serves as a bridge between the first game and the upcoming third game	20

1	i had a palm tx which i loved but did n't like having to go to wifi sites for the web i also had a moto v557 phone which is the best cell phone i 've ever owned i purchased the treo for the best of both worlds i like the treo 680 but i had to read all of the instructions call customer service and practice using certain features to not be frustrated with the phone for example i had difficulty answering the phone using the touch screen and had to practice pressing the small send button \( which i usually missed while in a rush to answer the phone \) i like the web because it 's fast enough that i do n't miss the wifi i had to get used to the fact that many web sites are n't small enough for the phone but it 's excellent for using google maps looking up business and giving the number for easy dial \( just tap the blue line \) checking bank accounts online orders movies weather and especially the news email is good too with the palm software i did n't use express or getgood email i absolutely love the chat setting on the messaging now the phone is another story i miss the ease of dialing a traditional cell my bluetooth does not work well with the 680 people typically tell me that they ca n't hear me so i now use a corded ear bud the bluetooth does n't work with the voice dial feature that is purchased separately you ca n't insert hard pauses with phone numbers that require you to dial extensions there is no way to delete one digit at a time if you misdial a number you have to leave the phone dialing page and return to redial the phone dials slowly if there are other programs running and lastly you ca n't check your calendar or other features after answering the phone if the key pad was locked when you answered the phone you have to hang up with the person unlock the phone check the calendar and call them back the battery life is poor but i keep a charger in the car which helps a great deal all in all i love my treo 680 i have purchased additional software that i strongly recommend they are launcher x \( excellent \) mobil write treo voice dialing the oxford dictionary and thesaurus scrabble and mars needs cows i also recommend that you keep you treo locked with a security password i have not found a carrier that will offer insurance on this 400 phone	20
1	whenever my eczema flared up my friends would tell me i'm too stressed out i did n't feel that way not much more stressed out than usual so the timing of the flare ups and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing after reading this book however i recognized it 's much more than just the simple stress more deeply rooted issues i 've apparently held for a long time i had vaguely suspected this may be the case but did n't know how where to start this book gave me the guidance to do that on my own i agree with 3 other reviewers completely i no longer feel helpless and scared when i can feel my skin starting to flare up i am not yet free from eczema but knowing what may be the underlying cause of it and how to calm it down i have much stronger sense of being in control of my skin body and my life	20
1	i purchased this nokia 5300 black at the t mobile store it does come with 1 gb memory card and i was able to easily load up 160 songs last night with no problems phone comes with usb cable to connect to your computer i have a mac so this was easy to do you will not be able to download songs bought from itunes but you can load up aac files and mp3 and mp4 you can hold up to 500 songs if they are all 3 5 minutes long and compressed to 128 kps my music is usually remixed and or longer than 3 5 minutes each i was n't able to sync up with bluetooth to my ibook but i was able to pair with my motorola t305 that i will be using in my car apple has not approved the nokia 5300 yet to sync i am sure it is a matter of time since the phone is rather new overall i love the feel of this phone has wonderful 2 in screen color is great camera is cool and it is very intuitive to use i have been with samsung over the last three years and i was concerned about going back to a nokia however the speakerphone is absolutely great compared to the motorola 195 that i originally got but returned once you load up your songs the speaker is impressive this morning i had the phone playing music in one part of the house and i had to go get something at the other end of the house and i could still hear the music perfectly calling on the phone was better than expected i was talking to my friend during busy traffic and lots of people background noise and i was able to carry on a pleasant conversation with her unlike my samsung that was difficult to do this with the phone is quite sturdy and i am happy to have a phone that not everyone has a motorola razor this nokia 5300 looks a bit chucky compared to that phone but i feel like i have a very unique phone that is more than a phone who needs an ipod mini when you can get this and your phone all in one \? i just ordered the boxwave frost case for this phone there is very little to chose from at the t mobile store as far as accessories and nokia com did n't have much either the alarm feature to wake up is cool too you can choose to wake up to your favorite song that you have downloaded and you can program it to slowly increase the volume of the song for your alarm it also comes with programmable snooze what a dream ! you can make calls without even having to slide the phone to dial as long as you have the number you want already stored in your phone book then all you have to do is look up and press the green button ! when you are playing your music if an incoming call comes in it will stop playing the song and then alert you with the normal ring tone that a call is coming in once you are done with the phone call you can resume playing your music as i said this phone is a gem in all areas speaker sturdy colorful i think it is contemporary and an acquired taste for sure but nonetheless appealing call quality is great even in loud areas and lots of little creature comforts definitely consider this phone if you really like to have music and bluetooth and speakerphone else this may not be the phone for you	20
0	it 's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer yeah maybe my fish can get a record deal they sing in tone can breath but refue to lip synch \( i know it sounds gay \) this is just sad because bands that play their own instruments write their own songs and perform their own songs can pretty much get almost no attention let 's take the band king 's x doug pinnick \( vocals bass \) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about god \( king 's x is a christian band \) ty tabor \( guitar vocals \) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably do n't know and jerry gaskill \( drums vocals \) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns yet only like a few dozen people \( i know a lot more people than that like kx i'm just exagerating \) seem to like this band it 's sad if you want good music listen to the band i just menioned \( king 's x if you were n't paying attention \) \( if amazon does n't post this i will seriously get poed !	20
1	i bought this mount for a philips 42 plasma tv the tv weighs probably about 100lbs i thought the price for it was ok but i do n't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts the mount was put on our living room wall by a handy man because i did n't have a stud finder he was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic the mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured the 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the tv sits a little high but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house the room for the input cables is a little small and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but have n't noticed any degradation in the signal none of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way so its not of a concern i took the cables and made a 1 trunk of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories the tv sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt i rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong it also looks nice and stays well hidden its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the tv easy \( i had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables \) i am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product	20

0	while this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses i cannot recommend it to other readers the author unfortunately perpetuates the right wing republican only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical christianity she battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel indeed in reading some of the chapters it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a christian worldview that might veer in any part from republican platform positions this is really too bad because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions i would not have begrudged her political point of view at all had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position	20

1	overall the product is great i have had the watch for nearly three months now and have had no problems with it the quartz movement is very accurate the chronograph works very well and i use the alarm every day the only drawback is that you have to reset the date on months that are less than 31 days otherwise this watch is fantastic and with the eco drive you never have to worry about repacing the battery and the titanium version is so lightweight that you hardly notice that you are wearing a watch	20
1	i picked this up along with zelda when buying the wii this game is not for those who like realistic driving games the physics are nothing short of just silly insane but it is so fun ! i love how you get stars for nice crashes and running other trucks off the road the action is fast and the driving is very intuitive \( provided you use the tutorials they teach you all the stunts \) it 's not too hard anyone can play and it 's just fun i love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me highly recommended do n't overlook this game !	20

0	you talk about disappointed this is the icing on the cake all i hear about is how scary and cutting edge this was not even close whatever big shot film critics say that are truly wrong i love older movies too and am open minded to the change in times and such there are actually some scary or at least entertaining horror flicks during the 70 's but this is not one of them seriously do n't buy this i do n't know why it is so highly regarded the acting story and especially the music is el terrible' it 's like porn quality acting a story written in about 25 minutes and music from a disney movie it could have been a good movie if they would have taken out the attempt at comedy through in some disturbing music and made the bad guys well more bad it could be remade \( which i'm usually against \)	20

1	when i picked up a recent issue of natural home i was pleasantly surprised i enjoyed the magazine so very much ! if you get a chance to flip through it and want validation for your salvage instincts and your love of great design you may find it just as inspirational from the article about adding pretty \( and smart \) shutters to the interior of a home for cold winter nights \( they go under the window treatment and help increase the r ratings for insulating any window against the cold this technique has been used in other countries for centuries \) the use of ventilation and healthy air is already an obsession of mine and getting rid of clutter by thinking about things we own and the spaces we put them in a new way was refreshing try this project appeals to the use it do n't just throw it away ! girl in me finally designing the structure of a house around its usability is something that i really like there is so much wasted space in today 's new construction i really do n't understand it natural home challenges you to create something new out of what you already have a breathe of fresh air	20

1	i bought one of these on a whim when the product launched just before christmas 2006 it seemed like a perfect if unnecessary stocking stuffer for my wife since we 're both wine enthusiasts i never really felt these gimmick aerators did much that a solid 1 2 hour decanting could n't do boy was i wrong the device itself is attractive compact and solidly built it appears to be a simple oblong plexiglass funnel with a rubber grip there are two small channels in the center of the funnel which look like cracks in the plastic \( i 've read product info that assures worried buyers these cracks are proper and unavoidable \) wine is poured through the top of the funnel and immediately a suction sound is heard as the pouring draws air into the wine before it escapes out the bottom of the funnel the aerator is easily held and i 've never had a problem with spills now on to the effect of the vinturi i 've been using the vinturi for 5 months now on a variety of wines from a bottle of two buck chuck to a nice '98 vietti barolo to a bottle of 97' phelps insignia in every circumstance with every wine i 've noticed a significant improvement in the quality of the wine when poured through the vinturi as opposed to tasted directly from bottle the flavours are more blended the finish is less acidic and frankly it has made most of the wines i drink a more pleasurable experience from sniff to swallow i 've conducted several blind tastings with friends and we all agree this thing works if you 're a serious wine drinker or shopping for a wine drinker in your life give this product a try at 40 it 's about the price of a decent california cabernet and will yield results for decades to come i plan on picking up a few dozen this christmas and giving them out as gifts to business clients	20

1	i have been reading health off and on since i was in high school in the late 1980s and overall i love this magazine ! the articles are usually rather interesting and there is always at least one long article that i find relevant to my life or curiosities however there are times when the topics articles border on resembling cosmo and glamour rather than really being related to health overall i recommend health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health related issues but do n't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article	20

0	normally i wouldnt write a review but i have had numerous experiences with this camera that i thought i would share my sister first bought the camera and i was amazed with how user friendly it was and i thought the pictures turned out pretty well shortly afterward her screen blacked out without any great impact or weather damage naturally i assumed it mustve gotten bumped in the wrong way tough luck i then proceeded to buy one for myself and a couple of months after i had it my screen also inexplicably failed to work and then for christmas my sister received a replacement camera for her broken one and yet again shortly after purchase the screen was broken i do accept some responsibility for the damage i imagine that if it was in a purse in a bookbag perhaps it got rattled around a bit but three times \? i dont find this to be a coincidence and i do not reccomend that you risk your money because you too may have to replace it after 3 months	20

0	our three year old twins received two of these cars for christmas the joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on christmas day ! my husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that the other cars' joystick control broke ! so now we are stuck with two broken cars and one that does work but are wondering when that one will break too ! i need to mention that the kids were not particularly rough with the cars we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior the controls are cheap and will break eventually the cars are very loud but on the positive side the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them i would definitely not recommend this product	20

1	what has happened to the song lives in the balance on this set \? if you go to his website it sounds really great ! ! ! on this set it sounds awfull ! ! it sounds as if he was in a really big hurry to get the song over with the packaging if you could call it that is really lame foam dots for holders \? what do you do when those fall off \? i suppose you put the cd 's in jewel cases or else they will get really scratched up not to mention it is missing some of his greatest work ! true you do get alot of songs for the money but there should have been more time planning this set out before actually producing it if you own an i pod i suggest you go to apples i tunes web page and import the great songs this set is missing as well as the others you really like off of this set and you will probably have spent the same amount of money if not less	20
0	i bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car i thought the lights and music would distract him after about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing i have decided that i would really rather hear my son cry it is far less irritating the remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work what genius engineered that \? also it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes do n't waste your money ! !	20
0	i am an experienced office user i recently updgraded from office 2003 \( which worked great \) to office 2007 and now i am much less productive office 2007 is pretty but if you actually have to get something done at work don't buy this product	20
0	falling in love is one of my favorite scents ever it 's basically my go to fragrance for everyday if you 're a fan of this scent you already know it 's really pretty but very light that 's why i was exited about the solid for touch ups on the go let me tell you subtle is an understatement for this product when i opened the seal and held it under my nose i could hardly smell it when i applied it \( generously \) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable i rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it did n't help at all i expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice very disappointing	20

1	i 've never seen the original time machine versions before but i absolutely loved this movie i am of course a big fan of special effects but the story is fascinating ! i 've watched the movie several times and every single time i'm blown away the story line is inspirational and imaginative and knows no bounds you 'll continue to wonder where the story will end up if you love science fiction and have a fascination for time travel then add this movie to your collection !	20
1	another great powell loy collaboration this time with loy as an heiress who 's suing a newspaper for 5m after they ran a story about her being a husband stealer she 's not spencer tracy runs the paper and with nowhere else to turn he hires powell to romance loy and prove that she is a husband stealer problem is powell ai n't married so he quickly marries tracy 's girlfriend \( jean harlow \) the second problem is loy is extremely smart and cautious so powell has to get his foot in the door via her father who 's obsessed with trout fishing powell fakes being an expert trout fisherman with hilarious but successful results once he gets to loy he falls madly in love with her and on top of that harlow falls in love with powell ! great fun but unfortunately the picture on this dvd is n't the best and the lack of extras in insulting	20

0	more and more all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure and if you indulge in such a thing you are 'shallow' music has evolved past this attitude and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore and oh yeah their politics is so mixed up they do n't even know what they believe anymore i was a subscriber for eleven years my renewal notice came and i could n't come up with one good reason to send it in	20

1	the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival the author obviously knows his stuff what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published i'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j l bourne a deal he 's good	20

1	we are very happy with the gazebo and will be excited to use this next football season unfortunately the cover came with some stitching missing and we have not been able to receive any response from amazon after sending 4 emails we do not want to send the entire order back for another because the cost of shipping would be more than the cost to have someone repair the stitching we have only asked that our repair cost be covered by the company but we can not get anyone to respond we will never order anything through amazon again	20
1	i was fortunate to see this movie in a cinematic retrospective show i had already seen and liked ben hur `s 1959 version and was curious and keen to observe this earlier product i really was n't prepared to see such gem ! if for nothing else the sea battle scene alone merits viewing the movie in some ways the story line is better developed in this film than in the more modern one even if the acting as in all silent films applies some exuberance to the corporal demeanor there are also a couple of surprises some scenes are filmed in color enhancing the realism to the passion the chariots race is realistic in extreme and the already mentioned sea battle involves hundreds of extras director fred niblo reached his peak he was an experienced film maker having conducted major actors and actresses as rudolf valentino douglas fairbanks and lillian gish he was also author of first versions of films that will be remade in the future as the mark of the zorro \( 1920 \) the three musketeers \( 1921 \) and blood and sand \( 1922 \) ramon novarro also gives his best as judah ben hur before entering his path into oblivion francis bushman fleshes his messala with a mussolinian air and overacts a little very good film for all time cinema lovers ! reviewed by max yofre	20

1	i did a lot of research before buying this camera we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm dvd r finalize the disc on the camcorder and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd rom player on our computer we did n't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv electrical outlet and camera to playback footage and we also did n't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future for those of you who like to edit re record create effects etc you need to purchase special software separately but with a dvd ram disc you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd rom on your computer you can also download it with the usb cable but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started if you are only interested in playback dvd r discs are sufficient however you ca n't erase or record over footage on dvd rs only dvd rw and dvd ram discs the picture quality of the camera is adequate it is n't grainy but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting especially outside on a sunny day it does n't have a built in light so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording i would give the picture quality a 3 75 out of 5 if you want better quality you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy you ca n't compare it to tv and movie camera quality but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos the zoom is good but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly the stabilizer is pretty good but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality if you plan to move around a lot use the function but expect to lose a little quality in the process what basically happens when using the stabilizer \( with most cameras i believe \) is that the image movements are slightly delayed the sound quality is adequate but if you are recording when it is windy you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand the only problem i have had so far is with the discs we bought panasonic dvd rw discs and ca n't get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player we ended up purchasing sony dvd r discs and they play with no problem when i called panasonic about their dvd rw discs they did n't have a good answer the representative told me to make sure the dvd rw discs are compatible with my players i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player but it should be with my new computer software the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there is n't any difference between sony and panasonic discs \( interesting \) they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual but now i know better overall this camcorder is a great value \( you ca n't beat the price for this dvd technology \) average to good quality picture and functions is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage and is really easy to use	20
1	i like this for both the biking and running walking easy to set up the pedometer a little harder for the bike there 's a long cord the front also scratched when i removed the plastic covering making it harder to read on the right side it 's working great though and i'm happy with the product	20
1	this one is definately the best out of all of the previous acid music programs it has a ton of loops a really cool looking skin and much more options than in acid 1 0 or 2 0 it comes with two cds one of them has the application on it with some loops and the other cd has nothing but loops and demo songs ! it has over 1 600 unique loops ! definately a good buy for those who really liked any of the previous acid musics	20
0	this album had two good songs at the most ralph was good with new edition it 's apparently obvious that he ca n't stand alone bobby should have been the lead for new edition then we may never have seen this terrible album ralph is n't that good of a singer this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group does n't mean you are the best ralph is miles behind bobby	20

1	valkyrie profile was an rpg that came out during the later days of the psx while it never achieved massive success it went on to become an rpg classic and has garnered a very loyal following fast forward to 2006 and we see the re release of this awesome rpg for the psp however do n't make the mistake of writing this off as a plain old port valkyrie profile lenneth includes new high quality cg movies that help immerse you in the story the graphics consist of highly detailed sprites on pre rendered backgrounds when seen on the vivid psp screen it just makes the game look downright beautiful some of the combos are just awesome to look at the battle system is a mix of real time and turn based fighting that is surprisingly intuitive newcomers and old pro 's will have no problem getting used to it at first glance it might look simple but as you progress through the game you 'll find a depth to it that makes it quite fun the main story itself is very well developed even if this rpg does n't follow the traditional linear way of telling it one of the things i enjoyed most about this game is the character episodes you see when you collect a new soul to help in the battle to save valhalla if you enjoy rpgs or feel adventurous enough i highly recommend you buy this game it 's definitely a must have psp game	20
0	this toy was a huge disappointment for me my boys took one look at it and threw it i thought it was much bigger than what it is i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it was n't even a decent size my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just was n't what i envisioned it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children	20
1	i am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera probably below average i started trying to use 100 sony electronic products because my computer was a sony and sony sony linkages make for easy use given that here is what i think of the product 1 it is amazing how much camera you can get for the money compared to just 6 months ago or a year ago this is a lot of camera for the money it is very small fits easily in your pocket but takes great pictures also it is very easy to use and recharge 2 a visit to the sony website suggests that sony has new cameras coming out constantly new cameras that are very similar this makes it hard to compare cameras even within the sony brand and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it 3 a problem with this camera given it is so small do not shake your pictures will be blurry i am a typical guy with very little fine motor control my hands have trouble holding small objects holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture well the results are not pleasant 4 i tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras i guess if you really want to zoom in then you have to go to a big camera but it still seems like the small cameras could offer more 5 having said all of that in the end this camera is small and easy to carry light weight durable and it is also easy to use when you look at it it looks well made i ended up giving the camera to my in laws because they lost theirs my in laws tend to be technologically challenged i said to them just leave the dial set to the little green camera and snap away i have to say they love this camera overall for the money a great purchase technology is amazing just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than i have	20

1	most reviewers on this site are unenthusiastic about this particular product i think the main reason for that level of dissatisfaction is as someone else suggested that people need to pay attention to how exactly this trimmer works because of its design best results are obtained when it is inserted withdrawn then inserted again and the procedure repeated second tip rinse the rotating blade switched on under the hot tap to remove accumulated hair etc after each use it works better when clean the main plus of this product is its size yes it is flimsy made in china and would probably sell for 2 50 if it did n't say panasonic on it or come with a 12 month panasonic warranty but it works very well if you use it right and keep it clean i have had mine a couple of years and the only problem is that the blade is now dull and replacement blades are apparently not available	20

0	i was reading about my son it all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense really talked about a framework of letting the decision making \( and the consequence of their decision \) remain with the teen then half way the book screeched in a new direction all of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view when it comes to sex the authors do n't want you to leave the decision with the teens they want to take that one back which weakens the premise they present the authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position which i would have respected if not agreed with then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes christ into the conversation solution if i knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system i would n't have spent the 22 i would have wanted to know that in advance tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book buyer bewar	20

0	i 've read and enjoyed all the starfist novels this is one of them in name only it starts like a typical starfist novel and even ties in some references to charlie bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends i never did figure out what the author 's point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash the men of the fist are hard working hard fighting marines who trace an honorable history back to the us marines of the 19th 20th century these force recon marines are a ruthless bunch of screw ups who could trace their ancestry back to the waffen ss rather than root for them i soon found myself rooting for the opposition they invade a fellow member of the confederation screw up their primary assignment fail to get the info they were sent for kill allied soldiers and airmen murder helpless civilian prisoners and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state someone should remind the authors that recon is about getting accurate timely information it 's not about blowing things up i really wasted my money on this book i definitely wo n't be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle	20

1	on a gusty day when i saw the chessy plastic thermometer i gave my wife for mother 's day shattered on the back deck i decided it was about time to replace it with something decent i did my home work on the internet and found that la crosse made good quality unit at a reasonable price after opening the box when my ws 8025 arrived and reading over the instructions i had it up and running in under 20 minutes the ws 8025 allows you to adjust the barometer to local conditions \( which you can get on line from your local schools \) i 've had it up a running for two weeks and find that the ws8025 does a good job of forecasting the weather the atomic clock took a day to link up \( which they tell you in the manual it might \) but has stayed linked up since i purchased the optional tx3up with remote probe that i have in my fish pond so besides seeing the outside temerature and humidity i can keep an eye on the pond you can set the ws 8025 to alarm at any high and low temperatures that you chose \( which came in handy the other night when the pond heater failed \) so far i'm happy with my purchase and i like the way the lacrosse ws 8025oak looks on the wall	20

1	i love the city its particular rhythm and energy is like no other place in the world 'new york magazine' captures some of this and works to be fashionable and fast glossy and up to date stylish and hip \( if that is still the word \) i sort of like some of this but a lot of it seems to me trivial and idiotic and a lot of the trendy stuff is just way out of my league but 'new york' often has wonderful writing i cite here james atlas as a particularly good contributor and it tells you things about the city no other magazine does some of those things old conservative me will not read but at times there are pieces here that cannot only be 'fun' but give a real feeling why the big apple is still the 'empire state building \( or flatiron building \) of all the great cities	20

1	my initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge and full of ads i also read vogue though and to be honest w has less ads in it w convieniently avoids the snotty air of harper 's bazaar and vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in cosmopolitan redbook and marie claire and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of instyle this magazine has excellent layouts and from what i 've read thus far excellent and very different stories as a regular vogue reader i'm used to reading about older designers like coco chanel the versace and prada lines and reading about a small smattering of socialites like aerin lauder paris hilton jemma kidd victoria traina what is different about w is that it profiles the new and the modern an article in the september issue profiled kate spade and her new line other articles talked almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites meanwhile talking about in an article aptly titled a bag called it the trend of statement purses and their proper place w is also similar to vogue that in addition to the good layouts it has even better photography there are no photoshopped to death photos in here and if they are this student ca n't find them what i like most about w is its sarcastic wit something that is lost in most magazines many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man worship teri hatcher or read dumbed down articles	20

1	man these things are good i used to eat pop tarts all the time but it eventually got to the point that a \) i got tired of pop tarts and b \) they seemingly just stopped making them like they used to instead of being good and soft like they 're supposed to be pop tarts morphed into hard pastries that felt and tasted like they had been left out in the air for a couple of days these new go tarts at least the frosted strawberry ones are just right soft pastries with just the right amount of strawberry inside them to give you that elusive strawberry twang taste \( some of you may know what i'm talking about here \) these things are ready to eat right out of the pack so ready to eat in fact that there 's a message on each package stating that you should not put them in a toaster or microwave if you 're the daredevil sort and insist on breaking kellogg 's prescribed rules i ca n't stop you but do n't blame me if your microwave explodes or something of course one little 1 2 oz bar is n't enough for anyone bigger than a chihuahua puppy so volume is an important factor here which is where these multi pack boxes come in so handy with 140 calories per bar i do n't guess these things will be making any of jenny craig 's diet plans any time soon but i say life 's too short eat all you want and with these individually wrapped bars you wo n't face the classic pop tart dilemma of having to choose between eating two pastries now or putting one back in the box knowing that it will taste even more stale later because you 've already freed it from its freshness preserving little tinfoil wrapper thingy	20
1	i had the distinct pleasure of seeing richard jeni live a few years ago and i gotta tell you that i really almost peed my pants he was astoundingly funny this dvd definitely captures his comic genius although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed it was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which from what i heard was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get which is itself really sad he developed what i think is the best comedy which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are ultimately pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world he will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do and by doing so how we should and can be a lot better than we are	20

1	this bra is great for those of us with smaller busts it 's the only bra i 'll wear under my t shirts now because it does n't show the outline through the shirt like every other padded bra i 've found it very comfortable the only downside is that mine did lose it 's form \( it 's not as tight fitting as it used to be \) a little bit faster than some other bras but it 's absolutely worth buying a replacement i just hope they never stop making this bra	20
1	i travel quite a bit and am able to use the digital recorder to take notes while driving it has saved me a lot of time and works well	20
1	had these on my wish list and received them as a gift they are even more lovely in person they are one of my favorite pairs i wear them all the time they 're very simple yet elegant and very well made especially for the price i will definitely buy more from this company	20
1	reinventing the bazaar used real life examples to make markets understandable to any reader from pharmaceutical companies to the tokyo fish market mcmillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes he attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets and in my opinion he succeeds each chapter presents a new market setting which mcmillan uses to illustrate his various points while the book has an economic undertone the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student all terminology is explained not only with words but with examples as well the book was enjoyable especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings however i would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book	20
0	another lense jam problem the lense cover accidentally slide open in my pocket and the lense extended and jammed this happened frequently with my old powershot s30 but never caused a problem canon said the warranty is void because there 's a tiny dent on the front and back they said any physical damage voids the warranty i complained that the camera has an all metal body which dings easily they gave me 20 off the repair	20
1	this is a great sterilizer it 's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings i bought it when my son was born and after a year i'm still using it it works great saves time and has an auto shut off function when the steaming cycle is complete	20
0	i find it difficult to give a self help book much credibility when it is filled with spelling errors grammar errors and printing errors i would think that someone who cares enough to write a book to help people could at least care enough to check her work	20
1	i wanted an inexpensive watch which keeps accurate time this fills the bill quite nicely it sets itself daily and even uses wwv 's leap year flag so you do n't have to worry about the daylight savings time change it is a bit fussy here in pittsburgh \( hill country \) it took a bit of experimentation to find some place to sit it overnight where it will get a good signal it instructs in the manual to sit it near a window with the six on the watch pointed at the window and to let it sit for up to 10 minutes i followed the manual instructions several times then i picked up the watch right after i initiated the manual search for the signal i moved it around until it showed a steady 3 \( highest signal level \) problem solved adjusting the band should be as simple as looking for the arrows and pusing out the pin etc except it require brute force i broke a jeweler 's screwdriver and small punch in the process i should have bought an expansion band at the same time	20
1	i 've been using sweetleaf steviaplus for about 3 weeks now and i'm so glad i decided to try it i was worried about the research coming out about aspartame and splenda well it just does terrible things to my stomach i simply ca n't use it so i started doing some web searching and learned about stevia i liked the fact that it was natural and used extensively in other countries such as japan but i still kept my expectations low it sounded too good to be true and i figured it would taste awful i ordered sweetleaf steviaplus and to my surprise and delight i love the taste it 's sweet and no bitterness now i'm a person who is used to using artificial sweeteners so someone who uses only sugar might have a different opinion but i did share it with a coworker to use in his tea and he really liked it as well so do n't be afraid to try it if you have n't already i notice that i'm feeling a lot better lately maybe it 's the switch from artificial sweeteners to stevia at any rate i'm happy with it and i recently placed another order for both packets and tablets	20

1	we have tried 3 4 different gates at the top of our stairway over the past 3 years with our 2 young children \( now 4 yrs and a 10 month old \) this is a great option for a gate ours is solidly installed it clicks shut automatically with an audible click \( so after my 4 year old goes through i do n't have to worry about him leaving it open it closes by itself and i can hear the click that tells me it closed \) and you do n't have to drill holes in your woodwork staircase to install this it is much easier to open just as sturdy as the drill in gates and looks nicer than all of the other gates we tried we love it for our house	20
0	crap does n't work wanted to return it but had to go out of town and lost the time period plastic junk never did get a good signal the worst sony item i 've ever purchased and i'm a sony fan will still attempt to return somehow do n't even bother	20
1	this is an excellent product in that it protects my treo 650 without hiding its style i chose treo because of its unique look and excellent features however the case from palm did n't work for me because i use the phone a lot and i dont have time to put the phone back in the case everytime so it gets thrown in my purse along with other items which then scratch it i also bought a body glove case and while i can use the phone while in it it hides the treo 's real look plus typing on the keyboard with a covered plastic is a drag this one seems to even enhance the treo 's style	20
1	it was 13 years ago when i frist saw this movie and i simply loved it to death then as said in the song quot little jackie paper found time for other things and came no more quot it was then last week when i herd the song on a local radio station and it all came back to me i had to see this movie again memroys came running back from my childhood came running back this is a great movie for all	20

0	the ski rack is attached to the thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar the old 724 had metal connectors making them plastic is insane these connectors will break over time additionally a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors	20

0	i love the nancy drew games and i own every one i bought this game with high hopes then i finished it in only one day it was that simple yes like all nancy drew games there were interesting characters amazing graphics and intriguing puzzles but those good things failed to even out the bad the game was over much too quickly the problem of the game was too simple and seemingly unimportant there was not much to do and the three or so mandatory tasks were monotonous and dull while the character switch her interactive offered was interesting it could also be very confusing the characters though interesting were not as thoroughly developed as in the other nancy drew games and what i consider the worst fault of all the ending of the game was absolutely horrid it was by far the worst of all the games in its series there was no action or chase or anything that really needed a brain or quick thinking it was just over while the nancy drew games are an amazing series as a whole this game just left me wondering what was her interactive thinking \? i would recommend this game only to the die hard nancy drew fans to those of you merely seeking a fun and entertaining game look at some of the other nancy drew games i believe that the curse of blackmoor manor the secret of shadow ranch and the secret of the scarlet hand are the best	20
1	the great power of this movie is that you have no time to breath between the action scenes the plot is easy to follow and all is the action and i think jj abrams did a great job as director this dvd is worth looking	20
0	i bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none in the photo the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area however this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper there 's no structure under it at all the quality of the slipper 's upper is lower than expected it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of wool blend also one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after i put my foot in the slipper the first time the rubber sole is substantial though heavier than i like to wear in a slipper all in all i regret spending the money on these	20
1	i too have placed an order \( actually 3 \) with ana super on jan 3 and did not receive my shipment if you go to their web site http www anasuper com you will see that they are on vacation the first week of january and will resume shipments on january 10 initially i was upset too that i had not received my order after paying overnight shipping fees however given that they are on vacation i will also update my review and provide information regarding my experience with them re packaging shipping etc i received an e mail from anasuper and indeed they were on vacation last week they said that they would send out my orders of wagashi today and they should be received tomorrow hurray ! the wagashi did arrive i had minor problems with 2 more orders coming through but the customer service did a thorough job tracking down what happened and now all orders have been completed the wagashi were very fresh and tasted great i sent some to my sister and to my student 's mother as well my brother in law has eaten almost half the order already ! i would do business with ana super again	20

1	i really like this conditioner from lush i wash my hair everyday and because of this \( and long soaks in the bath \) my hair gets pretty dry this conditioner is absorbed really quickly and does n't have an overpowering scent i am not a huge fan of coconut but this and the shampoo makes my hair smell like a tropical cocktail which i think is really nice i would n't use it every day and do n't recommend it unless you have dry hair that needs a bit of extra care i have used american cream but i think coolaulin is better at least for my hair i have thick straight mid length hair great conditioner to make hair soft but strong and also shiny	20
1	when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully samuel johnsonmichael keaton gives an effective and heart felt performance as bob jones a young successful pr executive married to a beautiful woman \( nicole kidman \) who is expecting their first child the bottom falls out of his life when he is diagnosed with a fatal illness and only given months to live he is forced to exam his life that he 's really just been rushing through bob jones not only has never stopped to smell the roses he has n't even noticed that they are there at all 'my life' is a realistic portrayl of what must go through one 's mind when one is brought up short by such stunning news although the topic is certainly depressing it is something we will all one day face this is how one man deals with the terribly bad hand he has been delt especially poignant is the fact that not only wo n't he probably be around to help raise his child but he might not even make it long enough to see his child born heart wrenching in several pivotal scenes jones decides to hope for a miracle and visits an asian healer \( haing ngor who starred in 'the killing fields' \) who tells him that he has too much anger and hurt in him jones resists the whole notion of exploring how he got to where he is at least for a while his anger at his family is one point of anger he must struggle with keaton does an excellent job here we see flashes of the actor we saw in 'mr mom' and earlier movies sort of a lovable good hearted guy with a funny edge to him his bob jones evolves slowly and realistically from a man who is stunned and angry to a man determined to let his child know who he is ngor also plays the right note as a practioner who ca n't cure his patient but perhaps can help him in his last journey a potentially maudlin down beat subject is handled with just the right amount of empathy and gentleness and with a light touch highly recommended very highly recommended if you 've had such a scare are living with a terminal illness or have had a loved one deal with such issues	20
1	these are very well crafted little earrings i love how they look and the price just ca n't be beat ! these have made me want to buy many more things from silver insanity ! the only problem i did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long and it pokes the side of my head when i sleep otherwise i could n't love them more !	20

1	i'm using it for a few months now i have n't found a single problem so far earlier i was using an old finepix and the optic sensor sensitivity was not very good poor quality of photos taken in dark environment this is not a problem any more also i was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom in general i was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out \) sure there are better cameras on the market however considering the price it is just a great deal	20

1	i bought this mat because my gym recently began offering yoga classes and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody this mat is longer and thicker than the gym 's version looks a lot nicer and has a good 'tacky' feel under my bare feet and it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores it 's easy to hand wash \( and comes with instructions \) so i can keep it clean overall it 's a great yoga mat	20
0	this printer sucks ! it started out working wonderfully then all of a sudden \( after the third month in use \) it started printing very slowly then it decided it would n't print at all unless i completely shut down my computer everytime something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge it also uses the color ink when it 's not requested i only needed the color ink a couple of times \( not for pictures \) and it went just as fast as the black i used to love hp they are now making garbage i'm thinking of looking at the oki brand do n't waste your money on this one	20
1	i purchased this usb light fan combo mainly for the fan i'm one of those guys who is a human heater always a little warmer than everyone else i use this fan when i'm studying in the library on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk it provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over i can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running of course you can see right through the blades the fan runs quietly too i 've had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or is n't running a quickly as normal i just pop off the rotor head adjust the blades a bit \( they are flexible vinyl and i give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case \) pop the rotor head back on and it 's good as new again while i like this product a lot i doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but i still think it 's well worth it my only regret is that i did n't order two or three of these for future back ups if needed the light works well too it does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user \( a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but i think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well \) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document	20
1	the item was exactly as expected the packaging for shipment along with the other item i ordered was unacceptable a child could have done better	20
0	one might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming flip mopping is progressive in some way but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup i 'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum and then follow with a functional well designed good mop \( like the old steammop they discontinued \) these things function better as seperate units which is why there 's no washing machine that 's also a dryer the flip it is a very loud machine so loud that i did n't hear my phone ring in the same room this makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children too it 's difficult to push and feels like it 's gripping to the floor it does n't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs cabinets with it 's big fat part vacuum head and when you 're finished it 's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter \( which you 're supposed to keep dry somehow \) so you can look forward to a second job once you 've finished the job of cleaning your floors and because of the flip it back and forth design the thing has no equilibrium it fell to the floor at least 3 times even when i was so careful to rest it against something once when this happened the dirty water recovery tank hit the floor fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just cleaned floor a true nightmare i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters pads for my bissell steammop and i thought i had better give the latest and greatest a try but sadly i was disappointed i do n't review things often but i felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean this contraption is not your answer on a side note i wrote to bissell to bring back the steammop \( what an excellent product \) so i'm hoping that they will one day	20

1	this is the 6th and last entry in the series lone wolf cub this one not only has a different director than kenji who directed 4 of the others this is the entry most like a comic book \( the series is based on a famous comic book series \) not that that is bad the whole series fluctuated between great period detail serious themes and not taking itself too seriously it was at once graphic and fantastic realistic and wildly improbable factual and imaginary serious silly that 's what made it so damn interesting throughout the series the action has taken place in different locales and landscapes of japan tracing actual historical roads and cities now we end the series in the mountains and the snow the white heaven in hell of the title this entry has a lot of stuff going on lord retsudo of the hated yagyu clan ogami 's arch enemy sends his last child a daughter to do in ogami with her falling dagger technique when predictably she fails he goes to an illegitimate son that was abandoned and raised by a mountain tribe the downhill ski battle may not be quite as intense and exciting as the one in her majesties secret service but it ai n't bad that ogami 's baby cart guns never seem to need reloading etc are minor quibbles if ogami does n't shoot em he always seems able to bifurcate them behead them or run em through red sprays all over the white snow anyway they wind the series up with a bang one of the strangest most unique and unusual series ever produced anywhere worth it if you do n't mind the violence	20
1	car and driver is the multi purpose auto magazine it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world and magazines like motor trend which focus on the more practical the magazine is always a fun intereseting read and keeps you up to date on teh auto world i must however say that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track \( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography \)	20
0	we just bought this camera to replace our minidv jvc dvl500 that was bought in 2000 in short the picture taking ability is worthless and the quality is very grainy and dark i applied the workaround listed above but found that i had to set the frame rate to 1 15 in order to ge the brightness that i needed which caused a very jittery image the quality of this camera is something that i would expect for 200 needless to say i am returning this camera today	20

1	this is fantastic ! great music great story awesome photography ! i promise you will love this film	20
0	god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic and yes maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book 's great reputation i entered it with high expectations which the book however did not satisfy yes it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time a lampoon of the courtship ritual and of course oh so witty blah blah blah but it just was n't my cup of tea the main character was likeable but that aside i found it completely insufferable to read through and absolutely painfully boring every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted let alone the ending not that anything really ever happens the entire book could be summed up with then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea walked and talked and had more tea then got married and lived happily ever after the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama it would save more time just to watch a chick flick so if you 're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters witnessing the agony over who 's going to marry who \( even though the reader could already predict the happily ever after match making light years in advance \) then this is the book for you ! ! if not then i suggest picking up some dan brown	20
1	i got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded sweet low packages i love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances the item itself works pretty good for the most part the only issue i have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it to remedy the issue i am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place i'm not sure if a review is the appropriate forum to mention that actually finding this item or one like it on the web was very difficult to locate perhaps additional keywords can be added to the item to make it easier to find i used search terms like mini trash can counter top trash can small waste basket small stainless steel trash can but none of these got me to this item i'm not sure how my husband finally found it	20
1	bought these for my dad for christmas he saw the box they came in and thought it was a poker set lol he 's always wanted a grill set i love the fact that they are all one piece of stainless nothing to break the only reason i give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the box seems kinda cheap and was a little damaged not to the point were i would need to get rid of it just poor workmanship	20

1	i was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program setting up the query parameters is easy the amount of info concerning places of interest \( services banks transportation \) is substantial about the only drawback i found was the quality of the help contents which was not very user friendly most of the time i was unable to find solutions to my question problem because the data was way too complicated \( displaying data in technical equations \) or was not listed at all however calls to technical support usually resolved the questions finally i was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map \( ie a listing of addresses for your push pin locations \) other than that the program is very handy loaded with tons of great data the quality of the maps is superior	20
1	if your little guy or gal is struggling with telling time and is a lego fan this is the best deal money can buy under 20 and is expandable etc probably not the most durable diver type watch you 'll ever buy but it is really good looking easy to assemble \( it 's a lego \) and all the kids think it 's neat to boot	20

0	i bought these shoes to do aerobics in they look good and are comfortable but only to walk in there is zero arch support and when i walk in them i feel as if my feet are flat on the ground there is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics my old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones but i ca n't use the old ones the gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes they are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt i am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location now i have to look again	20

0	this film is a documentary not a movie for those of you who admire european films with honest casual nudity this film may not be for you european films with honest casual nudity usually are non pornographic in content this film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level if you want to view this film fine but be prepared for some tears and nausea this film is not for the faint hearted though here in america we do need to let loose our prudishness when it comes to casual nudity yet to europeans who tolerate young children being victims of sexual exploitation i ask where are your child protection agents your social workers your law enforcement agents your religious leaders and for crying out loud the parents \? i admire europe 's easy going ways when it comes to casual nudity whether on the screen or on their beaches but when you view this film you might think that a lot has to be said for the way we protect our children in america against sexual exploitation i cannot think of a more vicious sinister crime i believe the body has a soul only these young lads were cheated out of a healthy outlook on the body let alone a normal healthy childhood my poor heart just cries out to them i practically saw the devil through that pornographer in question i was going to rent angels but not angels but this film and mandragora were enough for me	20
1	i love this bag ! i purchased the pink chocolate color and i get alot of compliments on how cute it is i am in my early 20 's and i have a 2 and half year old and this bag can hold what i need for him as well as my things and still not look bulky or overstuffed and at the same time is very stylish i really like those trendy baby bags for those young moms but they are very expensive this is lightweight made of cotton so very easy to clean i chose standard shipping and it came so quickly i am very satisfied with my purchase	20

1	overall this is an extremely awesome concert i am a big fan of dt and like pretty much all their stuff the performance itself is pretty good although the only truly special thing they do is the instrumedley and jordan 's keyboard solo other than that they pretty much just play their songs as you hear them on the album if they had done more special things it would have gotten a 5 star rating instead of 4 other people complain about how the band really doesnt get into their music during the performance but would say they did okay as far as that goes sure the singer doesnt get out from behind the mic stand thats because half the time he is dragging it along with him although i will say the band overall doesnt really get into it as much as most other metal bands and thats probably why they have the video show up on the screens behind them the special features are also pretty good but i would not buy this concert just for those backstage footage and things of that nature are cool but do not make a dvd good by themselves overall i did think it was pretty cool and i would recommend buying it if you like dream theater or just their genre of music in general	20

0	for those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a s m relationship i would highly suggest the japanese film moonlight whispers over maitresse that film is a gentle coming of age film with male sub fem dom theme while maitresse is a somewhat confused film about an ex con who stumbles into a dungeon and a \( highly unlikely \) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix the ex con cannot deal with her career eventually and threatens her to quit etc \( at some point you get the idea that the director himself really does n't understand where the domina is coming from \) what started out as an interesting film with a provacative opening soon falls apart about halfway through the writer director seems to lose the narrative thread of the film and things degenerate with the ex con wanting to buy the dominitrix out from her protection \( or pimp for want of a better word \) then we watch as the ex con in a totally unrelated and gratuitous foray goes to a slaughterhouse where a real horse is shown killed onscreen strung up and stabbed and drained of blood as it kicks helplessly \( this image will upset you for weeks believe me ! i feel like it 's my duty to warn you ! \) and the film gets even worse from there and finally ends up with a ridiculous car accident and the two main characters laughing like idiots totally stupid \( like the writer director suddenly ran out of ideas \) believe me i really wanted to like this movie i ignored the negative reviews because there are so few real films on this subject but i was sorely disappointed and depressed by it if you need to see this film rent it it 's definitely a one view film at best and it will be a film that will leave you angry \( because the horse scene \) and vaguely disgusted and generally bummed out too bad moonlight whispers is a much better respectful treatment of s m a film with real characters and nuance one that seeks to explore real psychological \( and sexual orientation \) questions while also being a beautiful film to watch that film deserves to be seen and a wider audience !	20

1	the scooter is fine the post office lost the package though i called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days weeks and would not send a replacement unless i was willing to pay for it in advance i opted to purchase another one through a different company that used ups instead of usps \( more reliable shipping \) several days later the first scooter arrived three weeks late the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it so now i have two and only needed one i realize usps is at fault for the shipping but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker the scooter was a present for a birthday i ordered in plenty of time to receive prior but ended up with a very late present	20

1	spoiler alertthe ending of this 118 minute marvel seems an almost foregone conclusion the bored billionaire did it however he and the sexy insurance detective play with each other until the audience is very very hot pierce brosnan the billionaire still sexist from his stint as james bond enjoys playing with the lady renee russo and she as the tough but sexy catherine olds banning loses her heart to him as much heart as such a sexpot character is allowed in the process she shows some very appealing nipples the 1968 version of which this is a remake starred steve mcqueen and faye dunaway in this version to the socially irresponsible self absorbed 90s are ever present we do n't mind not having the suspense we just yearn to see brosnan and russo get it on dunaway appears as a psychiatrist who is trying to help the billionaire figure out why he is so socially irresponsible brosnan as thomas crown is bored but open to being titillated by a beautiful woman for as long as he is interested in her for thrills he steals priceless works of art from publicly funded museums the film makes it clear he can do so under the noses of security guards police and hundreds of innocent art lovers russo 's insurance company insured the painting so she is looking to recover the irreplaceable but impossible to fence monet and save her employer a bundle what we have here is a film with clever dialog rich and exotic sets and loads of sexual tension one wonders now after enron worldcom tyco and other corporate heists just whom brosnan is cheating in order to support his high tech heist brigade how many of his employees are going to lose their pensions or health care benefits over this he never really you know works but i digress dennis leary has a character role as the streetwise new york detective who advises russo 's banning as we watch her slowly spiral out of control risking her job and her reputation we are kept mildly engaged in the question of whether russo will fall for him or brosnan duh the film moves back and forth from caper to cover up this can be confusing but who cares \? all we have to do is wait for their next move the next gorgeous set the next revealing love scene the thomas crown affair will keep both men and women interested for all the usual reasons it is a film worth watching and a great date flick	20
1	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	20
1	i make thai curries occasionally and the mortar and pestle i was using was tiny i would have to grind up all the spices in batches to avoid them from spilling out i finally broke down and looked for a larger set and found this one i debated between the 2 and 3 cup version because i did n't have a good feel for how big they really were i ended up getting the 2 cup version and i love it it is very large plenty big enough for making a good size curry paste its also very heavy because as advertised is made of a solid chunk of granite it also looks great attractive enough to leave out on the counter and people constantly comment on it when visiting mine does n't look quite like the picture on amazon the outside of the bowl \( mortar \) and the top half of the pestle appear to be polished in the picture which is not the case for the one i received very heavy and solid a great purchase	20

0	it 's a bad idea to create a character driven sci fi when your characters are this annoying the majority of children of the mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about the characters are so one dimensional and predictable that you already know what they 'll say before they say it peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person novinha is as crazy and hard headed as she 's been for the last two books and ender spouts off a bunch of trite up with people garbage every chance he gets somehow card even managed to make jane more irritating than my ex girlfriend during pms the only decent characters in this book are miro and wang mu and they are n't nearly enough to save the story i admit it i only made it a little over half way through children of the mind i could n't take the dialogue anymore that 's not to mention the ridiculous plot which centers on two children warping around the universe engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of japanese and polynesian culture in an attempt to avert a war between species if you 're that curious to learn how the ender quartet concludes do what i should 've done from the beginning find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage	20

0	in theory this camera is perfect fits into your pocket video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of mpeg 4 pictures are good if you know how to finesse it perfect all around anytime camrea right \? here 's the thing i got the camera mainly for video i just had a daughter and wanted something for those candid moments that i could always have on me also i did not want minidv because uploading to the computer is real time i wanted the sd card as film even if it would sacrfice some video quality but the thing that ruins this camera for me is the mic picks up the lens motor auotfocus nosie on the playback i cearly hear the zooming in and zooming out and every time the lens focuses it sounds like someone smoking a hooka and get this it even says so in the instruction manual page 35 caution during video clip playback the sound of a motor is audible during recording the sound of the optical zoom movement or autofocus movement was recorded this is not a malfunction awful by the way the take a picture while recording video function is worthless it leaves a pause on your video image while the sound keeps recording and the still image captured is usually blury whats the point anyway i think the camera has a built in function to extract a still from the video or you can do it with whatever editing software you use oh and one last thing i have to keep the still camera in sports mode to get a clean pic my hand shakes too much there is a digital stabalization for the video but no optical stabilization for the stills its a big shame too the camera is very cool if not for the audible motor noise i would have given this at least an 8 10 but the lens motor noise is unacceptable ! ps all cameras today should have a built in lens cover this is one has a cheap plastic one that you 'll probably lose	20
0	i am really thinking of returning it to amazon i think i will stick with good 'ol ms word you see i wanted a 12 page form and spent two days creating it it 's a form to survey boats so it also had graphic areas for photos \( about 12 \) well all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to pdf the size of the created pdf was near 10mb ! \( similary done with ms word resulted in a 1 2mb finished pdf \) well i ca n't be e mailing 10mb files ! i also recieved the book for the 5 0 filler which says it can use dragon naturally speaking \( i use that \) i 'll be darned if i can figure out where that tool is you must activate voice recognition in the tool bar and if you use dragon naturally speaking in the form filler area all sentences start out without capital letters say and select does not work \( i should note that dragon naturally speaking works flawlessly in ms word ! \) so you manually have to go back and capitalize each sentence finally as others have said there is no faq and generally no troubleshooting help on the scansoft web site this is very poor for a near 100 product there would be no way that i would spend 700 on their premium edition	20

0	after 5 boys my first daughter just had to have a pink highchair for her princess 1st birthday party so i retired the boys trusty blue graco \( still in great shape after 4 years \) into the basment and ordered this pink one after what we paid for it i do n't know how to tell my husband i want the blue one back ! \( maybe i can fnd a pink cover \? ! \) my daughter is 12 months old 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap there is a 3inch gap between her the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap the thick padded seat is adorable comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up the base is very large her food falls down onto it after every meal so i am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well the buckles are awkward impossible to do with one hand if you have a petite baby this is not the highchair for you	20
0	it is obvious that this movie is full of lies although i have not actually seen it i know this to be true because i have seen many discussions on the movie on the fox news channel \( god bless them ! \) the way he attacks poor mr heston is deplorable ca n't michael moore tell from the comments charlton made at the rallies that he does n't have his faculties about him \? i am also unsure that mr heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying the ability of hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing making it appear that my president \( heston \) is an uncaring babbling idiot by simply using his own words shame on you michael ! and as for the way he got the gun from the bank i agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they did n't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank bravo to those who figured that out also michael moore is fat take that pinkie	20

1	most old skool fans are angry he 's not a vw beetle anymore i kinda never liked beetles anyway so im happy with the new unlicenced thing it looks like a mix of a mini and a peugeot he transforms better than most the picture does'nt do him justice it makes him look stiff actually for how bulky he is he 's amazingly bendable i particularly like that his door shields are'nt attached to his arm their on a cuffling that rotates so they wont be too awkward like many of the others with door shields the jetski jetpack adds an unneeded extra flair to an already awesome robo mode and as an extra retro touch it has a tempurture sensitive decal on his chest top of the car that must be held for a minute before it will reveal the autobot logo just like his original 80s version i do wish he had come with some sort of weapon but i have a few other transformers from this same generation that do n't really need both that they came with what 's even more awesome for me is that i bought this at the grocery store as one of the very few toys they had in thier christmas section for 10 if your looking for just any one good transformer bumblebee is a good choice if you have optimus this one looks great standing beside him transformer fans do n't delay pick this one up ! i ca n't wait to see movie 's camaro bumblebee in july	20

0	this is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860 's narrated by a civil war deserter within the first few pages our hero enlists pilfers letters off battlefield corpses deserts is injured in nyc draft riots ends up in new bedford ma and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going the book was downhill from there page after page described ice and the crew 's interminable struggles to get through getting through the book was nearly as interminable the reader never gets to know the narrator enough to empathize with him or really understand him at all thus his struggles ring hollow and he evokes no sympathy during his struggles there are elements of fantasy in the book not enough to make it a fantasy but enough to steer a reader off course the scientist on the mission is after a warm garden of eden in the middle of the arctic he is mad or it 's fantasy it is hard to know until the end there is a fantasy interlude when a character who has three hands \( the most likeable character in the book \) describes how he got his third hand from that yarn comes the title rope eater the title really has nothing to do with the book other than rope eaters and the crew members suffered pain besides the tedious turning of the plot the characters lack any development only the three handed man and the captain both tangential characters had any depth whatsoever this book seemed to be an attempt at adventure but not enough happened between the interminable accounts of ice to build much tension it never developed the aspect of the deterioration of the characters mentally and physically it just happened although the reader knew the characters must be suffering it never came through the over writing as one might expect the crew 's mission to find the warm garden of eden in the arctic was pointless so was this book it was a disappointment	20

1	i internet shopped for a week reading consumer reports and customer reviews of just about every blender made i decided on this one based on my research and i am glad i did i make my husband fruit and juice smoothies almost every day after work and with this machine it is a fast easy job ice and frozen fruit are blended into the drink very quickly it is a little loud but it is worth the noise to have 500 watts of power i also like the fact the base is heavy cast metal the pitcher is thick solid glass with a tight fitting lid and the blade is stainless i like the easy to use control knob and the fact it has 2 yes just 2 speeds i find most machines with 12 to 20 little buttons are fairly useless and all those speeds rarely used they also take up more counter space because the bases have to be bigger for all the buttons the fact that the hamilton beach comes in 6 colors is just icing on the cake and the moroccan red is gorgeous	20

1	this is a great magazine for people who like to drive for the fun of it rather than try to cover the entire automotive industry like some of the other magazines sports car international focuses on cars that are fun to drive the articles are interesting and well written the authors are n't afraid to point out a car 's flaws and the reviews and impressions seem quite balanced most importantly this magazine is written from the perspective of the driving enthusiast the authors focus on the things that make a car fun to drive not stuff like cupholders if you 're into fun cars both new and old this really is a must have magazine	20
1	what do you do when the world is coming to an end right before your very eyes but no one seems to believe you \? that is the concept facing dr thomas more distant relation to the famous infamous saint thomas more in walker percy 's novel love in the ruins the united states is at a time of crisis but few seem to understand the implications of the events unfolding around them it is up to dr more who knows how to diagnose the problem but not necessarily treat it to try to prevent the chaos from happening the story begins on a hot fourth of july with doc staking out the abandoned howard johnsons motel in town in three separate rooms he has cocooned his three paramours and he is waiting for an event that he knows is going to happen an event that could very possibly bring about the end of the world the novel then shifts back in time to the three previous days tracing doc 's journey that led him to seek refuge at the motel the reader learns that he has created a ontological lapsometer a sort of stethoscope of the human spirit through which he can diagnose exactly what ails a person 's soul and finally discovers how to treat it meanwhile there is a revolution brewing the bantus and love children are ready to take over what the white man has destroyed if a major catastrophe does n't befall everyone before that can happen love in the ruins is a truly southern novel crafted through percy 's intelligence and tempered with the same absurdity that is a trademark of great southern writers such as percy and flannery o'connor the reader must suspend disbelief as to the events unfolding even though they are frighteningly realistic and not so far fetched in this present day percy 's hero doc more is an antihero on par with those of hemingway flawed prone to drink forever chasing after women who are wrong for him this novel is his coming of age in a sense because doc learns what it is he wants out of life and how to best achieve that subtitled the adventures of a bad catholic at a time near the end of the world love in the ruins is a deliciously funny and poignant look at a near apocalyptic america	20
0	clinique 's exfoliating scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin it is a thick white paste packed with medium size scrubbing grains more grains than in clinique 's 7 day scrub for normal skin to use massage onto clean wet skin in a circular motion rinse with warm water careful not to get it in your eyes as i did once while rinsing it off in the shower this scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin but it 's unsuitable for sensitive skin and it stinks to high heaven it contains menthol which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing of course it is 100 fragrance free according to clinique meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes the scrub also contains salicylic acid so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types especially if used frequently the performance is n't bad the olfactory aesthetics are atrocious this is the harshest most caustic facial scrub i 've ever used sensitive complexions beware	20
0	i really do n't know how to write a helpful review for this camera i'm not a photographer all i can say is that i was not satisfied with my purchase so if you 're having trouble deciding which digital camera to get \( like i was a few months ago \) save your time and effort and start looking at other cameras here are my complaints flash is too strong \( blinding in fact \) please do not take this complaint lightly the flash is brighter than you think \( it actually hurts i'm talking physical pain here \) i actually fear it might have some long term effects this alone is a deal breaker for me ! it 's beyond me how this got past the testing stages at nikon sure you can turn the flash off but that only brings me to my other major complaint ! the lighting must be almost perfect if you want to take a semi decent picture without the flash the lens do not respond well to artificial lighting at all pictures either come out all grainy \( if it 's slightly dark \) or with huge white patches all over if there 's a lot of light in the background even when the lighting is almost perfect you lose a lot of quality \( even when using the highest settings 6mp \) the scene modes did n't help much i tried everything all the different modes offer so little difference very gimicky in my opinion even if you want to endure the pain and suffering of the mighty flash there 's a chance the pictures will come out somewhat unclear why \? i have no clue what so ever i might take the same exact picture at the same exact conditions and settings a minute apart and a slightly different pose \( but still stable \) and one would be blurry while the other is crystal clear ! must admit though the swivel design is very practical and makes things so much easier the video mode is great as well if you do n't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself and others via the blinding flash then i must admit the pictures do come out nicely \( most of the time	20
1	this game is really good ! i have a real up to date computer so everything runs fast and smooth the multiplayer is great ! you can play 1 000 's of people in a huge number of maps and game styles you can even type a message to your team or for everyone to hear ! one of the down points is that in multilayer someone may have modded a map to mess up the game or give them unlimited ammo and you get nothing another thing would be the lag this is where the game moves real choppy or you lose the network connection still its a really fun game	20

1	i have been scrapbooking for more than five years and i my style is rather simple however i recently found myself in a rut and i began wishing i could do the fancier pages so i began receiving creating keepsakes although i still have no desire to do a two page spread that takes 5 hours this magazine has been great at inspiring me to try new things as well as just giving me ideas for both scrapbooking and stamping in just the first three issues of my subscription they do a fairly good job of showing the expensive way to do a page as well as the more economical additionally there are product reviews and recommendations i typically buy most of my supplies from at home parties i found a very helpful recommendation for a silent eyelet setter some of their articles are geared towards the more advanced ambitious scrapbooker for instance a recent article explained how to use certain computer programs to augment photos the results were beautiful but this was just not up my alley they also recently did a spread on the scrapooking rooms of some of their staff and i was very very jealous ! i may never have any award winning spreads and i probably will never use my computer to augment my pictures but i know my scrapbooking will be more creative and better looking due to this magazine	20
1	this video gives insight into the life and persona of picasso while it touches on his climb to fame recognition and success in the art world it focuses primarily on his personal relationships i love his work but i sure would n't have wanted to live with him ! the video had therapuetic effects for me i would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly calls into question your own view of relationships how they are and how they should and should n't be a winner all the way around	20

1	the case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses it makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera you can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack my digital rebel xt fits with the canon battery grip and my macro lens attached however it would not fit with my 200mm lens attached my canon speedlight flash did not fit well in the lense section but fits perfectly in the separate section at the top portion of the bag the lenses all fit nicely allowing for several lenses depending on the size of them i bought a regular lowepro camera bag but found that it was awkward to place the camera in with lens attached this bag is designed to have the camera with a lens if you search google images for the lowepro slingshot 200 you will see what i mean about the side unzipping to allow the camera removal	20

0	i just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what i expected the description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable but i do n't quite get how to adjust this it also says that there is a blanket maybe i misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here i imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does at the thickest layer the wedge is maybe 2 1 2 inches thick i'm pretty disappointed i thought this was going to be the answer to my baby 's sleep problems	20

1	this is a very thorough very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states and while it may not be as easily readable as say david mccullough 's quot truman quot it is certainly less dry and slow going than most scholarly works if you 're looking for a full life biography of monroe one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure 's life this is an excellent choice if you 're looking for light reading with a historical basis this is definitely not what you 're looking for	20

1	after researching several cameras in this price range i bought the rebel t2 last month it has met my expectations and perhaps then some after recently trying out a friends camera in the 150 ish range i partially regret spending what i did it all comes down to what you need want and how many bells and whistles you like for the money though compared to the competitors i still think i made a good purchase after all if i use it for ten years which i most likely will i will have surely got my moneys worth bottom line no complaints with it	20
0	i thought this was great at first until i realized that it works sporadically i can get up in the morning and walk all over the house look down and check my sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps other times i can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps one of the problems with it is its shape unlike some pedometers \( like omron \) that are a vertical oval shape the sportline is a horizontal rectangle which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt it 's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately after much frustration i finally bought an omron pedometer which i love unfortunately this sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless	20
0	this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv \( which cannot turn the tv on and off \)	20
0	the only reason i picked up this album was the name norah jones i was expecting to hear her at the forefront and i did n't really to be honest i was hoping to hear more of what she sounded like in come away with me and feels like home if you 're looking for norah jones this is n't really the album you 're looking for	20
1	purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one i put the new drive in a usb external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software in about 20 minutes and 3 mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly i have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup the menus are easy to use making all available tasks straight forward	20
0	purchased this software because i got a deal with a special price break i have a very small business so a purchase of several hundred dollars needs to pay back quickly the set up took a lot longer than i had anticipated the customer service was no help could n't answer my questions i ended up spending 6 hours to get everything right another day wasted i 've got myself stuck with this now and will use for a few months since i 've spent the money but i'm going to look for alternatives in the meantime if this is quick books i need to find lightning fast books somewhere	20
0	whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its poor design the attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective the plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove the problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove the pocket stretches ! as soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt \( like when you sit down or bump anything \) the connector easily \( and silently \) dislodges from its elastic pocket ! ! ! your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it ! you have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip this is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of use this glove at your own peril	20
0	this book was so simplistic i was quite disappointed you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all a worthy goal but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit he really held back from delving into any dark territory his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit he always managed to put a happy positive spin on everything which is nice but life is n't that simple	20
1	the product is probably a decent product but it does n't work in my vehicle '04 jetta i think it has to do with the part you plug into the cigarrette lighter being to long	20
1	i can not find anything negative to say about this camera i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio 's exislim even though this camera is not as small as the casio it is far superior of a camera size why 's it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it is n't awkward or difficult to use the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera the lcd screen is also very clear unlike the casio and other camera 's similar to this one you ca n't go wrong with this camera highly recommended	20
1	i got this for my baby girl and both she and i love it ! ! ! she does n't slip and it is really comfortable for her she really enjoys bathtime and if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby you will really enjoy it i wanted this prior to my baby being born but i read some of the reviews and i did n't buy it for her after the first month of her using another tub and having trouble with the product i decided to buy this aquarium tub that i wanted in the first place caution please use the hammock as directed for your baby 's size this tub is perfect if you do that ! the reviews that i read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when i actually read the directions before use please read the directions both you and your child will appreciate that you did	20
1	these are a definite time saver with a couple of faults which another reviewer pointed out no flavorings in the rice nori cut too small to get around the rice problem just add a little rice vinegar and sugar to the rice and it comes out quite good i do n't particularly like wasabi but they should probably add a packet to the box for those who do the nori sheets taste good and fresh if maybe slightly salty for my tastes as stated before though they are definitely cut way too small you cannot achieve any kind of decent looking roll with them but if you are n't picky about what the finished product looks like and if you pack any added ingredients pretty thin you can get it to hold together long enough to eat it bottom line is for the ten bucks i paid for 6 packages i 'd say it is a definite winner for 6 cheap fast lunches that taste much better than they look i ca n't eat one sushi roll at a local sushi bar for less than 8 to 10 bucks now that the price for these has gone up a little i 'd probably consider just buying the larger size annie chun precooked sticky rice containers \( if amazon gets them back in stock \) and providing my own full size nori sheets	20
0	first off i cannot believe how mad this game has made me i like all kinds of games but honestly trying to figure out some of the levels in this game left me stumped it 's one thing to be stuck somewhere and have to retry a lot but several times during this game i was stuck in an area and had no idea where to do what to do etc even after i killed all the bad guys i did n't know how to get out of the room this game is not intuitive \( sp \? \) at all ! secondly this game should not be called the incredibles it should be called mr incredible because you play as him almost all the time playing as elasta girl is great i really enjoyed that part but when there are a lot of baddies with guns mr incredible is a pain since he has no way to block anything so you spend a lot of time getting pushed back until the bad guys reload i liked the first mission as dash \( when you play as dash which is only twice \) you have to run fast however the second mission i just lost my patience because i had to restart about a million times because i could n't see what was ahead of me playing a violet was bad they should have done a lot more with her instead of a boring stealth mission the incredi ball mission incredibi sucked it took me like an hour to hit something because it was in a difficult place i'm just finishing up the game now and quite frankly i haven 't enjoyed a lot of it which is a shame because i really loved the movie some of the levels are too hard because you can barely find the way to do something and mr incredible needs to do more than punch people currently i'm on the rocket silo level and i keep falling down trying to get onto a platform what a load of fun that is to do 100 times or more bottom line playing as elasta girl was fun everything else was either blah or made me want to swear a lot hopefully the second game will be better i 'll be renting that instead of buying this game left me disappointed overall	20
0	it is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head it skims the surface and is 'pop' anyone reading this would be entertained but be none the wiser about what is going on in the real world again it is a shame if this is all people have to read on what is going on in the world \( newsweek is exactly the same \) especially in the united states time magazine is from the same people that gave us cnn and is unfortunately symptomatic of the liberal media and the inexorable consolidation of all media particularly in the u s and the resulting blandness and lack of real choice the other irritating thing about time is it 's tone which is patronising and a little supercilious subscribe to the economist there are less pictures !	20

1	tazo 's chai black tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part on the paper tea packet tazo writes a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the himalayas on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of chai as cinnamon creamy sweet spice and medium bodied yet full flavored with the spicy kick of cinnamon ginger cardamom and black pepper tazo describes the aroma as sweet spice those are pretty accurate the black tea blend is a little bitter though even with minimal brewing it 's a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter the ingredients in chai are black teas ginger cinnamon black pepper cardamom cloves and star anise it is caffeinated tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo chai gets only four stars	20
0	we subscribed to this magazine in part due to the special offer of 12 free cycling booklets road log with each new subscription what did we get \? a note letting us know that unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available and that rather than keep us waiting \( they 've \) taken the liberty of sending the enclosed substitute the substitute \? a crummy little pamphlet i let it slide at the time but several months later they were still offering this special promotion so i wrote a letter to customer service stating that since they now had the special gift perhaps they 'd be so good as to finally send ours no response time came to renew and all of a sudden there was that offer again so against my better judgement we did and guess what ! another note unfortunately the gift described in the promotion is no longer available and the same crummy pamphlet ! in short if you 're interested in being lied to or receiving a stupid little pamphlet by all means subscribe if you want what you paid for go somewhere else	20
0	egad ! upon receiving this remote control i found that it requires four aaa batteries there was no mention of that requirement in the product description ! i concur with the other review writer the control is top heavy and i would add poorly designed it 's thick at the top and thin at the bottom making it unwieldy i will be returning this monstrosity	20

1	this watch is pretty much exactly what you would expect from the picture the case is a bit thick and the backplate is plastic but that might reduce overall weight and compensate for the size it certainly does n't feel like the lead weight my fossil watches seem to be i have a smaller than average wrist and it was easily sizable down with the proper tools atomic time reception is good even as far south as i am and it rarely misses updates you can force an update if you feel like it and its really easy what is not easy is the initial setup i 've never had to really read a manual on most electronics but you will need it with this one keep that in a safe place for when the battery dies at least for now the price is a deal for the functionality and quality	20
1	the fabric in these slacks allow you to sit for hours and then stand knowing your slacks look neat and freshly pressed they wash beautifully and require little or no ironing my husband wishes all of his slacks wore this well the hidden elastic makes the slacks just as comfortable when you are sitting down or bending down as they are when you are standing frankly i wish i could find slacks for women that were this well made especially at the price hagaar offers haagar has done a terrific job again	20

1	okay i am new to the world of stargazing i purchased this telescope based on recommendations here at amazon com i have been completely satisfied i am especially impressed with the clear crisp viewing of the moon i can see a few planets but they are of course very small through the eyepiece i do have a suggestion to anyone who may purchase this telescope take your time putting it together read all the directions first pay special attention to the details concerning the collimator if you do n't know what that is you need to i almsot made some major mistakes screwing and unscrewing parts that needed to be left alone if you pay attention to all of the details on the instructions you will have the telescope together in a couple of hours and be well on your way to enjoying yourself especially on a clear night the package containing my telescope arrived in four days and was completely intact i could n't be happier with my purchase i am sure a more avid sky watcher might want a little something more but for the once in a while gazer this is the telescope see ya next review	20

0	this movie is not for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird sure there are plenty of plot holes reeves is in it so do n't expect an academy award however the plot is very interesting \( again filled with tons of holes \) but i watch a movie to be entertained not to be a film critic or to analyze everything overall if you like weird movies like fear and loathing in las vegas this movie is for you if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how true to life it may or may not be well just skip this one	20
1	the price at amazon was more than 5 less than my local target store the wax is a liqht liquid that 's not only easy to apply but easy to remove as well i was able to wax my mercedes convertible in about 30 minutes for best results i would use a microfiber towel to remove the wax and for a final polishing the shine is incredible and it leaves the paint feeling silky smooth although it 's only been a month since i waxed my car after 4 washings it still looks great this is certainly the best wax i have ever used i highly recommend this product	20
0	we ordered this case auto mount for our philips pet710 7 widescreen portable dvd player because it was the one recommended by amazon i needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler i eventually got this thing to work \( failure was not an option if you get my drift \) but it has a number of drawbacks in order to mount it you have to remove the top half \( huh \? \) having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose i accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when i drove away it 's too small the philips portable dvd player is too long for the case and the headphones and car ac converters also pull the player out of the case plus \( and this is really amazing \) it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the dvd player i have to carry the headphones and sleaved dvds seperately ! i chose my last dvd player b c it came with an auto mount case and even though i like the philips dvd player i 'd do that again if i had it to do over having the right case mount for your dvd player is that key	20
0	i thought i 'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all i was n't old enough at the time but i'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re emergence of friday the 13th tommy now a teenager \( and a bloody old one at that \) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of jason and also the death of his mother tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that jason is back from the dead and it seems he may be right when a series of murders begins but who could it possibly be this time jason is dead is n't he \? it 's up to tommy to fight his demons once again and get to the bottom of things before he himself becomes the victim of jason voorhees \? friday the 13th part 5 is a perfect example of how sequels in horror can ruin what went before the body count in this is ridiculously high and the gore itself leaves a lot to be desired was it really necessary \? is too much too much \? the only ounce of credibility in this film is harry manfredini 's reprisal musical score other than that you 'd be forgiven for skipping this friday the 13th entry	20
1	initially i had some trouble figuring out the right port to use but now it works and i 've used it constantly for at least 2 years	20
1	what is it with the british film scene and its distinctly gritty style it seems that if we 're not producing trashy ealing comedies it 's a shocking reality drama with the likes of ray winstone in it \? well ray winstone is n't in this one but he could well be as the rat catcher is another one of those 'you either enjoy challenging films or you do n't' pieces i personally love them i guess i must be a miserable bugger ! of course this film investigates the reality of the underclass dysfunctional life lived in a rough and grimey housing estate but it is unique \( well probably not unique \) in that it is told pretty much entirely from the view of the 12 year old boy played by william eadie who is struggling to make some sense of what is going on around him we learn that no matter what environment children grow up in they always seem to hold true and remain untainted somehow without wishing to give too much away it is the final brief scene of this film which has stayed in my mind ever since i watched it in 2000 worth the wait if you like being deeply moved by simple things	20
0	i started my newborn out using the avent bottles after a few weeks she began crying alot you could hear the gas moving in her tummy and every time her tummy would grumble she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain she would also pass gas constantly it was so difficult to feed her because she would cough spit and cry the whole time then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards i tried switching formulas did n't work tried mylicon zantac gripe water bicycling her legs etc etc etc nothing worked the pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do that she would outgrow it finally we decided to switch bottles \( i switched to playtex nursers \) instantly we noticed a difference ! she was extremely quiet during feedings did n't squirm or cry ! she began ingesting almost twice as much formula per feeding \( probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the avent bottles ! \) and would go longer between feeds and when she swallowed it sounded different you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air ! something about those avent bottles made her swallow tons of air i think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate with the playtex nursers the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats eliminating any air bubbles she is a completely different baby now she is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying so if you decide to buy these bottles beware if you are already using them and your baby has colic switch immediately ! do n't just assume that colic is normal or will be outgrown babies do n't deserve to suffer this way ! ! !	20
1	if you like hempseeds like i do this is your best buy amazon has the best price the seeds came fast fresh and are terrific to me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages the 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed i took 5 mason jars packed them in and put them in the freezer i have a big bag in the refrigerator i toss these seeds all over my salads	20
1	miele makes a great vacuum and this is one for sure but i want to recommend the seller witbecks wonderfully personalized and caring service from someone whose last name is actually witbecks when dhl screwed up their delivery \( an immensely crappy organization but that 's another story \) he stepped in and sent another unit without delay terrific guy terrific price terrific service	20
1	at first i had my heart set on a different cloak but when it was no longer available i decided to go with this one i am very pleased that i was not disappointed this cloak looks and feels beautiful it has a nice button closure at the neck and for those that are petite it is floor length this cloak is just what i was looking for to add a last minute touch to my halloween costume it is very comfortable and soft no itchy feel here	20

1	note this review is spoiler free with regards to the game 's storyall good things must eventually come to an end such as the star wars series the lord of the rings trilogy and the jak and daxter trilogy \( not including the racing game and daxter 's own psp game \) after two excellent games our favorite elfin friend and his furry sidekick come to the last entry in the jak trilogy the big question is is it a good ending \? i'm pleased to say that overall yes jak 3 takes place an undetermined time after the conclusion of jak 2 haven city has become divided after relentless attacks by robots metal heads and other nasties the population blames jak for these problems and he finds himself flown out to the wasteland a harsh and unforgiving desert where nobody can survive without help abandoned by those he saved jak and his buddy daxter set out on thier final adventure like it 's two predecessors jak 3 is a platforming game combined with a gun shooter you get various jumps kicks punches and leaps and you also get a wide array of firearms to take out your foes when your fancy kung fu and karate are n't enough jak 's moves remain largely unchanged from jak 2 \( which will now be called j2 \) he can still punch like a man jump like a kangaroo and leap like a bullfrog gunplay remains pretty much the same as well you get four guns \( blaster rifle machine gun and peacemaker \) but in a nice twist each weapon gets various upgrades as the game goes on the rifle for example starts out in it 's default setting hower the next upgrade allows it to shoot richochet bullets while the third upgrade gives it a flying platform that shoots bullets in all directions each gun has three upgrades and playing with them is a blast the peace maker for example can fire a shot that paralyzes all enemies and makes them float around \( whee ! \) while it 's final upgrade well let 's just say that you 'll be shooting mini nukes a lot the biggest change to jak 's game play comes in the form of vehicles while j2 had flying vehicles and zoomers jak 3 has cars \( and not the nice talking pixar kind \) because half the game is set in the desert jak and daxter get around on dune buggies there are eight of them and each has various unique traits some are really really fast one can jump riddiculously high \( wheee ! \) and some of them will spin out of control at the slightest twitch of the control stick \( boo ! \) you 'll be spending a lot of time driving the buggies and for the most part it 's enjoyable and fun though some of them \( such as the sand shark \) can be a bit difficult to handle another new feature of jak 3 is the sheer size of it j1 and j2 had two enormous areas to run around in here you have not one not two but three yes three ! gigantic areas to run around in and like the previous games there are no loading times an astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds \( spargus city the wasteland and haven city \) are you 'll definatly see a lot of amazing sights during your trips throughout jak 3 's world \( such as how haven city has ahem changed since the last game \) dark jak powers return as well but are now balanced by a new side to our hero light jak if dark jak is the attacking force light jak is the defensive force dark allows you to kill things really quickly while light allows you to heal fly \( this is so awesome ! \) surround yourself with an inpenetrable shield and even slow down time to a crawl both powers can be activated at any time as long as you have light and dark eco in your meters and in a very nice touch you can stop being light or dark at a touch of a button to save your energy for when you really need it while both light and dark do come into play at vital moments during gameplay both are really just a little added bonus to spice up gameplay when you want to as you can play throughout the game without needing to use either force \( except for scripted moments where you need to \) but then again being able to heal yourself whenever you want is a very handy thing ! smile like j2 jak 3 has you going from place to place talking to people and doing what they tell you to do and when you finish with that you head over to the next person and do what they want to do etc it 's a linear system that makes it easy to tell where to go and what to do next and it sounds fairly restrictive but it does have one big strength you do n't have to start the next mission until you want to if you want you can wander around the wasteland blowing up wanderers for twenty hours go hunt down twelve precurser orbs and watch the sun go up and down three times and then tackle the mission this free roaming system allows you to do what you 'd like to do if you do n't feel like doing missions for a while one thing i 'd like to address before we go any further is the difficulty level if one takes a look at my review for j2 one can find a lot of anger and hatred directed towards naughty dog for making j2 the most unnecessarily hardest game i 've ever played \( and it still is by the way tied only with spider man for ps2 \) i am very pleased that naughty dog towned down the difficulty a lot for jak 3 no longer does each and every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it and no longer will you be throwing the controller into the tv while screaming obscenities becuase that a hole errol won that fricken race again here the difficulty seems just right not too hard not too easy most missions require a few attempts before they are completed and a few can be finished on one try there are still a few that are quite difficult and one or two that are grit your teeth inducing but overall nothing as infuriating as many moments from the previous entry in the series oh and there are only a few go through the ring missions this time around thank goodness in addition to the free roaming gameplay there are also plenty of secrets to unlock in this quest there are over 600 precurser orbs to find and collect in jak 3 and by doing so you get to unlock various features such as unlimited dark and light jak power invincibility extra vehicles various weapon upgrades etc while some are hidden behind corners many of these orbs are collected by doing various challenges that people throw your way such as searching around a paticular area going through rings \( grumbles \) following a little blue light and even stopping time there are plenty of things to do to get those little shiny orbs but the results are well worth it in addition jak 3 arguably has the best moments in the series in terms of wow factor fighting a gigantic sixty story tall monster with only a dune buggy is a moment that sends shivers down your spine even with all these fine points jak 3 does stutter a little bit in what is arguably the most important part of the game the story j2 is most memorable to me for it 's story it had many twists and turns and you never really knew what to expect next the story in jak 3 is a good one and it does keep your interest in what is going to happen next but ultimitly it left me unsatisfied how so \? the three biggest ones are charachters the precursers and the ending and for those of you worrying that i'm going to tell you who the precursers are \( which i wo n't \) i'm going to keep this as spoiler free as i can first off the charachters we have jak and daxter of course and those two are always fun to watch and care about we have many returning charachters such as torn sig and samos and we have some new residents from spargus city the problem \? almost all of the returning charachters have zilch charachter development it 's assumed that you know them from the last game and because of that jak 3 takes no time to explain who they are or what they do that may be okay but pretty much none of the charachters are expanded at all torn is still gruff and tough \( but not as much as last time \) ashelin is the firm leader and samos gives warnings on what may happen to the planet if things go badly keira who was such a vital charachter in j1 and j2 has absoloutly nothing to do in the story aside from look pretty and important sig well he 's just there because he 's cool the only returning charachter who kept me interested was tess who fufills the dumb blonde role her relationship with daxter is sweet and lighthearted and kept my interest easily errol returns as well \( though i wo n't say how \) but he 's gone from insanely irritating to average irritating a sad departure from his compellingly egotistic nature in j2 of the new charachters only one damos kept my interest due to his charachter tough yet gentle and caring at the same time he 's easily the most compelling of jak 's new companions the new villian count veger is n't that compelling though he does have some very powerful scenes \( especially one near the ending \) one of the claims on the back of the game box is that we 'll discover the shocking secret of who the precursers really are as i said earlier i wo n't reveal who the precursers are \( someone did that and ruined the suprise for me \) except that in my personal opinion we should have never find out who the precursers were and leave them as a mystery i personally felt that seeing who they really are sucked out all the suspense and mystery esepcially since they have been talked about at length for two games now it 's like revealing the face of doctor claw when you go back and experience your old memories there is no more mystery or wonder anymore in my personal opinion these beings should have remained hidden forever however the saddest part of the game for me is the ending again i wo n't ruin it for you but it 's always sad when game developers have to wrap an entire trilogy up in three minutes some people criticise the ending of the film return of the king saying that it goes on too long however the ending to the lord of the rings film trilogy took it 's time wrapping up the threads from three movies and bringing closure to the story and leaving one satisfied however jak 3 does n't do that as the game goes on and gets closer to the end the feeling of dread and the idea that everything can be destroyed just vanishes and is pretty much gone by the time the final boss battle comes \( and sadly the battle itself is n't that exciting or memorable \) the ending does end the trilogy but leaves the door wide open for more games \( of which two have already happened \) i 've invested a lot of time on these three games i 've grown attatched to it 's charachters and i would like closure to all thier stories saldy that does n't happen everything is left wide open when in my opinion it should have been closed there is no real ending here at least one that ties everything up nicely but despite my points with the story i do want to stress that jak 3 is a very good game it 's a satisfying blend of storytelling platforming shooting driving and action it 's one of those games where you keep saying just five more minutes just five more minutes only to discover that time has flown by and it 's two in the morning it 's addictive fun and for me a blast to play i definitly recommend it especially if you find it for under twenty dollars	20
1	i finally got a ds and one of the first older games i tried to hunt down for this wonderful system was phoenix wright i 've been jonesing for this game for awhile now it 's unique and entertaining the choices for the court sections can be kind of linear but it 's too much fun to not love this title this is the type of game that makes the ds so unique and proud to say that i own this system more games should take note and follow in it 's footsteps this is a must buy for any ds library other titles in this type of catagory that are must buys are trauma center and trace memory this system was made for these types of games these games are why i will always trust in nintendo for high quality and interesting games game on !	20
0	this watch was of such poor quality that the second hand fell off by the third day of use the cost of shipping to claim a defect under warranty was more than the initial cost of the watch a total disappointment and waste of time and money do n't buy this watch	20

0	if a suspense filmed was played in the woods and it did n't actually contain any suspense would a bear watch it \? the previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making domestic disturbance the newest `thriller' starring john travolta vince vaughn and teri polo let 's talk for a few minutes about mr travolta can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them \? i think that travolta has now surpassed richard dreyfuss as the comeback lose it again king after a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer quentin tarantino in pulp fiction travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices face off and broken arrow highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed travolta to join the 20 million club in the last few years every film travolta has appeared in has failed miserably lucky numbers \? the general 's daughter \? that film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it \? swordfish \? interesting but a flop battlefield earth \? why does he keep making this trash \? it has to be the paychecks i ca n't see any other conceivable reason john baby how long before the studios realize that these films are n't making any money and they stop hiring you \? john baby how long before you need another comeback vehicle \? frank morrison \( john travolta \) is a divorced father who makes wooden boats he does n't get a lot of business but the business that he does get gets a great deal he does n't charge his customers enough to make a profit frank does this because he is the good guy his son danny \( matthew o'leary \) has a lot of problems accepting his mom 's \( teri polo \) new relationship with rick barnes \( vince vaughn \) he gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone a couple of days after his mom and rick get married he stows away in rick 's car and witnesses him murdering a business associate the police do n't believe him however after a little soul searching frank believes his son he may lie to everyone but he does n't lie to frank directed by harold becker \( sea of love \) domestic disturbance is a suspense film without any suspense from the moment danny stows away in rick 's car and watches him murder ray \( steve buscemi \) which we also watch we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is to make matters worse frank instantly believes his son which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between frank and rick a boring cat and mouse game when you know the identity of the villain a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet when frank believes danny early on the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it the film would 've been greatly improved by showing danny in the backseat of the car watching everything the pain and suspense registering on his face while the audience sees nothing then when danny tries to convince his dad the police chief his mom that rick is a murderer at least we have n't seen the act and we would require some convincing as well because the filmmakers chose to show us everything the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have frank doubt danny his son however after a very brief segment frank believes danny causing us to watch a battle between frank and rick which is n't very interesting each of the actors including travolta are serviceable in their roles but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium skip domestic disturbance it is n't even worthy of a video rental go to see the far superior and very different amelie or the man who was n't there your money will be much better spent	20

1	going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my a900 making it less high maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing headset using and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the oem battery decides to die at the most inopportune time quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind it 's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars what ! \? aside from the piddling cost of this battery \( which is about double the tax you 'd pay on a battery at a sprint dealership \) there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside to me this is not insignificant but is ignorable as it does n't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing talking or using the buttons	20

0	i ca n't beleive this guy 's arrogance to try and re record songs that are essentially and always will be sinatra 's domain any idiot will tell you that once sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him fact ask tony bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you sinatra is the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better not only does he murder 'a very good year' but also attempts \( badly \) 'mr bojangles' even attempting to ape sammy davis 's mannerisms i had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a \) a joke or b \) a blantant attempt by williams to crossover to boarder appeal now i see it actually meant it robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please do n't attempt the rodgers and hart songbook \( though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs \) your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover ca n't cover up your mediocrity the only time i 'd like to see you swing is from a lamppost stick with 'songs for swinging lovers''come fly with me' to hear the real thing an insult to classic songs	20
0	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter	20

1	unfortunately it is too short and easy along with the lack of depth to the game and the story mode is a bit weak however they make up in that with the classic mode and what else is great about this game is that its still highly addicting even after a year of use while most others are forgettable a month or two after purchase i reccomend you buy this rather than thug1 or thaw i garantee you will enjoy this game for a while	20

1	i am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera i have had all types of cameras over the years mostly 35mm film canon slr 's i too bought all sorts of these 5 7 mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love slr 's i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i ca n't keep my hands off of it it lacks nothing although the kit lense is good i bought a 28 135 canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo 's with it i love the way you can use the 7 points to focus i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now do n't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a wonderful new feature like low light or non shake this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you ca n't outgrow it its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be it wo n't hold you back the battery life is great the built in flash is good but i bought a 430ex and that 's even better i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come i always missed my 35mm canon slr 's and now feel that i have an old friend back again only much much better believe me you ca n't go wrong getting this camea its beyond description	20

1	i have seen many historical war dramas from far east \( mainly china 's \) and most of them are not only historically inaccurate but have a strong bias toward the enemy yi soon shin however is a rare exception not only is the drama very historically accurate but it is also very comprehensive in detailing the meticulous battle planning of the admiral that leads to each victory but also the political in fighting between the chosun political factions \( and the second guessing nature of the king \) which causes his eventual death also the special effects are great the battle scenes \( whether on sea or land \) are realisitic and of outstanding quality the only problem that i can find is that the dvd has not placed sufficient focus on the contribution of the ming china then again this is not unexpected since this is a korean drama focusing on the great admiral also the entire selection should have 104 episodes i do n't know why it stops at 101 if you want to have a more comprehensive knowledge on the subject try samuel hawley 's imjin war \( which portrays yi soon shin more accurately by quoting original sources \) any who is only intered in the fighting may also want to check out stephen turnbull 's samurai invasion \( which has more colorful maps and detailed description of battles from the japanese perspective \) lastly anyone who is a fan of samurai warfare may want to check out shogun total war by creative assembly \( now in gold version \)	20
1	while the ps2 version is not really bad it is horrible next to the near perfect versions on the xbox and pc the ps2 's sound and music to max payne is uneven and really scatchy when the narrative scenes are on the gameplay is still good even though some areas are cut off do to the ps2 's limitations but that does n't hurt the gameplay too much graphics are also very scratchy and so are the characters even though all the versions of max payne do n't have great character models the ps2 version looks even more out of order but the controls are better for ps2 the smaller controller the ps2 has really helps compared the xbox controller and a keyboard still highly enjoyable the game is still an intense action game with a lot of violence if you ca n't get your hands on any other version then the ps2 is perfect for you	20

1	this is an upscale designer water bottle top of the line and so much fun the designs of sigg 's water bottles are gorgeous from the plain solid color bottles to the ones with intricate designs they are simply beautiful ! i switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns thinking it would take more work to maintain these do necessitate regular cleaning \( i clean mine every day \) but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun sort of like my rings glasses and watch i now consider my sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory reminding me to drink more water making a statement about my values and expressing myself with a special design yes all in a water bottle ! sigg of switzerland water bottles are very high quality made of light aluminum on the outside slightly insulated and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles they are light durable and perfect for any activity well water tastes spectacular in these bottles just like from the tap sigg bottles come with several different types of tops i bought the screw top because i do n't like sports tops and i do n't mind unscrewing the top when i want a drink it is totally leakproof which is important to me the top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner i get comments on it all the time what 's that \? i love it ! the sports top version is ok i just am not a fan as i do n't feel like i can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top however for convenience you might prefer it for children there is a cap type top all are leak proof if you are ever unsatisfied with the top you can buy a screw top separately to fit your sigg bottle sigg makes their personal water bottle in 6l and 1l in this style i have both i use the 6l for sports activities because they are smaller when i wo n't have to carry the container i like the larger bottle sigg also makes a smaller 3l bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people you can buy siggs in alternative sizes too such as 75l 4l \( for kids \) 6l 5l you can occasionally find this bottle in the 1 5l size also search amazon for the perfect size pick a style and pattern you like as this bottle is a personal accessory and should reflect your style the colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on amazon they are expensive but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years i consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health so they are well worth it value wise for me highly recommended	20
1	i'm 15 and i have star wars battlefront 1 and 2 star wars knights of the old republic 1 and 2 this game and i'm getting lego star wars in the mail any day now i really like star wars battlefront 2 and star wars knights of the old republic 1 but this is a game that is hard to place as to how much i like it i got this game 2 days ago after work at like 2 pm and i played it until like 1 am and then i woke up the next day at about 9 am and i beat it at maybe 1 pm so it took me about half a day to beat i was really mad when i beat it because i was having fun and it just suddenly ended and it was a really stupid ending too ! the good you have a really good control over your squad with a variety of different orders such as telling a squad mate to set up a sniping position in one spot or telling your slicer to slice open a door for you this is good so that you dont have to do everything yourself and you dont have to rely on your squad to give you covering fire when it takes a whole minute to slice into a computer data base the weapons are pretty sweet and they are ones that you have never really seen before \( except for maybe thermal detonators or a wookie bowcaster \) if you become incapacitated you can tell your squad to come revive you or if you do n't feel like fighting tell them to just maintain their current orders and revive you after the fighting is done the way to heal yourself is a bacta station which i think is better than running over a health container the ai is good so your squad actually knows how to fight the bad the game is a lot shorter than i expected with only about 3 different planets ships there are only about 5 different enemies battle droids super battle droids trandoshans geonosians and magna guards the enemies all act the same in every battle super battle droids are really annoying in a fight because they are really tough to beat if you just have a blaster rife \( unless you 're a noob and play it on easy \) telling your squad to do things gets repetative after a while the ending sucks once you beat it you can only play the game over on a harder setting which is not really that fun or play with your friends on multiplayers which is n't fun either so you just put it back on the shelf for a while until you 're bored and feel like playing it again so all in all this is a really fun game until you beat it so i suggest that you pace yourself	20

1	if you 've ever made beer can chicken then you know what a problem it is sometimes to get the chicken to sit properly on the grill with only a beer can for support the weber poultry roaster solves this problem and goes several steps further to result in a moist tender and absolutely delicious chicken this item gets 5 stars and two thumbs up ! ! the pan has a well in the center to hold the beer this by the way uses less liquid than traditional beer can chicken which leaves more of the golden nector for other purposes such as drinking for those who prefer to do so the medieval torture looking prong device sits over the beer well and the chicken in turn sits on this weber includes a round cap that fits on the top of the chicken to help seal in the moisturizing juices the pan then sits in the grill and collects the chicken drippings thus keeping the grill cleaner the chicken sits very securely in this pan with no chance of opening the grill to find it had fallen over the non stick coated surfaces make this roaster pretty easy to clean up especially for something that 's been sitting in the grill for an hour or so we 've used this roaster several times and are still just as thrilled with it as we were on day 1 the chicken always comes out so moist tender and flavorful it 's hard to believe it was grilled ! i highly recommend this roaster in fact i 've even given them as gifts	20

1	i have been using microsoft operating systems for a very long time and i still say that this is the best system out there for many reasons an increasing amount of linux and mac users have made the claim that they are more compatible with programs and are less vulnerable to virus and hacks in response to linux users stay away from linux linux is free for a reason it is compatible with very very few programs as it is and that number will only decrease for gamers rarley do i see a linux compatible game just stay away from this system for mac users mac 's also have a lesser amount of compatible programs fewer and fewer programs can run on them and like linux that number will only decrease the only thing keeping macintosh alive is itunes which is compatible with windows besides when direct x 10 comes out it will only be available for windows making macintosh 's un usable for new games when the next windows os comes out \( microsoft vista \) the computers are also generally more expensive than windows btw you can get viruses on mac 's	20
1	for many who like writing html xhtml code homesite holds a special place in the heart it just feels so right and is addictive the tool can be extended and the extensions use script which makes the development cycle dead easy support from macromedia has not been good now adobe is in the process of buying macromodia \( as on 2005 04 19 \) so who knows where it all goes saying that people who like this product still like it and prefer it if it fits you do n't need support you just run it day after day and it works great \( there are alternatives emerging after all these years but none quite do it yet cse and topstyle are two that are coming along \) for some it almost seems perfect for wysiwyg oriented people it might be best not to even look at it	20
1	this is the story of two tazo teas i found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality i tried each tea separately and finally blended them together tazo lotus and tazo wild sweet orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer the way i make this tea is by steeping two lotus and two wild sweet orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water then you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea drinking this blend is an aromatic experience lotus decaffeinated green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors wild sweet orange is a blend of lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root and licorice root i love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents the boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful a romantic tea with a golden orange color i can never decide if i like this best hot or cold so i end up drinking it hot and cold half on ice and half in a mug when this tea is hot it is much more romantic and aromatic when chilled it takes on a more bitter component for something even more exotic try the tazo green ginger tea the rebecca review	20
1	i bought the cooler for my dell inspiron which tends to get hot because i work it so hard it 's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically is very sturdy yet light enough for me so i bought another \( wide screen \) \( black \) version for my hp pavilion which has more ram and so does n't have to work that hard now its internal fan virtually never kicks in in both cases the fan is so quiet that i have to turn it on off to make sure that it is working the only improvement i would suggest is more usb ports 4 stars because 5 is perfection	20
1	i'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only so so i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i'm very happy	20

1	this is quite a sharp turn from francine 's previous album \( 40 on a fall day \) whereas the last album was closer sonically to frontman clayton scoble 's work in poundcake this time around it 's quieter subtler sweeter and sadder make no mistake this is a break up album even those songs that make no mention of breaking up leave you with that cold lonely hug craving feeling only the best break up albums can the mood will draw you in and keep you listening but after a few listens it 's the songs you 'll fall in love with ahh the songs they 're densely packed with chord changes odd but appealing lyrics and unexpected instrumentation they 're hooky without being obvious \( a francine specialty \) this was my favourite album of 2003 and i still listen to it pretty often these days best tracks this sunday 's revival silver plated 606 novelty 13 years best lyric read a year old mail now you should 've told me i 've been repeating myself only far less convincingly	20

1	i'm a former 35mm photographer who 's a little older and not as spry as i once was and i eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere i went i got re energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more digital slr 's are pricey and as a friend pointed out i 'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her she recommended this model and the more i looked at it the more i liked it it is a fixed lens model but with a 12 1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need it start up fast zooms and focuses internally so there is no moving barrel to have to hold on to it has just about every feature an advanced amateur could want it does macro and it has an optical stablization system that works as advertised so far i have n't come across anything that it ca n't do this is a nice unit for an advanced amateur or even semi pro who does n't want to go full digital slr yet	20

1	i recently bought this read with me dvd system after much hesitation from other reviews it was on sale at toy r' us for 18 so i decided that i would go ahead and try it i took the advice of one of the reviewers and waited until my daughter went to bed to program it to be honest it took me longer to get it out of the package than to program it the system was programmed in less than 5 minutes and i have a pioneer dvd player that is over 5 years old the only thing i would suggest besides waiting until you child is asleep is not to lay the dvd control perfectly flat or it will be lower than the eye on the read with me dvd system my daughter absolutely loved it ! the reason i gave it 4 out of 5 is because wish they had a few more dvd available in stores	20

1	i purchased this hairdryer after my professional conair yellowbird from the late 70 's broke i definitely wanted another conair and i wanted to move into the 21st century ! i did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price i was n't disappointed as the other reviewers have stated this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time ! it 's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are dry brushing your hair it does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim otherwise it is very solidly built and i hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years	20
1	this book is a really excellent source for anyone wanting to understand the reasons that saudi arabia is the way it is today i was lucky to find my copy in a used bookstore it does get a little tedious when discussing the business oil aspects of the 1960 's and 70 's but it 's well worth it it 's a detailed history from start until publishing and that is definitely a relevant time	20
1	the magnet is solid the frame wiggle perfectly to make it clic and fit just like the picture shows lenses are clear and functional however they need to give a bit more space to accomodate larger heads since it can get snug and this is not your usual glasses notice that the frame encircles the head making head size an issue on the plus side the glasses wo n't fall off when you bend forward they stay around your neck after you unclick 'em and they are functional	20
0	i first became a fan of the gorillaz with their excellent 2nd cd demon days the interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so out there that when you first hear one of their cd 's it sounds like complete garbage but once you listen again and again you start to like it more and more eventually you end up really liking the cd that was the case with demon days after enjoying that cd fully i thought i should check out the first gorillaz cd and i did n't like it all that much there just seems to be very little actual songs on the cd way too much of it sounds like complete filler there were a couple throwaway songs on demon days but most of the stuff on that cd was great here we 've got songs that are just boring nothing happens i was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs but it never happens you just listen to 2 d whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background \( such as on songs like new genious man research and starshine \) some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all sometimes sounding just like static noise songs like this such as double bass are cool for a minute or two but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes it gets boring other songs like 5 4 m1 a1 and rock the house are catchy at first but just do n't have staying power they get old 5 4 got annoying quickly m1 a1 and punk lost their appeal quickly and rock the house is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it and songs like latin simone are just annoying the remixes of 19 2000 and clint eastwood that end the cd are also fairly forgettable although 19 2000 's kind of catchy on the first couple listens there are some good songs here though tomorrow comes today clint eastwood gravity 19 2000 and left hand suzuki method are cool songs slow country 's kind of cool too and dracula 's got an awesome almost haunting sound to it and it 's really absorbing although it too unfortuantely loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it this small collection of good songs though is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks much of this cd just is n't really that good i do n't know this cd just seemed empty very few meaningful tracks lots of filler and some really annoying and repetitive songs some good songs were stretched to almost 5 minutes long mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs clocking in at 72 minutes \( which makes it 22 minutes \( ! \) longer than demon days \) this cd was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff people interested in the gorillaz should pick up their superior follow up demon days instead of this one if i listened to this debut cd first i probably would n't have ended up liking this band very much the good news about this is that the gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump their cds are getting better not worse that is a great sign for the future of this awesome band	20
1	it def is very sturdy does n't move around once you strap it on to the chair and it looks good too \) i'm very happy with this chair the contoured seat back really hugs the baby yet doesnt constrict his arms i love the size of the tray and the size of the cupholders i find it very easy to hand wash as the bottom only needs a good rinse my son has n't gotten food under there yet i ca n't wait to use it as a booster seat	20

0	i have been reading this mag off and on for the past 20 years as other reviews have said i think i am just reading the same tired old stuff from three or four issues ago big guns ! huge chest ! massive gains ! these seem to be the ones you 'll see featured about every other month in here as for adds \? do n't get me started on adds ! when half of your magazine is adds it spells trouble not only that they need to specify to people who may not already know this mag 's training tips are for people who do not work for a living and can spend 6 8 hours a day in the gym eat 8 10 meals a day and spend massive amounts of cash on supplements in other words people with no real responsibilities other than taking care of their physiques \( which as far as jobs go that 's a great one to have \) i teach all day and into the night literally for me to eat and train like they require i 'd have to quit my day job sell my kids into slavery and become a homeless person in which case i 'd have no money to have a gym membership i think you get the idea on the positive side the photos are awe inspiring also to be realistic it 's a mag that has been around for decades upon decades how many different ways can you say lift heavy eat like a horse and train like you have no other responsibilities in life \? it just becomes repetitive any way you slice it my recommendation would be to buy an issue or two every decade or so buy january 's big guns issue and then february 's huge chest then wait a decade and repeat good luck	20

1	we must thank the director and salute sigourney weaver 's beautiful performance this movie gives us a rare insight into the lives and minds of the gentle yet ferocious giant mountains gorillas it is also the amazing journey of an extroardinary woman who went to live by herself in a remote mountain of rwanda secluded from the world she lost much of her sanity as well as her life in the process of saving the lives of a few hundred remaining gorillas without her work who knows who could have saved them from savage murder and total extinction \? thanks to her work and dedication a lost cause had been heard at last the struggle for the survival of the great apes is not totally over though one must hope that the abject poverty and the political unrest that still affect the region as well as the illegal poaching and smuggling of goods and animals across borders that happen with or without government officials' approval in each country involved and the continuing deforestation and fauna 's loss of habitat can one day all come to an end so that the survival of these amazing creatures can be achieved one must recognize the sacrifices and thank people like diane fossey conservationists around the world and the rwandese people in particular who have made it possible so far despite great internal economic and political pressures all hope is not lost !	20
0	as i watch the videos of my kids on my 50 plasma 32 lcd and mac trying to convince myself that i like the quality my wife walks by and says fuzzy i know most guys out there will know what i'm talking about she just killed the deal regardless of the specs the wives do n't lie the picture quality just does n't cut it it 's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old sony dvr the product design is cool the price is good the sd card recording idea is perfect but the hd promise does n't come close to paying off if you 're looking for sharp crystal clear images you 're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle	20

0	i loved this item at face value it looks good the materials are good quality it feels secure and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what i wanted because i planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by i was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came well the mattress that comes with it is so hard that my baby wo n't sleep in it she wo n't nap in it and when i put her down all she does is cry i 've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would but she wo n't sleep in it at all i 've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that i tuck in the sides \( something i do n't want to do because of the sids factor \) and that does n't even help it 's still too hard of a surface now my baby is sleeping in bed with me and i ca n't get any sleep because i'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed if they 'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby this would be a perfect product and i 'd rate it a 5 but because it 's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress board i have to rate it only 2 stars i'm so let down by this product	20
0	i must say that i had to return my atdec wall mount cuz it 's made in a cut corner way that should be rejected vesa measurements are 75mm or 100mm and usually 100mm we would be using this atdec wall mount has one piece 100mm but the second part is only 75mm so it has the smaller 75mm screw ins on my 2 lcd pc monitors the monitors had 100mm screw fittings so i was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall this made the piece on the wall set in w small distance between screws ifelt unsure and after turning my wall mounted monitor on off a few times the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen do n't buy this mount peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself	20

0	this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie 's fans live the life nowhere close to cher 's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty ! she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she 's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she 's like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out	20

1	the miernik dossier was shockingly good before this i had never read anything by mccarry in fact i had never even heard the man 's name i was lucky to come across a review of this re issued work in a magazine now i am collecting everything by him the story follows an odd assortment of people some of whom may or may not be intelligence agents as they travel south through europe into africa for the entire length of the book you will be wondering and guessing and probably changing your mind many times as to who is working against whom and trying to figure out if miernik is who he says he is the writers of the dossier themselves seem to be unsure in that sense the miernik dossier has similar elements to a mystery or detective novel but yet it goes way beyond that it is also a highly compelling character study with each of the group drawn intricately by the author so that you come to know the characters this makes it all the more suspenseful because these people who you seem to know or possibly identify with in some way may very well not be who you think they are the miernik dossier is a highly entertaining read true spy literature in the vein of ashenden that is enjoyable for those who enjoy spy stories mysteries or simply great writing i cannot wait to read this book again	20

0	i loved the 2006 version of this software but when i received an email offering an upgrade to the 2007 version i decided to improve what i had i could not be more disappointed the resulting product is a miserable failure and i'm amazed that some people are having good luck with it this version prints everything off center i can play with some of it to center it but not the hallmark logo etc on the back the result is a very unprofessional mess i went online to report the problem saw they have a faq on the issue promising that soon they will have a fix i can download three months later and still no fix i 've written nova 3 times they acknowledge the problem and issue the same automated response keep checking for updates finally after numerous emails and phone conversations they have agreed to let me return the software to them when i received the 2007 edition which in every other way was virtually identical to the 2006 version i threw away my old software i'm now thinking of purchasing it again because i found this software easy to use and loved to be able to make so many changes add photos etc maybe some of these do n't have this technical problem but just be warned	20
1	just today i randomly selected a movie that movie was henry i had never heard of it before and i figured that i was in for your average run of the mill low budget slasher flick though it is low budget it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie in fact the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study meet henry a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition watch as he goes to work watch as he hits the bar with his buddy otis and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people this film does not exploit the violence though it is very frank and direct treating it as though henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park this movie is a lot of things and when it was all over i just had to sit back and take a few breaths have a cigarette and try to gauge my reaction \( s \) i was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing it is also pretty funny in some parts though only funny in the blackest sense of the term there is no social commentary in this movie nor does it provide any closure the dvd is great awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer henry lee lucas awaiting lethal injection on death row very fascinating	20

0	this is an extremely dry anime the manga version by masamune shirow is filled with bits of humor not so for the anime the character batou was especially funny in the manga but for reasons unknown he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking these really make the movie crawl one minute there 's action next you 're listening to matoko or batou go on and on about existentialism seriously these little talks take up 3 4 of the movie the visuals are awesome no question about that even so they do not fulfill the need for some kind of thread of a story altogether not much actually happens during the movie if you must see it rent it first to be sure you want it	20

1	ahh the tekken series probably the most influential series of 3d fighting games outside of the virtua fighter games tekken 5 is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre with the 4th game just a distance memory this takes the series forward \( or back depending on how you look at things \) tekken 5 uses the tried and trusted tekken gameplay while still making everything feel fresh characters that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones are now fully fleshed out with moves of their own anna williams for example is now not a clone of her sister nina when people mention tekken they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their 'mad skillz' as it were making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre this i think is far from the truth tekken 5 welcomes new and veterans to the series alike whereas button bashing pretenders to tekken 's crown coughdeadoralivecough leave you feeling somewhat cold tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play yes tekken 5 has its button bashing characters but every single character is unique and how unique they look ! arguably the best looking ps2 game to date with gorgeous backdrops fluid realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next gen console music wise it 's back to form mix between techno dance we 've come to know and love from tekken the least we say about tekken 4 's music the better ! you 've got your usual story mode to run through with each character to see why they 've entered the tournament etc but this 5th edition borrows the human ai mode of virtua fighter 4 this has replaced the arcade mode in name and pits you against humans who have uploaded downloaded their data from the tekken arcade machine from all over the world it 's a welcome challenge even though it does n't even compare to facing a real life human opponent all in all this is the true homecoming of a master easily the best tekken to date and probably the best 3d fighter in existence though i am partial to abit of soul calibur heh	20

0	while visiting some family in utah a few years ago we decided to rent a few movies to pass the unforgivably hot mid summer weather we ended up renting analyze that and boy what a mistake that was ! we were expecting at least a mildly funny sequel to 1999 's analyze this the potential was there it 's not as if writers \( of course it 's never a good sign to see numerous writers \) peter tolan peter steinfeld and harold ramis did n't have decent material to work with robert deniro billy crystal lisa kudrow and a funny and entertaining plotline regarding mobsters and therapy however this being hollywood and all another sequel was botched it 's because of movies like these that sequels have such a bad reputation despite a few genuine laughs in the first twenty minutes or so regarding deniro and some fish out of water situations the movie seemed to go downhill soon after the jokes became few and between as the film laboriously plowed its way through an over the top heist setup and execution that felt about as inspired as crossroads now either they ran out of jokes they did n't have enough time to invest in an actual story or the material itself has been played out in so many different ways already \( the sopranos the whole 9 yards mickey blue eyes etc etc \) that there was simply nothing left to write about	20

0	after only 2 months this toy fell apart my daughter loves the toys on it but the turtle fell off and a metal screw was popping out and the snail 's threads came out and the stuffing our of the side started to come out of the seams 20 is not cheap for this toy and i think the quality should have been alot better	20
1	i am very pleased with my new salad spinner it can hold a large amount of salad which means i do not have to reload and do the work over and over the mechanism is easy to use and works smoothly i am also able to soak the salad in icewater in it and then drain it and spin all in the same piece of equipment	20
0	i wanted to like this bar because it 's high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars \( 31g ! \) it 's much too sweet if they took away some of the sugar it might be edible	20
1	i first saw this movie on tv as a college student i loved it so much that an old boyfriend went out and bought it for me on vhs tape i have watched this movie so many times i'm surprised the vhs tape is still working ! the actors are perfectly cast in the leads they are so believeable in their portrayals that i could have gone to high school with them the kissing scene is hot clothes do n't need to come off for you to feel the hot wind of chemistry and passion that blows off that first kiss scene the characters are not glossy and that is what i love about john hughes he portrays coming of age in all its naked and truest glory not the perfect airbrushed schlock that has come out in later years if you 're looking to see character development and great plot set to a great soundtrack this is your type of movie	20
0	i bought this cd not long after it came out it did n't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it ! ! ! i like somehow our love survives and abandoned garden other than that this is a mediocre effort for michael he has used this kind of brazilian theme on sleeping gypsy already stick with your roots michael you are from california not south america try buying blue pacific instead ! ! ! i abandoned this one a long time ago	20
1	good movie that you do n't have to think about while it makes you laugh	20
1	this is a 'must have' fragrance it has an exotic scent that will have everyone around you asking what perfume do you have on \? it can be worn day or night the entire burberry line is fantastic	20
0	this diaper pail is certainly the worst i have used it works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week i was ready to get a new diaper pail it does not keep oders in much at all and i do n't even put poopy diapers in it after about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it does n't do any good yes a plus is the using regular bags but so does the diaper champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this i'm definitely going back to the diaper champ i only bought this one because it was the only one at my store now i know it was worth the wait for the diaper champ in the mail	20
0	i purchased the ab lounge 2 online but returned it the same day it 's too bulky heavy i wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news but it 's too heavy to move around and it does not fold i put it together in my living room and then tried to get it into my bedroom but it wouldn't fit through the door i had to un screw the bars fold pull it through the door if i had put the ab lounge 2 downstairs then i would never use it unless you want the ab lounge 2 to be a permanent fixture in your bedroom or living room then i would order something else i need this thing to be where i can easily use it then put it away the ab lounge 2 is way too big bulky for that unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture then do n't buy it i'm buying the ultra ab lounge because it folds for easy storage it 's more expensive but to me it 's worth the convenience of having the easy storage capability i do n't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it 's not in use	20
0	my husband and i bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills well it did not control odor the plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week the odor escaped even when the pail was closed you do save money on refills at first but when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows you have to change the bag more often i used a lot of baking soda and lysol spray to help control the stink also the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things i would not recommend this product	20
1	brings back the good old days of playing these games after school	20
0	the title of this product is a joke it should be called not easy cd burning roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is it is way too complicated for burning simple cds	20
1	this is my first experience with sim city i 've never played with the earlier versions important note the computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the cd case well i looked and looked and it was n't where the prompt said it would be after five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me i finally found the code it 's on the back of the owners manual located inside the cd case you 'll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual not in the lower left corner the tutorials are helpful so if you 're new to all of this i highly recommend you go through those first and if you feel you need to go through them again you can reset the tutorials to start fresh all over i 'll built a small city and i 've only had this game for a day but i know i'm going to love it	20
1	i was looking for a double stroller that i could get in and out of my sedan easily i did n't like the tandems because they not only take up tons of space but they are also very heavy this stroller is light and i can take it in and out of my trunk with one hand plus because my kids are heavy enough to push i am not pushing an extra 25 pounds in stroller because it is side by side it can be a tight fit going through some doors but i have never been unable to get through a door my husband thinks that some of the parts are cheap and look like they can break easily but with 6 months of lots of use we have had no problems the sun visors have bent at an angle when storing but i can still use them fine and i like that they rotate down so you can angle them with the sun i am so glad that i bought this rather than a larger more expensive heavier tandem stroller	20
1	my kids love highlights ! it 's applicable to both of their age ranges \( 6 and 9 \) and is a valuable investment for any parent i do n't know what i would do without this magazine it keeps them entertained at restaurants and while we travel in the car not to mention it 's much cheaper than investing in portable gadgets that are out of date every few months	20
1	fabulous with eggs and bacon as well as steak ! have n't ordered it from amazon before now because it was n't available but we ate it with everything in england ! definitely authentic anglo cuisine	20
0	i cant understand how anyone can give this album more than one star luckily i got this cd for free when they were handing them out to everyone who came to their shows on their 2005 tour i love classic journey but this band has gone downhill faster than i ever thought possible most of the songs are terrible boring music and even worse lyrics 'arrival' was pretty mediocre but this is about 5 steps down from there granted steve augeri does complete justice to the old songs in concert and really sounds great but he obviously has nothing to offer in the way of songwriting the only way this band will ever create quality new music is if perry were to stop sitting around at home and come back to the band otherwise the band should seriously consider not making any more new music and just go on tour every couple of years	20
1	i have a briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot i have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema enjoy	20
0	i had got these for my husband for christmas nice material however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height so we had to return it	20
0	this movie is not a war movie it is not remotely related to history either guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history since when did american troops in ww ii carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers \? this depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell \? can we spell bushido \? mallick ca n't now if you like touchy feely not the real world aesthetique have at it the scenery and photography is quite good	20
0	i used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it 's just not good	20
1	i love this puzzle ! it is fun and challenging i believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge however i find that there is one problem with it there are no dimensions to tell you how big the puzzle is after you put it togrther ! ! ! i would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box i am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle if you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle i would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection	20
1	i used it in brasil and had it developed i was very happy with it it was the very first time i 've used a digital camera	20
0	another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought over produced and over rated rock band of all time did i mention over the top \? let 's face it queen was a group of crypto fascists working hard to put a human face on thatcherism ghastly stuff k	20
0	i read the reviews below and then went into the sharper image to test the product myself there is no resistance what so ever and i simply cannot immage getting a good workout from this product	20
0	this item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs i am tall with a 37 inseam this item is not made for someone who has longer than average legs unless you 're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage	20
1	i have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head the results are great no unwated shine no gooiness very easy to wash off your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged reasonably priced and more available every day	20
0	do not buy this magazine ! for any price it is too expensive marie claire has harassed me repeatedly to pay for my subscription it was paid for in advance thru amazon i have sent them copies of my amazon receipt twice they are reporting me to a credit agency for non payment avoid them avoid them they are scam artists and will falsely and with malice destroy your credit rating	20
0	i do like this t shirt i liked the organic cotton and the general style but i will never buy american apparel again not only are they very labor and union unfriendly their ads exploitive of young girls \( i mean i can tolerate some of the young models in general but these are particularly young girls in amature porn looking situations \) but a friend 's daughter had a particularly unsavory experience working in one of their stores i know i can find a cosy organic shirt elsewhere ick	20
1	i am very pleased with the quality of this product the only spice which i found can be used for all the recipies i tried it for simple vegetables to nice complex meat dishes and even sweets like ice cream and it worked great it a nice and balanced blend and saves u the time for blending different spices so just use this into any of the indian recipies and enjoy	20
0	i was very disappointed with this film it definitely had a more art house feel to it than i was expecting and like happens with many art house films sebastiane is light on plot and character development and heavy on scenery shots bad string music and slow motion nude shots \( but alas not even erotic ones \) the real story of sebastiane is a fascinating one how does such a man transform into the much beloved st sebastiane of the catholic church \? well do n't expect this movie to tell you there is as mentioned above no character development we are given an off handed explanation that sebastiane 's faith \( christianity \) was the cause of his eventual execution but any scenes of faith are oddly intertwined with a lot of roman flavored philosophical ideas references to roman gods and so forth very un catholic so while we know that it was sebastiane 's faith that lead to his execution this plot line is really dulled down to the point that there is no plot the other men on the island are nothing more than pretty bodies to look at their characters do not get developed at all \( the interaction conflict between sebastiane and the roman guard could have been so much more interesting and potent if jarman had fleshed out that character a little more \) also disappointing was that the eroticism of this film falls miserably flat now i realize that i am a female and this is a gay movie but i would like to think that i am as aroused by sexy nude men as much as any gay man would be well i was not aroused there are plenty of shots of nude men but the way that jarman shot the film is so stylized and stiff that it takes all the eroticism out of it i watched a slow motion scene of two nude men splashing in the surf and all i could think was gay men are actually turned on by this \? \? ! well this straight woman was bored about half way through the movie so my advice is do n't buy this movie for it 's story line or it 's erotic value there is none of either	20
1	aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout although ostensively devoted to art photography many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism if you are primarily interested in just art photography and can subscribe only to one magazine i would suggest blind spot	20
1	fast shipping great product very easy to use i highly reccomend this product if you dont want to deal with complicatedwiring and difficult to install alarms this products works fine and very easy to work with	20
0	sound was n't too bad for price tinny yes but cheap used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play cds and then it would n't turn on at all	20
1	smells great and it is wonderful especially the fact that it is three products in one	20
1	leo kottke is a national treasure he is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso having said that you 'd expect his cds to be at a very high level of brilliance i have at least a dozen of his titles if there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc it 's because there are so many kottke releases to choose from one guitar no vocals clearly ranks as one of the best the compositions tickle my brain warm my heart and put a bounce into my step the guitar playing is dazzling you really get a glimpse of the man behind the guitar by listening to this music brilliant thoughtful odd complex quirky a huge heart and the wackiest sense of humor it 's spirited music so thoroughly drenched in the personality of its creator that it 's unmistakably and immediately recognizable as leo the world is full of acoustic guitar instrumentalists these days some of them are quite excellent many are not but there is only one leo kottke and his guitar music is a gift to the world a very strong recommendation for this cd	20
1	this is one awesome game play it online or against the computer i do suggest online for more fun in the long run if you really wanna give yourself a scare turn out the lights and turn up the volume definetely the scariest first person shooter out there	20
1	i first heard dan singing background vocals on the jackson browne album late for the sky i was 16 i went out and bought this album \( which i still have ! ! \) even though i had never heard it i had the pleasure of seeing dan open for the eagles at the spectrum in support of this album in phila in 1974 i was a junior in high school they all joined in on best of my love and it just blew mw away he had this really interesting piece of cloth on his piano few people had heard of him prior to this album this is by far his best album it is more rock and roll than the rest of his sappy later work in the 80 's and a true songwriting gem i can remember singing morning sky in my friend 's ford on the way to school you have to listen to it over and over someone 's been tellin' you stories had a sly sexual rhyme in it that was not played on radio at that time the musicianship on this album only serve to enhance the quality of the songwriting this was the most raw of dan 's albums and by ar the most superior sadly dan is now fighting advanced prostate cancer \( check out his website \) let 's hope he will make a full recovery and record and tour again soon this is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any 1970 's rock and roll	20
0	this did n't do as well as an old microwve poper i 've used for yers it did n't showa great increase in kernals popped and they were not as light and crispy it is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs' which i could n't find in local stores since i gave several of the poppers as gifts i shopped on line for replacement 'power packs' for all and found the postage handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one \( incredibly light \) pack	20
1	my wife and i love this product now it 's not for backpacking but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove it does require one of those disposable propane tanks \( which can be tough to dispose of \) and it might make sense to get the carrying case \( not seeing it attached here \) but besides that a great simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions	20
0	as a professional photographer i find myself going through 5 6 of these cords each year my equipment is my livelyhood and although it is used often i am exceptionally careful with all of my gear and do not bang it around or abuse it i use a stroboframe which makes it necessary to use this cord to raise the flash well above the focal plane of the camera these cords are very expensive to get just a few months out of them eventually the hot shoe connector will either become loose and the connection will no longer function or the plastic connector will break and your flash unit will fall to the ground \( this has happened twice to me and fortunately i was able to catch the flash unit ! \) the cord is indespensible if you need it but contact canon usa and ask them to reengineer this cord or expect to replace them every few months	20
0	i think coffee taste is more of a personal preference but i was not fond of this decaf coffee i always drink my coffee black and i did n't get the rich coffee taste that i like with the don francisco brand illy has a great reputation so i am guessing their non decaf coffee is outstanding they just need a little work with the decaf	20
1	this is a difficult album to review people either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced overblown waste of their time however i can say that this is my favorite oasis album why \? that 's a very good question maybe because be here now was my introduction to oasis and i could tell that this band had a lot to offer even through the drug addled overproduced songs that seemed to last forever each one is very catchy and has an overall feel good quality to it two characteristics of most oasis songs it 's no use comparing be here now to morning glory or def maybe because it 's in a whole other ballpark this is oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit no doubt that all the coke helped with that it 's my firm belief that morning glory and def maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights be here now is just something else you either love it or hate it it has it 's own little oasis category i can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors there are some valid complaints about this album though one it is very very overproduced filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else unfortunately this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long two the songs are astonishingly long at times all around the world while an excellent song clocks in at around 9 20 i believe that the shortest song is i hope i think i know coming in at 4 23 so you know you 're in for a long wild ride however only oasis could pull this off making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear numbing to listen to and every minute is made enjoyable all the arrogance coke and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people and of course there 's that small note on the upper left hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims the beatles are quite good but oasis is much better and so a resounding yes to all of these overproduced arrogant drug induced staggering amazing excellent i do n't care about the negative things though because that 's what makes be here now a sucess in its own right	20
1	first if you 're thinking about using these photos for print you may wish to think again most objects run between 300 600 pixels in width or height or 1 2 inches at 300 dpi stretch them bigger than that and they 'll start to blur and or get jagged also note that if you try to export save an image from the hemera image browser and select the 300 dpi setting the browser may stretch the graphic larger than it 's actual size causing blurring and jaggedness right out of the gate you need to use the use image 's full size checkbox when exporting images if you specify a 300 dpi size and do n't use that checkbox you 'll get a stretched image for example the first image in the collection \( the pocket watch \) is only 384 pixels wide if you specify 300 dpi and do n't check the use image 's full size box the software will stretch it to 642 pixels wide the stretching will cause the image to look fuzzier and or more jagged when you use it in a web site or print project all that said if you 're going to use the images for the web they 're great you get almost all the images you 'd find in their three photo objects collections each of which is much more expensive than this single collection the difference is the photo objects collections offer about 20 30 higher resolution \( i e the first image in the collection is 384 pixels wide but is 492 pixels wide in photo objects \) and you can save the photo objects images with transparent backgrounds \( while this collection forces you to specify a color for the background \) for the price this is a good collection there are lots of shots with minor variations so it may seem like duplication but for someone trying to get something just right that slightly different tilt of the head may be just what the doctor ordered	20
1	i bought another one of these because i dropped my orginal at the grocery store and broke the bulb i tried contacting the company with this new one u cannot get an answer the company seems to have a non working number other than that the product ok and i havent been sick since i have used it	20
0	52 00 less weighted down by cash and i was on my way with what was the most expensive non video monitor available at the local target surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like clear reception and no interference i would be able to hear the baby 's every move from every household location and beyond we hooked it up in short order turned it on and screeeech apparently a volume level that might permit us to hear the baby one room away would also cause some sort of massive interference between monitor and reciever we tried shutting that monitor off and plugging the second in the kitchen outlet the entire length of the house away no screeching but it sounded like someone speaking from inside a tin can totally distorted useless you could n't tell if the baby was banging on her crib bars or if someone was moving heavy machinery about in her bedroom we 've packed it carefully back into the box and are hoping target will take it back without a fight needless to say i 'd steer clear of this one our 20 safety first monitor far surpasses this one even on its last leg	20
1	outstanding service product was as described and the price was fair mailing in a timely manner was acceptable will continue to shop for similar items via amazon	20

1	i have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road while playing sports to drink while i am in class the bottle washes easily in the dishwasher the narrower profile fits easily in cup holders i highly reccommend the n gen it is much larger than 24 oz if you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity it is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market you can also use the bottle as i have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack	20
1	this scale is quite accurate and easy to read the only problem may be that it can be a little touchy when trying to adjust the needle in order to use a different container	20
0	i bought the magazin on november and i do n't recive it yet	20
1	i have watched this movie again and again and i ca n't imagine a better carmen than rita hayworth ! her carmen is a free spirit proud sensual intelligent and yet vulnerable too glenn ford may have been slightly miscast as don jose but he and rita had such a chemistry that they make this film work what really sets this film apart though is rita 's fantastic dancing ! she was raised in the tradition of spanish dancing from the time she was about 4 years old she came from a famous family of renowned spanish dancers and it 's such a pleasure to watch her do what must have come so naturally to her no other dancer can match her for her sheer gracefulness and passion i 've only seen the dvd version of this movie so that 's the version i'm recommending the colors are luscious and the photography is clear and crisp and the musical score is very moving this film may very well become one of your favorites especially if you 're a rita hayworth fan	20
0	we bought this tractor from joe brands it was a big disappointment ! it was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the joe brands site when i contacted joe brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100 they refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them they told me i had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in wisconsin instead of back to joe brands in colorado i am in las vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to wisconsin instead of colorado when i bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping after i shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial free shipping and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund i am out over 100 because of joe brands if you buy from joe brands you may be sorry !	20
1	my children \( 4 6 \) love this game it is great because no reading is necessary the game asks the questions and even repeats them when necessary while my kids do n't know all the topics covered they enjoy the game the fact that the game makes sure they move the correct number of spaces is great too i definitely recommend this game and i will probably buy the next level of it	20
1	another stop motion animagic hit from the holiday entertainers of rankin bass studios the kings of holiday tv specials this 1 hour show was released for the first time on april 6 1977 on abc television network the storyline is very similar to santa claus is coming to town from the same studio and by that i meant that part of the story explains all the traditions of easter and how they began such as why we eat chocolate bunnies or why we color eggs the show opens with a newsreel showing kids asking these questions fred astaire reprises his role as the singing mailman s d kluger and gives a great voice performance but he has a bigger role this time he has traded in his snowmobile mail truck for the little engine that could voiced by robert mcfadden in the story we go back in time to the beginning of the children 's easter traditions to answer these questions to a hidden town called kidville there is a scary bear named gadzooks who hates holidays and he is similar to the winter warlock character a rabbit named sunny grows up to be the easter bunny and bring joy to children making great friends and allies along the way he is voiced by skip hinnant who voiced pogo in a special from another studio he befriends a lonely young king named bruce who is being controlled and bullied by his tyrannical aunt longtooth we have come to expect good music in these holiday specials and they did not disappoint there are 6 songs total with music by maury laws and lyrics by jules bass including the catchy someone 's got to be first along with big rock candy mountain the inspiring somebody will love you if you do and the easter bunny is coming to town today fred astaire sings all you have to do is think can do there is a hilarious song by the hendrew sisters what came first the chicken or the egg \? this very colorful special has terrific character designs by paul coker who did the same for most of the studios products the look of the film is well very easter they just did a great job capturing what the visuals should be for the kids this show is the 3rd and last of the easter themed holiday shows made by the studio in 1971 they made an hour long animagic tv special for abc here comes peter cottontail about the selection contest for the easter bunny and it actually travels through time to all the holidays in 1976 they made a half hour traditional cel animation special the first easter rabbit for nbc as you know rankin bass studios brought us such beautiful holiday tv classics such as rudolph the red nosed reindeer year without a santa claus `twas the night before christmas nestor the long eared donkey the little drummer boy frosty the snowman santa claus is comin' to town mouse on the mayflower cricket on the hearth the stingiest man in town rudolph 's shiny new year and more they also made non holiday films such as the hobbit and flight of dragons it is incredible that one company was responsible for all those tv specials 95 of the ones we see every year their work includes traditional hand drawn cel animation stop motion animagic and live action little golden books publishing owns the rights to almost every show the studio made and have done a commendable job re mastering them and releasing them on dvd i hope this comes out on a restored dvd too i have bought all the other rankin bass that has been released on dvd	20

0	i echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here the magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week how many times is a reader going to see no talents such as jessica simpson lindsay lohan the tom cruise katie holmes joke and the most overrated overhyped people of all time brad pitt and angelina jolie on the cover and not get tired of it \? it 's nice to know what 's going on with certain celebrities once in a while but every single week \? can you say overkill \? i'm glad i never got a subscription to this magazine i picked it up every once in a while on the newsstand but stopped because i was so sick and tired of reading about overrated overhyped and glorified b movie actors and actresses who were lucky to be in one successful movie and have n't done anything of value since i picked up a copy today and have sworn it off forever do n't waste your time or your money donna di giacom	20

1	business 2 0 is one of the few business magazines i read on a monthly basis and just recently extended for another 2 years one of the most valuable aspects of this magazine is their analysis of the bleeding edge companies i do n't want to limit my reading to case studies and best practices from the biggest most obviously successful companies i want to know what the startups are doing and what the oddball companies with new ideas are doing differently not everything is going to apply but since your own business must constantly evolve i like a magazine that focuses on the constant changes of a variety of businesses why four stars \? to be honest when the magazine was purchased by its current parent company a couple years back i feel the quality took a bit of a hit i do n't care for the new design though i'm sure it saved a few dollars and the number quality of articles also slid a bit but all in all its still one of the better business magazines out there and by far the best in the new economy sector	20
1	i love these luvs ! they are remarkably thin easy to pull out of the wipe warmer yet still very durable and pliable however they are also remarkably difficult to find locally so buy in bulk when you can find them	20
1	this is a very nice piece i 've been looking for a key pendant for a while now but all the ones i 've seen have been very feminine and this one while slightly satanic fits nicely to the meaning i wanted without making me feel like a fairy princess shipping even got here early ! my only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller 4 5	20
1	we bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since we just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way and she just would n't part with it my husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night \( almost 22 months old \) i was so disappointed to see that fisher price does n't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby but the prices people are asking here are outrageous	20
1	this lens hood designed specificaly for the coolpix 5700 is a must have accessory it does more than just protecting the lens which it certainly does esp for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid \( do n't forget murphy 's law \) but the lens hood can also improve your picture quality as with slr lenses the hood prevents light from entering the camera lens from the sides and enhances the sharpness and contrast of the picture this is especially true outdoors when the light is diffused \( scattered \) just use this all the time \( see exception below \) and your pictures out of the 5700 will be at their best \( all other factors being equal of course \) the only times you should not use the hood is when you use the built in flash on the 5700 esp indoors when the flash is used as the main lighting source the hood will block the flash and cast an ugly shadow on your nearby subject even outdoors when you use the built in flash for fill in light you should remove the hood first to avoid uneven exposure get the hood today to improve your pictures and protect your camera	20
1	the robe is very warm and heavy perfect for cold mornings and the just out of the shower chills that you get it doesnt quite have the luxurious feel of a spa robe and the thread loops are matted in certain areas but quality wise it is better than anything else i 've seen for similar prices the length is much shorter than pictured i bought this for my boyfriend who is 6 ft 190 lbs average build and it comes just above his knee ! all in all it 's a decent robe for the price and he likes it	20
1	i first saw this webundies outfit when my friend sara brought them to our lingerie party and i have to admit with all the other hot looking stuff there i did n't have too much hope for these well was i ever wrong you do n't need to be skimpy and revealing to be attractive to your man these will do the trick if your guy has n't been paying you the kind of attention you 've been wanting get a pair of these wear them to bed like pjs climb under the covers roll over pretend to go to sleep i'm betting he wo n't let ya	20
1	these 10 minute workout combos are great for any busy mom since you can do one two or three depending on how much time you have and how tired you are !	20
1	after reading tons of reviews on various mosquito trap technologies i was skeptical that this one was any different since the price was only around 90 i figured it was the cheapest 'gamble' out there so i bought it and put it in my backyard which has been pretty much unusable since june due to the aggressive mosquito population sure enough i have emptied hundreds of mosquitos out of the drawer in the 3 weeks i have had it installed my highest total in a day was 50 my lowest total in a day was 3 when i decided to add an octenol bait to this trap which acted as a repellant as far as i can tell this trap definitely works better in the dark when the little blue lights show up better there are still mosquitos in my backyard and i still get bit i think mosquito conditions are so bad that even after catching hundreds of them it has n't had a significant positive effect yet one word of advice i would like to give place this trap away from any area you want to use i moved it from the yard to my deck for a brief time and it was a bad idea all the mosquitos from the yard were on my deck suddenly yikes ! we are nearing the end of mosquito season in atlanta as cool fall temperatures arrive so it will be hard to judge what effect removing a few hundred mosquitos will have i am anxious to see how the mosquito catcher works next summer during the height of the mosquito frenzy anyway if you 've been wanting something to catch mosquitos with but have been afraid of the prices this is a product that can have positive results without breaking the bank	20
1	i bought this on somewhat of a whim because i 've been wanting get a little more in shape \( got a little bit of pudge going on \) and i realized the hardest part of motivating myself to work out was actually getting ready and going out to the gym time was somewhat of a factor as well so i ordered this a few days ago because i read some reviews on here and it looked like the price was right set it up earlier today the quality of the parts is basically no worse or better than i 'd expected think of it as a stripped down eliptical machine setting it up was fairly easy but some of the instructions were a bit unclear threw on some running sneakers and got on and i 've got to say the feel motion of this thing is really strange at first unless you are a ballet dancer or gymnist with really good balance be prepared to look like an idiot on this thing for a little while because like it 's name it is completely freestyle it 's range of motion and rhythm is all up to you have you ever been on a ski lift at a mountain and had the urge to swing your skis forward and back in unison just because it gives you that tiny feeling of being thrown off balance \? you might start unintentionally doing that for a few minutes on this thing \( it 's actually kind of fun but of course there 's not much of a workout factor doing it \) after about 10 minutes i started to get the motion down it was pretty fun once i got the hang of it but i agree with other reviews it does make your feet sore might try putting some foam on the footplates	20
1	it is a good watch under 200 price range if you buy it you will love it forever one thing i hate is little bit heavy but not a big deal \)	20

0	this was a waste of money my 5 year old loves taking photos she uses my digital camera sometimes i thought this would be a great gift for her she could see the photos on the back of the camera like mom 's this was not the case the lcd does not project the images and it is so small you can not read what mode you are in if the batteries run out it erases the photos i think they should have made it and the directions kid friendly my daughter was frustrated quickly and it has laid in the drawer for 3 months if your child likes to take photos i would invest in something else	20
1	although many reviewers did n't like the second part of the hills i still would n't call it one of the worst sequels ever or the worst wes craven film certainly this is not a masterpiece even in the framework of horror genre but i do n't see why it should be worse than any other slasher flick when i was watching it i came to a conclusion early wes craven had been imitating other directors rather often i'm not saying he was not original at all eventually he shot a nightmare on elm street in 1984 but the hills have eyes were reminiscent of texas chainsaw massacre and in the beginning of 80s when slasher era started i guess craven decided to make something in the same manner maybe the reason was craven 's long time buddy sean cunningham created friday the 13th in 1980 and wes was envious \? \) anyway the second part of the hills have eyes turned out to be a pure slasher like many others at that time and it obviously was n't the worst and in many ways was like above mentioned friday the 13th the score was written by harry manfredini known to every friday fan and the music in hills 2 is just like in early fridays the body count increased comparing to the first part and approached a regular slasher movie kevin blair who had a leading male part here would star in friday the 13th part vii a couple of years later along with kane hodder who did stunts for the hills have eyes 2 and in friday would play you know whom of course here we can see some stupidities as in other slasher movies \( like characters wandering in night all alone instead of sticking together all the big strong guys get killed and a handicapped girl survives i'm not even considering it as a spoiler for it is obvious from the very beginning especially if you 've seen a couple of horror films in your life \) but is that a problem for a true horror fan \? we 've learned not to take this trivia into account so i think the hills have eyes 2 managed on many levels and it would be interesting to have it in your collection if you have the first one for they are two totally different films talking about the subgenres of horror	20

0	even though i think this is a very good idea \( no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand alone potty \) the ring does n't fit our toilet seats well we have the oblong seats not the round ones and the ring slides back and forth especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it it does n't make her feel very stable so so far at least she has refused to use it	20

0	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested the etch tore when examing the inside of the printer i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage the next new cartridge would not work either wasted tech support said to have the printer repaired ya sure \( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out \) printer repair would cost me more a new one	20
1	read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child 's nusery i absolutely love it before this my son could not sleep well with our family 's humiifier because it was too noisy within an hour of bringing this home it was set up \( very easily \) and he took one of many 2 1 2 hour naps that week ! no filters no noise no problems thus far ! i did have it on high for the first 20 mins and found a puddle of water underneath but the humidifier was near a window and i am asumming there was a draft that may have directed the steam toward the dresser top \( the problem was resolved once moved unto a different surfacetop \) filling it is a snap and the very fine mist \( looked like small stream of fog \) was a pleasure to see out of the trunk of the animal ! the tank seems to last longer than the box states it is on it 's third day on a low med setting and it still only has a 3 inch difference at the top i love the safety features and i do n't have to worry about the tank still on if it 's empty since it has an automatic shut off ! the light is not a problem since he likes to have a tiny bit of light in his room it is a design that will last thoughout his childhood ! thank you crane !	20
1	as a dentist of over 20 years experience i have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one 's teeth the unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities \( especially in kids \) and inevitable gum disease in adults which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss gum disease almost always starts in between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in between stubborn plaque below the gumline the bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime i have heard all the excuses for not flossing the floss is too hard to handle my fingers turn blue my fingers are too fat i'm too clumsy the floss hurts my gums etc etc this disposable flosser is great for kids who may not have the dexterity to load a non disposable flosser such as the flossaide dental floss holder which i recommend for adults \( see my review \) i have recommended this floss aid to my young patients over the years and i strongly recommend it to you as well one still has to develop the habit of flossing daily and this device aides in the mechanics of flossing making it a breeze get it and save your teeth ! jim konedog koeni	20

0	i work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke with the money that you pay for a filter and 5 qts of oil you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up will this company stand by its product like that \? i doubt it for a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you 're worried about gunk it 's a scam	20

0	please careful about this grooming kit i bought one week before and when i turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work this product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not this lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair also this can not be used for continuous use if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge	20

0	i installed this software after getting it free after rebates and i must say i am not the least bit impressed it claims to speed up your system but instead only slows it down seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer but it 's relatively new and has a gig of memory as another reviewer mentioned my internet stopped working correctly \( although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet ! \) and my system restore just would n't work it deleted a lot of entries i needed to run my system correctly the anti spyware was an absolute joke the updates were large files almost every day 8 mb a day practically on a lighter note fix it utilities found a virus other programs were unable to find i use zone alarm security suite and then use ccleaner to take care of the rest i think they 're the best combination no program beats zone alarm 's fast secure and wo n't bug down your computer i had to reinstall my operating system thanks to fix it utilities	20

0	after souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums \( a feat achieved by only a handful of bands \) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc the bunnymen built their reputation on moody psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in ocean rain for this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory eschewing album wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned if you 're new to the bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums \( crocodiles heaven up here porcupine and ocean rain \) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts evergreen and flowers	20
1	in a nutshell what do you do when it's raining your tire goes flat in wal mart's parking lot \? this happened to me today and i was scared out of my wits i had an hour to get home before my six year old son got off the school bus i was 25 miles away and i just saw my rear tire and knew it had no air in it i recalled using this product about 6 years ago and that it worked so i ran into wal mart and skipped the items i had come shopping for and went straight to the automotive section to hunt for this stuff twenty minutes later standing in the parking lot i read the directions and realized that i had to try to find what was leaking and remove it if possible after breaking a small screwdriver and bending a key for a car we sold 5 years ago i managed to remove a nail that was about 4 inches long the trouble was that the rest of the air leaked out rather quickly once i pulled out the nail read and follow the directions ! the directions on the can stated that the valve stem had to be in the 8 o'clock position so i had my teenage daughter back the car up until the valve stem was at the 8 o'clock position i shook the can for over 30 seconds as angela timed me then i screwed the hose attachment into the valve stem it whooshed as a stream of white foamy liquid rushed through the transparent tubing into the tire i could hear air rushing in with it but then i recalled what had actually happened the last time i used this stuff about 6 years ago you guessed it the hole was towards the top of the tire and the foam never got there allowing the air to simply escape very nosily out the hole since the flat was in the rear of my front drive plymouth voyager minivan i drove it to a gas station that i knew had air about 6 miles away i went about 25 mph and many people hailed me as they drove alongside to inform me that i had a flat tire but then something good happenedby the time i reached the chevron station with the air still some 20 miles from our home i was convinced that i had turned the flat tire into spaghetti and that we would miss the bus well i am happy to report that this was not the case from traveling slowly the tire had circulated that white sealant foam and had heated up some due to the extra friction caused by running without air i filled the tire up and to my surprise there was no sound of escaping air the sealant held and i drove at a somewhat reduced speed the remaining 18 20 miles in about 38 minutes to get home about 2 minutes ahead of the bus bottom line have an air source nearby if you pull out the nailthis stuff does work but after you pull out a nail from your tire it may be rather difficult to get it to hold the air before it can circulate and heat up within the tire this was my actual experience with this exact product today and it is consistent with what happened 6 years ago in short have an air supply lined up when you insert the sealant as close as possible to where you remove the nail and insert the sealant this will reduce the risk of running the tire flat and rendering it unserviceable if you do this you stand an excellent chance of executing a fast emergency repair that anybody can manage and like me you too might save the day i am not affiliated with any product or company	20
0	i'm not going to go into my childhood or how i love the transformers or any of that stuff i just wanted to give a quick review as always you get what you pay for i bought this today and within five minutes of transforming it one of the joints popped out and i ca n't for the life of me get it to sit correctly back in the socket bottom line is that it is very cool that ten dollars will get you a g1 inspired astrorain or starscream but be aware these feel very flimsy and are definately better utilized sitting on your desk at work in robot mode than being transformed back and forth while you are bored watching tv very cool very flimsy very inexpensive	20
0	i quesss for the price you cant beat it but i think it should have said patch leather or leather pieces also the size runs larger than regular coats xl was really more like an xxl but like i said for the price you cant beat it i really should have invested more and got a better coat thank you dlan	20

0	i was very excited to see this frame and thought that would be a perfect gift for a fellow geek i was extremely disappointed to see poor the picture quality it looked like the photos were taken using one of the first generation digital cameras that came on the market some 10 years ago the resolution was similar to my first palm pilot \( iiix \) just enlarged i sent it back after trying to get it to display pictures where you could actually see peoples faces i believe that the pictures of this device showing colorful and detailed images were doctored or transposed to make this product look better	20
1	fits nicely onto the kensington power block the fit is snug and secure enough not to fall off and get lost	20
0	there are so many different sites that all tell you that 'they' have the best absorbed coenzyme q10 manufactured it 's hard to know who is really telling the absolute truth or just propagandizing a product for quick sale we are born with extremely high levels of coenzyme q10 and then it gets slowly used up as the years pass even if we actually eat the foods that resupply our bodies and who purposefully eats these foods for the coenzyme q10 content \? the mitochondria in every single cell in our body needs this coenzyme for production of energy by the time we are over 40 our levels have dropped significantly and our energy levels have dropped with it i must admit that this nature 's made product does not seem to increase my energy level like other company 's coenzyme q10 does so from my own reaction to this product i do not recommend this particular coenzyme q10 there are several other companies that make excellent effective products \( like dr whitaker 's and dr sinatra 's and dr william 's \) but not this nature made product	20

1	this is the jacksons second album for epic and producers gamble and huff it would be their last with gamble and huff but together they made a great album that doesnt get the play it should music 's takin over different kind of lady and do what you wanna are great catchy dance tracks the real greatness here lies in the ballads where michael 's voice is in peak form even though you 're gone and find me a girl are classic ballads so good i feel that find me a girl is probably the best michael jackson song you 've never heard this is probably michael jackson 's most overlooked album and its one of his best ! the jacksons all sing together great and you can see why destiny and triumph were such big hits after this one was recorded overall great ballads catchy feel good dance tracks and michael jackson singing his heart out get this you will not be dissaponted	20
0	i liked the first two spy kids movies pretty well the first one was well done and the acting great the second one was maybe a bit less than the first but still entertaining this movie however was incredibly lame and absolutely boring my brother went to see it with my mom in theaters and for some reason they came back saying it was soooo good when it came out on dvd i watched it with my brother only twenty minutes into it i was wishing i could leave all the amazing 3 d computer animated sequences were giving me terriblel headaches and i no reason whatsoever to watch this drivel as a previous reviewer said the spy kids series lost its charm after the second installment in this movie they were trying to go out with a bang but fell miles short of the finish line the acting seemed stale and unemotional the humor was lame and not even funny and the whole things seemed like a weird dream the director thought might make a decent movie overall it seems to me that this was just one mega test for the even worse flop the adventures of sharkboy and lavagirl i have no appreciation for this director any more and unless he gives us something good fast i probably wo n't be watching anymore of his films any time soon	20
1	great portability good picture for the price i like the fact that i can plug this player into any tv and play dvd 's and also take it in the car camping or anywhere i also purchased a small set of external speakers which will really improve the sound onboard speakers a little lacking but overall a great value	20
1	so this controller looked pretty sweet to me so i bought it over a rumble pad i liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat as i tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers i bought this controller specifically for star wars battlefront 2 on pc and it works like a dream i also like the x box controller layout \( offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic \) than the ps2 style controller that is the logitech rumble pad it also has better grips than a ps2 controller the only things i think are bad about it are the following 1 it is not modeled on the large xbox controller but rather the regular one which is ok for most people but i have big hands and i get a bit cramped up if i play for way too long 2 i was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad i have a saitek cyborg evo joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game this is n't an issue with battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator but i could see where if a game did n't have as good an interface \( or maybe older games \) this pad could suffer in this regard 3 this is n't so much an issue for me but i would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out i do n't care too much because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything i will still use it even if it does die overall a great controller i actually would give it a 4 5 rating but that is n't an option here	20

0	i bought this item as a gift and it ended up becoming mine i have to say i am greatly dissatisfied here are some main issues i am having with the camera 1 it is very poorly designed the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant buttons are really ugly and operating the camera is awkward and for some functions requires both hands to operate 2 the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally 3 the worst by far is the picture quality colors are just plain terrible automatic settings are a disaster of photography i have used a canon \( 2mp \) before getting this one \( 5mp \) the canon was far superior in quality colors lighting i do n't need large files of trash i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures as a result i am strongly recommending getting a different camera i have had great experiences with canon and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too but hp must stop making cameras and indeed many other devices	20

0	what an incredible waste of acting talent there was a crooked man turned out to be director joseph mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as all about eve and the barefoot contessa should be embarrassed by this bomb kirk douglas plays paris pittman jr a charming persuasive prisoner incarcerated in territorial prison for ten years for an armed robbery that netted him 500 000 he hid the loot prior to his capture it 's presence is common knowledge among the inmates giving him celebrity status newly appointed warden woodrow lopeman played by henry fonda is trying to use douglas' influence to coax the inmates help him initiate prison reform under the guise of playing along with fonda douglas secretly plots his escape to be reunited with his ill gotten cash with an excellent cast including hume cronyn burgess meredith and lee grant i expected a whole lot more than this disappointing flick delivered	20

0	i purchased this item two weeks ago my thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced perfect addition to the tools necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby \( its advertised contents construction and glow in the dark planisphere \) after closely examining the item for the past ten days i'm forced to conclude that i was in error and that you really do get what you pay for as celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy i must confess that i assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name i have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps the major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings letter transpositions apparent omitted words and just plain \( what we used to call in the old days \) typographical errors additionally when i compare some of the technical information on the maps \( i e star magnitudes astronomical distances etc \) and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources i have in my possession i also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances when using a product like this it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains since i'm not able to do this i must rate this item with one star when i purchased the item it was marked down by twenty percent i note that in less that two weeks since my purchase the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent in this case do n't be fooled \( as i was \) by an attractive price avoid this product \( i do n't have a substitute to recommend at this time \)	20
0	i have two ni mh chargers and sony batteries wo n't charge in them they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers they force you to buy their own non standard charger that probably wo n't again charge other brand batteries and of course this is not mentioned anywhere no wonder these batteries are the cheapest do n't waste your money or support sony 's attempt to bring non standard products into a standardized market soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough	20
0	i ordered one of these a couple months ago to have as a second charger at work since my i830 has such a small battery life after about 1 2 months of use the thing shorted out and would n't work any more i decided to get another one because it was cheap and figured i 'd give it another chance the thing did n't even work out of the box this time i only wish i could give it zero stars spend the money on a motorola brand charger instead	20
1	i just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs my first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs however gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative we considered this model and the evenflo top of stair gate after inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking if one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit also why take the chance with safety \? anyway here are a few things to consider when installing this item 1 i took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only this is a must do it would be a wall damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall 2 unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and do n't want to damage them by having screws go all the way through use longer screws than the dinky 1 4 to 1 2 screws that are provided in the kit i went with 2 screws for additional strength 3 \) installation is n't that big of a deal just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls i found the picture based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word based instructions at the front of the booklet it was n't a five minute job but it was not hard at all i 'll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our 11 months old son and our 100lb dog	20
1	at first i thought the only reason why i wanted this cd was because idina menzel was on it but now after listening to the whole cd i was right idina menzel was amazing and all of the other cast members are incredibly talented too i would highly recommend this because it is a very interesting story it 's incredibly complex music \( theoretically \) but at the same time it is very enjoyable ! ! ! ! i would give it more stars if i could but i am only allowed 5 \(	20
0	i wish i had read some of the reviews for this product before i bought it i was so disappointed with the quality of the product the sheets are extremely rough thin and scratchy the comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one since thomas the tank engine is such a popular character i would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing it 's trademark as such i am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding	20
0	i wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy i will say our child is a bright out going 8 month old now but in the beginning she was colicky and a terrible napper ! i thought this was a brilliant idea but began to realize that many of the bright gifted children i know did n't have exposure to this system it is loud to wear and not so comfortable you are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening good luck if you choose to purchase but just think einstein was fine with out one	20
1	as soon as i walked out of the theater i declared that i had to own a copy of this movie i had to wait a long time for it to be released to dvd \( it was in theaters in late winter but they did n't put it to dvd till almost a year later probably hoping to capitalize on awards' season reviews and recommendations \) it was well worth the wait it is a shame that this film was overlooked with the awards i think that the timing of the release factored in but maybe it just appeals to some people \( like me \) more than others the entire ensemble does a great job i just rewatched it and i still enjoy it after at least 6 viewings it would make a wonderful addition to your video collection especially if you are a michael douglas fan \( and having a pittsburgh connection helps too the movie really captured a lot of the essence of pittsburgh even with the weather when there is snow on the ground the sun is peeking through and it is raining all at the same time ! \) it is just a good movie all around and should appeal to viewers who enjoy smart films there are just truly funny scenes and some really touching parts what a wild journey these characters find themselves on over the span of just one weekend i think the best part is that it is n't non stop action and things do n't get so out of the realm of possibility it still retains a good touch of believability even as some pretty unbelievable things happen pick up the soundtrack while you are at it bob dylan 's things have changed is great \( and it recieved an oscar \) it is mostly a cd to just kick back and relax to	20
0	the swing was easy to install and i did not need extra tools or help unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal it was even enough however and i put my daughter in the swing was tilting a little far forward but i could not adjust it the worst part was getting her out the tray was near impossible to undo from its locked position i guess i did not need to worry about her falling out i was just wondering if i would be able to get her out at all i 'll be donating the swing	20

1	speaking as someone who has to watch her carb intake carefully i was not keen on trying yet another item that claimed to be low carb and good tasting so often the two do not go together especially when dealing with the traditional more carby foods such as pasta bread rice etc dreamfields is a happy exception this is not to say you can cook up a whole box and eat it all at once \( those who have to watch carb intake will still need to do some portion control \) but you can actually have a large scoop of delicious hot pasta alone or in your culinary creations and not blow your carb allowance and this is not some flimsy dissolving cardboard tasting pasta it cooks up hearty and substantial when you eat it it fills up that i am so hungry for carbs i could eat a ton of potatoes need satisfying delicious filling and easier on the insulin levels than regular pasta i love it !	20

0	when putting together the mobile section of this item i was very disappointed in its flimsiness it looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic when i turned it on i was disappointed a second time this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates it 's so loud you ca n't hear the music which is a shame because i'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights the third disappointment the buttons are very hit and miss sometimes the music buttons do n't work \( the lullaby one worked eventually once i mashed it in really hard \) that i could live with but it 's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating control for music off lights on off and rotation on off all seem to be tied up in two buttons if you have the music and lights going then turn on the rotation the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them please bear in mind i am not particularly daft i managed to figure out my tivo remote in a day or so but the controls for this baby 's musical mobile make no sense to me i thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby 's natural curiosity' but after two nights it really got on my nerves and if i ca n't figure it out i do n't see how my one year old is supposed to i can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there i'm not dismissing this item all together the music is lovely not too simplified and not too electronic sounding the minute waltz is particularly nice \( i 've noticed my son scans for it \) the lights are lovely too and do look pretty when they 're moving if you can stand the buzzing my son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep but if you buy it i 'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it	20
1	i bought this for christmas for my three children ages 4 \( twins \) and 18 mos although the younger child does n't really get the games we play with it the older ones do and we all have a great time my goal was to get them to be active during the winter \( less tv time \) and this works for about 30 minutes i only wish we had a bigger house so i could have gotten the bigger parachute i ca n't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm	20

0	after reading all the author 's books so far i realized he is repeating himself in all his books \( including the ones which myron bolitar is n't present \) there are the same elements in the plot disappeared person who might or not be dead mobster guys who might or not be involved in the plot the hero gets beaten by mosbter guys and is always saved in the last minute someone wealthy and with lots has interest in the plot but no one knows for sure as the plots became being built upon the same structure the suprise is getting less and less after each book being someone who started liking mistery books after reading all agatha christie 's ones and because each book of hers is completely diferent from the other i look for the same originality in other mistery books of course the book is good for a first time harlan coben reader i just did n't like it that much because of the repetitions which make very easy to guess the final spoiling the suspense of the reading	20

0	after 350 miles of moderate usage \( 6 5mph average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily \) a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms rendering the trainer inoperable unfortunately this was considered a wear item and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used very lightly \( perhaps 20 miles max \) during the first year of purchase \( warranty period \) i put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and while it was great for burning calories i never really felt that it was a quality piece of equipment it appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these wear items thus making repair expensive and difficult this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non moving load bearing support piece seems a little fishy to me throughout the life of the machine i was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use after about 70 miles i noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface i believe this was also partly due to too much play in the interaction of the wheels and tracks allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution this machine does not feel very sturdy and throughout the last month of its very short life gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever i used it somehow i knew it was about to break and unfortunately it did my hunch was real enough that i began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago please shop around i would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine 's mechanical components if you are an infrequent user this model may be ok but if you plan on using it every day i would recommend that you keep on looking note that my machine was a 428p which at the time of purchase differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring the frame is identical in the 418 and 428p which appears to be no longer sold since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction they are appropriate for a review of the 418 unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems i experienced are likely to still occur visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction	20

1	i just received the blackburn delphi 6 0 earlier this week and i 've already put it through a few rides i'm upgrading from a cateye astrale 8 that i 've had for a long time i 've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately and i thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great i almost bought the delphi 5 0 a while ago but decided to hold out for the 6 0 to get the nifty altimeter features here are my impressions about my new computer good and bad pros the mounting bracket system is very clever and seems better that the cateye bracket i was used to changeble soft platic shims line the bracket clamp changing the fit for different handlebar diameters 3 different thicknesses are included which chould accomodate everything from skinny aerobar computer mounts to oversized road handlebars the altimeter function is great the altitude measurement is solid and seems very accurate the percent grade reading acts sensibly even though it lags a little \( this is explained in the manual \) the distance climbed at the end of a ride agrees very well with topographic software and works far better than the gps based solution i had been using the lap feature is great for capturing statistical snapshots of particular segments of your ride had a big hill on your route and want to know how much you climbed and how fast you averaged up the grade \? the delphi makes it really easy to see those sections taken out of the whole up to 20 laps can be recorded i think of them less as laps and more as intervals the backlight feature is very cool i 've always just done without computer info at night before but this way i do n't have to i'm sure it kills batteries but it 's nice to have cons the average speed algorithm seems a little flaky it seems to read ay least 0 1 mph slower than one would get by simply dividing distance by ride time my cateye always agreed well with the calculated value but the way the delphi is figuring the average must be different this is liveable and seems to be less of a problem on routes without a lot of stopping the max heart rate reading can get ruined by frequent spikes so that the real max hr is unknown finishing a ride it 's possible that the max hr will show something unrealistic like 235 probably due to a signal glitch or some interference then you have no way of knowing what the true value is these spikes do n't affect the average however i should mention that i 've seen this behavior on both of the standalone hrms i 've had before so it 's not unique to the delphi the cadendce sensor was hard to mount so that the magnet was close enough to the sensor i had to put the magnet very close to the end of the crank because the crank arm is close enough to the chainstay at that point but mounted there the magnet covers the back side of the pedal spindle if you have pedals which require a hexkey from the back side to remove that could be a problem they could have remedied that by making the cadence magnet a little thicker for comparison my cateye crank magnet was mounted in the middle of the arm with no problem the wire from the cadence enabled bracket to the cadence sensor is very long this may be good for putting it out on aerobars or something and i admit that too long is better than too short but i have a foot or more of extra cable to try to hide around my shifter cable housings and it 's hard to tuck that slack away and i have a large bike frame with plenty of tube real estate to spare unlike my standalone hrms the delphi does n't calculate calories used not that those numbers are ever accurate anyway but it would be nice for ride to ride comparison general thoughtsoverall i think it 's a great computer the negatives above all are really minor issues and i have n't found a computer yet that offers as much for such a reasonable price there 's a lot more to tell than i can include in a review like this i'm just trying to hit the big highlights \( and lowlights \) but definitely no regrets on this end for buying it	20
1	the great locomotive chase is the stuff of legend this somewhat obscure event which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on fort sumter could too easily be written off among civil war devotees as a lark a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from shiloh to the seven days to second manassas to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union but first time author russell bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms telling it well and placing it in its proper context the raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue espionage and derring do and if mr bonds had only told the tale itself this book would be well worth the read but what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much civil war writing is mr bonds 's ability to tell this gripping tale objectively while putting it in its proper context the author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after first manassas and by doing so and by explaining why the raid coupled with the deep penetration of general ormsby mitchell into tennessee and north alabama offered the fleeting chance to cut the confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war mr bonds gives the otherwise reckless lan of the raiders its proper place andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark even though students of the era will have the natural reaction what were they thinking \? mr bonds answers that question and the answer as incongruous as it may seem reminds the reader that there was so much more to the great war than the epic battles of the armies of the potomac and northern virginia if the author had done nothing more than told the story of the great raid reconciling contemporary accounts that were so often embellished this would be a wonderful adventure story in the great tradition of shelby foote 's narrative history of the war but this book does so much more it puts the raid in its proper strategic context and it tells the story of the gallant raiders after the raid itself failed this book will satisfy both the devoted civil war critic and the general reader who loves a historical tale well told	20

0	first of all ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like all the others ike took advantage of her tina her self said she cared very much for him cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on so she released her autobiography in 1986 well after her come back in 1984 while ike can try to deny it all he wants the truth is he violently abused tina ! and considering the person ike turner is i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic excusse of a come back ! !	20

1	do n't get me wrong i'm as likely as anyone else looking for a chick flick to watch the latest meg ryan movie with the cute leading man but this movie adds something extra instead of just dishing out the same old blather that most romantic comedies spout \( girl guy meet girl guy go through some conflict but eventually guy girl get together and live happily ever after \) this movie actually takes the time to explore what makes a relationship between two people special and unique whether that relationship is between two friends lovers or family members this movie is also great because it expounds upon the huge role that a person 's mind plays when it comes to love and sex kate capshaw 's character helen is great for audience members who still have n't figured out that women are sexual beings and that it 's okay for them to enjoy sex ! \( even with a much younger man ! \) all the characters remind us that even though we may not have everything figured out you can always learn some new tricks no matter what your age if you 're in the mood for mindless entertainment i would n't recommend this movie however if you 're ready for a touching and romantic but still lighthearted flick this is a good one !	20

0	this high chair was great to start but after a while the tray table would come loose on one side during meals i thought it was me at first not latching it correctly but we soon realized it was my 9 month old releasing the clasp reluctant to change chairs we persevered and now 3 months later she can remove both sides entirely and send the tray and its contents crashing to the floor i am worried that she will either trap her fingers as the tray comes loose or bruise her legs as the tray falls to the ground if you are looking for a chair to last you into toddler hood and your child learns quickly do n't buy this one i am looking for a replacement before my daughter hurts herself	20

1	office 2007 is a nice step up from office 2003 \( and earlier \) as it has better visuals on the toolbar e g instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands i e file tools edit etc you 'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar when clicking on the tabs it sets up across the toolbar all of the functions of that particular tab once viewed you not only see the words of the functions but also small example graphs and images of what that functions does this only applies to all the applications other than outlook which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003the load times seem to be much quicker than what i had in the 2003 version in outlook setting up accounts maintaining names and addresses is much easier too the only annoying part of office 2007 that comes to mind is one can only choose from 3 color schemes the three are black which really looks more like a dark taupe or slate color blue which looks more like a light powder blue and silver which looks like a light gray in my honest opinion i like having the standard color look like previous versions and as my taste goes with this i only like the black setup only	20
0	i wish i could give this movie zero stars it 's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore violence and sick humour into a movie and try to pass it off as slick comedy drama and deep philosophy this movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie the sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism do yourself a favour and please do n't ever watch this movie if it comes on air it 's not even worth watching for morbid fascination i terribly resent the fact that i gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity but then i may actually be glad that i did at least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be	20
0	omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes \( often occuring at the end of a lengthy process \) nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want 9 95 for an email question or 19 95 for a phone question you might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of omnipage you would expect some support i recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support	20

1	this was the first scary movie i ever saw in the cinema and it made a strong impression on me the bathtub scenes were so eerie that i only took showers for a few years after i saw this movie at 15 that is how much it scared me i have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective although i do have to say it is pretty scary and well done watching it many years later i was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era the carpet and some of the clothes were funny but it did n't detract from the film glad i bought it	20

1	the pang of lost chances and the breakup of friendships made during shared experiences whether it be high school college or any specific period of life everytime i see fandango the experience and emotions of finishing college and leaving friends made during that time hits me all over again as other reviewers have noted the soundtrack is especially masterful \( the use of pat metheny during the wedding sequence is a particular favorite	20
0	the door in the floor is difficult to like even \( or perhaps especially \) if you 're a fan of john irving 's book a widow for one year which was the source of this film the movie is dark depressing slow moving it also showcases the least likable characters from the book to make matters worse it focuses only on the first third of the novel 's story which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated \( alienating \) couple 's suffering the film is completely devoid of the novel 's interesting more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family 's life into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who are n't well developed in the film but who are central to the book 's satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story ! this may give you an idea why the film was n't very successful with audiences the theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people unfortunately the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents played by jeff bridges kim basinger in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons it wallows in the empty chasm that 's grown between them delves into the sad meaningless even cruel love affairs they each engage in in vain attempts to ease their sorrows escape the pain of the love lost between them of course the greatest loss the loss of their sons the film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose and finally we witness the pain of their very young daughter who was born out of yet more of the parent 's attempts to fill their empty sad lives and we 're treated to a view of her pitiful childhood growing up with parents who truly are n't there the greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel and even worse why they chose to bring to life only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it ! if the theme of loss is one you 're very interested in you might find this movie quite affecting as for me a great fan of the book i can only hope that someday someone makes a better more complete adaptation of this great book it 's not nearly as desperate sad a story as this film version ! on subsequent viewings i 've grown to appreciate this film a bit more taken completely apart from the novel it 's not a bad film undoubtedly the performances are wonderful however little fun they are to watch	20

1	earl grey is my favorite blend of tea by far no competition there the biggest secret with this tea once given to earl grey of hoswick hall \( british prime minister in 1830 1834 \) by a chinese manadarin reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil a rather intense tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange \( which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange the latter is native to south vietnam and its oil was probably the recipe 's original ingredient \) using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea 's natural flavor but with twinings you just ca n't go wrong because the original earl grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his chinese friend \( from the twinings website when the mandarin 's tasty gift began to run out earl grey asked his tea merchants twinings to match it for him twinings unique blend was the grey family 's long standing favourite when guests inquired about it they were directed to twinings on the strand where they would ask for earl grey 's tea by name \) unless you insist on having all your tea with cream or milk i recommend having this one without any kind of milk products not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition in my mind it just plain ruins the blend 's particular flavor \( but that 's just me of course \) whichever way you have it though if scented teas are your kind of thing twinings earl grey should be right up your alley	20

0	whether you 're planning to read through crowley 's book of thoth for the first time or if you think you know every little thing crowley was getting at with it this book is going to be equally useless to you several of crowley 's diagrams from the book of thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly but sadly that 's the only good thing about this book the book is filled with a lot of fluff duquette tells many useless anecdotes of crowley 's and harris' lives and constantly excuses and defends crowley 's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found crowley 's works so perhaps its some sort of atonement but the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with crowley 's character through out the book of thoth crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid unfortunately duquette does n't do this his background information is base and scarce he does spend some time explaining about thelema and kabbalah but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this duquette does n't give nearly enough information to understand crowley 's works and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere as for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on crowley 's work duquette outright fails at times it seems as if duquette does n't even understand crowley or the book of thoth and the associated tarot deck i do n't think the man even understands tarot in general \( and duquette 's own tarot deck is evidence of this too \) at his best duquette only manages to rephrase what crowley had to say in the book of thoth typically though a lot of what crowley was getting at is complete lost in duquette 's work a lot of it no doubt because duquette never really understood crowley at anything but a very base level reading through the book of thoth there are a few ways in which duquette could have made his book better crowley 's phonetic translation of the i ching does n't follow the current standard and sometimes the differences are confusing especially if the reader is not already familiar with the i ching a key showing crowley 's translation and the standard translation would 've been helpful likewise crowley rarely wrote on astrology despite astrology being alluded to many times through the book of thoth and what he did write is hard to find a chapter explaining crowley 's views on astrology would 've been great if that was n't possible then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what crowley was working with would have been helpful however duquette 's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read duquette 's book is n't useful as a reference to crowley 's work duquette does n't seem to understand crowley most of the time and fails to adequatley explain crowley 's ideas besides some new agey nonsense like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays duquette does n't offer any new ideas or insights into crowley 's work except for a few nice diagrams \( which are common enough and easy to find \) there is n't anything worthwhile contained in this book at least not anything you wo n't get out of reading crowley 's book of thoth	20

0	this tub was great in the beginning it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all it was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while i was washing her etc however after using the tub about 10 times it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside basically the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled she was n't hurt but was very scared keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs so i do n't think her weight was an issue	20

1	i 've been very pleased with this external drive 500gb my only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it now it seems to always mount its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive the other thing would be that it could use one more firewire 400 port \( there is only one \) i do n't use 800 yet so i need to daisy it off of my smartdisk firelite that happens to have 2 all in all get this drive	20
0	having just read the book \( most highly recommended \) i decided to treat myself to the movie i could have cried while i did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book i was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around in the book the 5 men bonded together and were great men of character in the movie they got rid of one man had the other eaten right off the bat pencroft is shown to be a coward and greedy in the book nemo appears only in the last two or three chapters and he does not have an elaborate home on the island and what about those stupid giant animals \? i do n't recall reading about them the fence around nemo 's home looks like it came right from jurassic park the whole story was about 5 \( eventually 6 \) men who were stranded on an uncharted island and the wonderful adventures they had there on another note the graphics were pretty bad the panning was very blurry and the picture was often grainy as one reviewer well said it is suitable for children who are easily pleased but it is nothing like the book perhaps this is why amazon sells it for only 6 99	20

1	i wanted to mainly write this to address the shipping complaints below we are redoing our deck and expanding it and after research thought this would be the best buy for a durable product after reading the shipping complaints we put it on order right away expecting to have it in the several weeks it would take for the deck lo and behold 3 days later they call my wife and ask to deliver it any 4 hour window she wants she picks the next morning and the next day when i get home there are 4 giant boxes in my garage spot when i get home they are huge boxes and double boxed but luckily no styrofoam still i had to take all the cardboard to the recycling center myself but at least very little was not recycleable our deck is still not done so i can make little comment other than that the one i did set up in the living room seems study the cushion is very thick and well made but stiff which may be the comment noted below \( i assume he goes for very soft \) i find it comfortable but may comment more when we have actually used them a bit still given the shipping concerns noted is several comments i wanted to point out that if you have someone who can be home for a four hour window it seems to be no problem	20

1	i absolutely love the smell of philosophy 's cinnamon buns like the other reviewers have said it does n't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented i only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense i like the other cinnamon buns products also i use the cream and the lip gloss	20

1	i have a manual sharpener but in reality almost never use it the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no brainer there 's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull for most knives the fine and polishing grinder works just great if you have inexpensive knives the coarse grinder will chew them up but if you have well made knives the waring will work well i 've had good success with the waring	20
1	i love it when two of my favorite actors are in a movie together when one 's off screen you have the other to keep you entertained and when they 're on screen together it 's movie making at its best the plot itself leaves a bit to be desired the film 's production was stop and go for so long i heard that the director changed direction before it was finished my guess is that some of what was lost was what was missing from the movie particularly in regards to understanding benicio 's character properly nonetheless tommy lee jones and benicio del toro shine throughout p s being an animal lover i love that two leads in a movie are pro animal too	20
1	this language learning software is the best i have ever tried you can work with the lesson material in several different ways utilizing your favorite method of learning expecially great is the speaking unit which allows you to match your pronunciation with that of the instructor the package is well worth the cost	20
0	after i read stories about problems chlorine causes in the shower chlorine i got this filter it turns out most water systems are using chloramine now a more stable additive instead of chlorine and this filter like most is ineffective at removing chloramine see if your water system uses chloramine and save yourself an expensive filter that probably does n't work	20
0	i received this item today and was surprised1 \) it was shipped from overseas \( uk \) 2 \) it came with only one cd instead of two like a previous reviewer thought3 \) no paperwork it came in a clear case with no artwork info etc4 \) sonic foundry sold acid to sony in 2003 \( according to sonic foundry 's website \) and sf no longer provides support5 \) i ca n't get this to register online which seems a little dodgy but other than that it seems functional no huge library of loops either ca n't really say i got what i expected	20
0	i complete disagree with the previous review on that sonicare is superior i 've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and braun sonic complete is by far the best however this unit is nothing like sonic complete the sonic energy is completely in the handle it 's like holder a vibrator the real sonic complete channels the energy to the brush head you are probably better more with one of the other two models of vitality that uses rotational brush heads	20

0	my only experience with this product was after i opened it and started to play a dvd in my xbox when i tried to pause it it did n't work and it had brand new batteries i found \( after much frustration \) that if i smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes i took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so i just got my money back you can buy a dvd player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	20

1	the off color did n't bother me i expected that after reading all the reviews i agree it could have been about 6 lower to the ground however there was a 3 flaw in the stitching of one seam a bead of duco cement sealed that up and it will never be seen on the back side of the grill the heavy duty material looks like it stand the test of time and weather	20
0	this product was terrible first and foremost this seat did not fit on american airlines business class seats ! secondly the rear facing car seat tilts so far forward that your baby is falling forward agains the harness and if they fall asleep their face is pressing against the seat belt the wheel covers fell off the first time i used it the stroller is a piece of junk when i called the company to explain my problems they never even called me back so on top of it all they have a horrible product and terribel customer service to match do not buy	20

0	recently renewed my subscription after a three year hiatus and i could n't believe my eyes the magazine is a skeleton of its former self with slim stories and little science bob guccione jr 's mag is not even that fun to read on the happier side the magazine appears to shun its earlier environmental preoccupations	20
1	i just received these and popped 'em in and i'm listening to mp3s on my pc at first one of sides was really weak in volume in the process of testing the balance in my software i accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys but that apparently did the trick now both are equal and sound good there is decent bass but the highs are a bit soft a quick tweak to my equalizer and they 're great after reading several of the reviews on amazon i was a bit worried about the sound but now that i have them i'm very happy they 're a good price and sooooo much better than the little ipod like earbuds i 've tried before those never stayed in my ear and the bass never made me happy summary these jbuds stay in my ear have good sound \( not great but i think good for 20 \) and have equal length cords from each ear	20
0	i used phytospecific relaxer on my virgin hair during the summer \( 2006 \) i first thought it to be a great investment \( 60 \) and worth the cost after use i found my hair to be relaxed but not bone straight as i 've experienced with other relaxers which is what i desired my hair is very soft and fine and quite sensitive to chemicals so i was in search of a product that would straighten my hair and not leave any damaging affects after the 2nd treatment \( september 2006 \) i soon found that my hair was experiencing breakage around the temples and severe breakage at the nape of my neck i quit using the product perhaps this product works for some but as mentioned earlier my hair is quite sensitive to chemicals and unfortunately i experienced hair loss ! so it 's back to the drawing \( or growing \) board for me	20
1	i have used quickbooks basic for a number of years both in my church and for my business i have kept qb 2004 basic since the upgrades were not immediately necessary for me i chose to upgrade this year to keep current on maintenance etc so again i chose the most basic product offered simple start i received it just fine and it installed perfectly however it does not upgrade any previous qb files as i investigated intuit says that it wo n't upgrade files from previous qb versions on their web site \( albeit in small print \) and on the product box itself but that was not ever mentioned in the amazon listing so then i had to upgrade to the next higher version an additional 80 qb pro also works very well it 's just a shame that intuit insists on misleading customers by not providing full information through all marketing channels the intuit phone rep also tried to overcharge me 20 for the upgrade but quickly accepted the correct amount when i pointed out their error a second time	20
0	i am a hater to the core i hate puffy and thats all it is to it now there you do n't have to say it so on to the review first off every lyrical line puffy spit in this album was outdone by everybody every track he had the weakest flow and the worst rhymes and thats the truth i do n't know how true this is but i heard loon was behind most of puffy 's lines on this album so that should explain the utter wackness in his lyrics the truth is i do n't care who writes his lines it could be tupac and nas doin it since its not them spittin it then it actually takes away from the rhymes itself almost this entire album is filler the best tracks is real n and journey through my life i really did n't feel that beat a whole lot but nas and beanie 's verses was off the hook however that is not enough for me to give this album more than one star now i love mc lyte and public enemy but they should get smacked in the back of they heads with crowbars for lettin him mutilate their classics thats not musical artistry thats butcher work fake thug dedication really gets under my skin the title alone no disrespect to biggie as an artist cause i do like him still but they put a diss on tupac on life after death after he died then denied it for years so perhaps the fake thug dedication should be to him cause thats some sucker s i did n't hear his latest album i'm not going to review it i did n't even visit that section if you a fan of this guy then you gon cop this and his new one regardless if you like me and hate just about everything he puts out you wo n't be caught within a mile of that s	20

0	i had thought this would be full of dried fruits and nuts \( in other words healthful \) but it 's really just sugar laddened bits of hard fruits and only flavorless peanut pieces i have given the local food bank all but the one package i opened which made me feel so unwell that it 's now in the rubbish i am truly very disappointed in this product it 's description belies it 's reality if sugar is contraindicated in your diet steer clear of this product ! ! it 's low in salt and low in fat but so over sugared as to be actually nauseating it 's too bad because it sounded delicious and so nutritious all i can say is yuk ! ! ! i suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar is good for you	21
0	i ordered this and while i'm a fan of other therabeads products i found this poorly designed unless you have a very thick neck the velcro straps are worse than useless they either get in the way or cling to the fabric cover the only way i could get it to fit was to cross the straps in front below the neck and then it did n't cover the neck well	21
1	worked like a charm in my panasonic ag dv30 video camera ! having 5 hours of battery life really helps when you 're on vacation and do n't want to mess with charging batteries or being selective in your shooting this gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later worth the money and a good deal here	21
1	solas' previous cd quot words that remain quot is a classic in irish traditional music and the loss of karan casey certainly affects their sound on this album however instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and deirdre scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles i do n't think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music the instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high there are some lovely songs i like quot bonnie mae quot and quot miner 's life quot in particular and quot i will remember you quot is an original gem i am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of quot traditional quot music on the cd and about the use of quot rock quot instruments based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp uillean pipes wooden flute and fiddle \( tin whistle \( flageolet \) guitar mandolin bouzouki accordion and banjo being modern foreign invaders \) and what a pity ! what defines traditional is it pre planxty \? can no more traditional songs be written \? seamus egan and co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music \( rhythm and melody \) and have enriched it with a new chapter in general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective i would also highly revcommend liz carroll 's quot lost in the loop quot although if you 're a purist it has the solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of liz 's quot brand new quot traditional tunes \( brilliant \)	21

1	coming from a listener with a broad scope of musical preferences blues has always been a multi faceted genre which can be broken down into the categories soulful blues drinking blues and guitar blues b b king live at the regal is one of those recordings that just happens to capture all three this recording is dear to my heart as i can remember far back as first or second grade when my grandmother \( god bless \) used to play this on 8 track she used to love herself some riley blues brother king this recording always seemed to be in the player when my cousins and i would come over to visit and rest assured you will hear it before you left to go home at that time being the young naive kid that i was i remember saying that i hated it and that it was old folks music all grown up now in an age where real music is practically unheard of in terms of what these young artists of today release on cds i have a newfound respect for real stuff like this so instead of sitting around burning your brain cells trying to understand what this new generation is calling itself creating you have decided to come to one of the first sources for good old fasioned real music the blues in my opinion bb king live at the regal is one of mr king 's best recordings and with myself not being a big fan of live albums this is one of those rare live pieces that captures the essence of what a live recording should sound like maybe not so much in terms of the musicianship but the overall performance of those involved the arrangements were put together nicely the musicians were all in a very tight vibe on this album and whoever was on the mixing board did an excellent job of capturing this essence bb 's pickin' and crooning mixed with the superb playing by the band make this a wonderful place to start for the blues or bb king enthusiast it sounds as if it was made in a tasteful nightclub full of grown people who wanted to hear good music while having a good time the ladies were screaming and the gentlemen were cheering and bb was playing at his best the only gripe i have about this disc is that it is very short which was typical considering the age and time that it was made but still essential and a solid lesson for anyone interested in blues \( especially blues guitar \) i recommend getting this and bb 's live in cook county jail they both are live albums and both have some of the same songs on them but they were done in a different way and should still be heard good choice if you get this one	21

0	i played this at a friend 's party and it was a wretched party game it basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out it is incredibly monotonous and a throughly awful game to play at a party i admire its cleverness it took a lot of creativity and know how to make up these challenging puzzles but for the sake of all your guests i emplore you hide this boring game hide it as well as possible the painful thing is that out of a choice between mad gab and lost the game my friend chose mad gab it 's sad really	21
1	i got what i expected it 's functional and not too poorly made the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great the rolling wheels still have no function for me but they do n't get in the way	21

1	i was contemplating on getting the director 's cut of gone in 60 seconds until i looked at the time length usualy a director 's ct has more added to it not taken away believe it or not but the original released version of gone in 60 is 118 minutes long where the director 's cut release has a minute less footage for those that do n't care it 's not a big thing but for movie goers a minute off takes alot away unless you 're in it for the new extra features	21

1	i 've been a subscriber for over fifteen years and will probably continue to subscribe until the day i die but at times i find national geographic frustrating i have no interest in soccer nor do i want a huge fold out map discussing the sport are n't there more phenomenal things going on in the world today \? also geographic does have its pet topics how many articles must we read about pandas \? a dozen \? i like pandas believe me but surely there are other less cute animals to discuss also i could do without lectures and pc environmental propaganda the articles about oil drilling in alaska was filled with a thinly veiled agenda which was preachy and annoying yeah we get it you do n't want alaska drilled can we move on please \? other articles are quite interesting i enjoy the zip code discussion the old fashioned pictures and articles about countries i could do with fewer articles about underwater archaeology though and the articles filled with preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring a friend of mine \( a joe average type guy \) said he stopped subscribing to geographic because the articles were depressing him i tried to argue with him because i think the magazine is great but i do kind of have to agree the topics of late are downbeat and are n't particularly uplifting i do believe the magazine is getting a little 'out there' with its choice of topics too i recommend this magazine for those interested in the environment and the world around them	21
1	one thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate u s atomic clock in boulder colorado such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate furthermore such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price yet while most americans have for example the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks this model is just one of many styles sold by amazon and other vendors try one and i think you 'll be glad you did my wife and i have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted no what time system is in effect	21
0	this product came to me packed in bags not cans disappointed	21
1	i was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but i am soooooo glad i did try them bec now i am hooked ! ! ! ! yes they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off ! i make sure i rinse them really well in cold water right before i boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell ! i just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal ! i found the texture to be actually good like a firmer version of the ramen noodles ! i think these make an excellent snack or meal !	21

1	my cousin in law is thai and she cooked an amazing curry for us i had to have the recipe and she said it was really very simple just get the green mae ploy curry paste some asian basil and some coconut milk a little salt sugar chicken some bamboo shoots and rice were the only other things i would need to make it well i could n't believe it was really that simple but it was ! the paste imparts several subtle and delicious flavors to the curry tastes like you slaved for hours i never have leftovers when i make this curry the paste is so low priced i plan to stock up so i 'll always have some on hand plus no preservatives no wierd ingredients it 's all food stuffs albiet some of the ingredients i do n't recognize what is a galangal \? whatever it all is sure tastes good	21

0	these earrings were very uncomfortable i'm not sure if it 's actually the size of the post so much as the shape and angle more like an angled bar than a round post i do n't have particularly sensitive ears although i generally do n't wear large or heavy jewelry either these earrings are on their way back to amazon i also was n't thrilled to see how much the price has varied when i ordered 4 6 07 they were 34 99 some reviewers bought them for less yet the current price seems to be even more caveat emptor	21
1	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	21
0	not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on i would turn it off and on and nothing would help finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in this seemed to fix the problem a few times after that i thought it was just operator error but it was n't the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile an event came up about a month later i got my camera and tried to turn it on nothing happened so i changed the batteries still nothing happened i'm not sure what happened i do believe i purchased a lemon camera i'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time so i guess you get what you pay for !	21

0	right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i 've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks do n't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble	21

0	when my daughter was tiny she enjoyed being in this sling on the one or two occasions i managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes the cotton fabric does n't offer much support for the baby 's weight and i found it became uncomfortable very quickly it also did n't feel as secure as some of the padded over the shoulder style slings i actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times which defeats the purpose	21

0	i wish i 'd read the reviews before buying this product ! i would have saved us money and aggravation i bought these for my son 's christmas present this year he was really excited about playing with them with his sister the problem is we have n't been able to find one single spot inside or out where we can get reception on both units ! even when you can pick up one person on the handset the sound is so staticky and crackly that you can barely make out what the person is saying what 's the point \? my kids got so frustrated in the first couple of days that they dumped them in the toybox and have n't played with them since what an incredible waste of money and such a let down for the kids on christmas it 's pretty rotten that national geographic can conscience putting this piece of junk on the market do n't make my mistake heed these reviews ! this is a must avoid product	21
1	this cd is the funniest cd i own the first half of the cd is pure comedy and super funny the second half is a little hard to understand and it louds like is was recorded poorly that is why i gave it four stars track 2 is worth the money spent on the cd because that track is 8 mins of pure comedy eddie makes fun of stevie wonder and boxer larry holmes and he does it well	21
1	i bought this flash to use on my canon rebel xt the first thing i noticed was that without even reading the instructions i was able to get much better results on pictures taken indoors being able to bounce the flash off the white ceilings provided much better color contrasts to the built in flash even when i set my camera to shoot quick pictures in succession the flash did not let me down it did not need anytime to recharge at all i recently just came back from vacation and took a lot of outdoor evening shots most of the pictures came back with great results the only dissappointment i have is that when taking shots from further distance than i normally would the pictures came back darker than i would 've liked so to compensate for this i adjusted the flash exposure on my camera and although it was an improvement it was a hassle taking several test shots before getting it right another problem i have with the flash is the battery cover it 's flimsy and i find it awkward to open and close at times i always feel like i'm gonna snap it off by accident overall i am happy it 's a good flash for the price you pay the battery life is good i still have n't even had to recharge the batteries and i 've almost taken 200 shots with it my low light picture have improved dramatically by investing in an external flash anyone with a decent camera should never use the built in flash the difference is night and day	21
1	this samsung is the most reliable phone i 've ever had i 've had it for two years dropped it numerous times and it is still going strong with only a few scratches the battery life has declined during this period of time but it still lasts about two days before charging while it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now i am impressed with how many applications i use daily alarm clock scheduler memo pad etc reception is usually good too in all honesty though the camera is not terribly great pictures tend to have a weird color tint when you transfer them to your computer and are often blurry i still enjoy the camera if only for the fact that you can fiddle with the options \( black and white brightness flash etc \) to make pictures look decent the video option is rather lame though as the footage is choppy and you ca n't even transfer or send it to anything recently when i was on a shuttle two girls both with razors saw my phone and exclaimed that they used to have it as well both said they missed it and liked it better than their new phones i am supposed to be getting a new phone too but i know i will be keeping this one as a back up if you are looking for a decent and relatively cheap phone this is a good one	21
1	to learn some italian before visiting italy i tried multiple language learning programs borrowed from my local library some were ridiculous many required using a workbook then i stumbled on the pimsleur program which is totally audio allowing me to learn italian while i drove to and from work due to the pedagogically sound method pimsleur developed for language learning i actually did learn some basic italian as a result i bought conversational italian though i 've never considered myself adept at language learning i actually felt confident in my ablility to learn italian as a result of these cds i 've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language	21
0	i have ear gels before but none that were this cheap \( and i do n't mean cost ! \) there was no consistency in the size \( they come in different sizes but no two were the same \) and without fail every single one i tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece every one ! it did n't seem to matter if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear piece the material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance i am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere i seriously do not recommend these to anyone	21

1	i was unsure of whether to purchase this product when i saw that my printer \( hp deskjet 712c \) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews i tried it anyway because the price was right it may look a little cheesy but it works i did n't even need the cd that comes with it in order to use the product i just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new dell laptop and it worked i think i may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it very good product	21

1	i bought this dock from a seller called miga they did an excellent job of answering my questions on the product and sending everything in mint condition i use the dock for my hp r817 having read the reviews regarding the insert i just went through hp 's part site and ordered the correct insert for my camera it was only 5 \( before shipping \) and it arrived the same day as the dock package the dock transfers data so much faster then the cradle that comes with the camera plus it has an extra battery which would cost 50 and up by itself from hp i bought the dock for its dual charging ability for when i go on trips since this dock is less expensive then the fast charge travel kit i probably wo n't use the remote control feature or print images right from the dock but for what i will use it for its an excellent product for the price and i highly recommend it for you 817 818 users out there	21
0	i loved this game as a child and i spent many hours playing it i was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my laptop oops they didn t update any of the drivers for the first two games \( kings quest 1 2 \) so after about 15 minutes of playing you ca n't see the screen due to all of the graphic errors there are no patches available as of yet and it dos n't look like any are on the way i feel pretty ripped off it says on the cover in big print runs on windows xp barely and not very well when it does if you are interested in this game check to see if vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed better yet download one of the fan made editions for free online they work	21
1	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers the last ones stayed with me for three years they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily heat up fast great lasting curl \( particularly for hard to curl fine hair \) and do n't even need to leave them in that long would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl	21
1	we got an inexpensive potty first and it was not comfortable for our baby to sit on he would n't use that potty but he went on the bjorn the first time he sat on it the bjorn is shaped perfectly with a comfy back support and an oval shaped bowl so there is enough space for a boy to sit and pee it 's so comfy that he will sit and read a book ! looks great too simple and easy to clean	21
1	poison the well are one of those bands that i was really big on right when i first started listening to them but which faded a lot pretty quickly i ca n't really say why i like their work but it does n't inspire me the way it used to still i do like them and this album particularly maybe not as much as opposite of december but whatever yes this is n't as 'hardcore' as their older stuff but i 've never been hardcore kiddie \( i'm a metalhead \) and frankly being a modern hardcore band ai n't much of a compliment in my book it 's funny lotsa tech metalcore and other 'core derived bands are good but most straight hardcore metalcore is staggeringly boring so while old ptw was semi technical metalcore this album is pretty much just extremely loud emo but they now how to be 'emotional' and not come across as sissies \( well most of the time \) and jeff does n't sing in an unbearably affected manner course the 'extremely loud' part helps a lot too and jeff 's growls screams are absolutely devastating way better than on their previous albums and some of the best extreme vox from anyone ever as an extremely heavy emo album the instrumentation here is pretty bland there is n't much real riffing going on not in the metal sense anyway mostly just a single note chord repeated a great many times than another one etc but the vox and atmospherics carry the day the standout track is 'crystal lake' an absolutely bestial piece of deathcore i 've listened to quite a bit of death metal in my day but this has got to be one of the most devastating tracks i 've ever heard largely because of the absolutely impassioned vox lotsa extreme vox lack emotion but never moeria 's \( probably spelling that wrong sorry \) that and the instruments are more noteworthy very nasty and chaotic also it earns points for taking some of the seriousness out the genre with its jokey lyrics \( for the culturally backward this song is a first person narrative from jason voorhees killer of most of the 'friday the 13th' films hence the name 'crystal lake' \) there are no truly weak tracks here 'ghostchant' is a good opener nicely displaying the extreme tonal dichotomy of the album mixing the fierce screams with some nice melodic vox 'loved ones' is one of the very best tracks again carried almost entirely by the powerful vox tracks 5 is a cool two part thing mixing the rather pleasant harmonica and bass driven intro with one of the more hectic grinding main songs the album takes a turn for the lighter at about track 8 'apathy is a cold body' is a very emo y track but it 's got a lot of nice melody to it so it works 'sound like the end of the world' is another strange one it 's a slow doomy piece with oppressive atmosphere and a thick layering of vocal lines not the best thing here but it works and it earns some points for being different yes a solid if not great album check it out	21
0	a favourite writer goes to prison keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read then upon his release writes the worst book of his career the concept of the book is good as is the idea to blend the characters into the 9 11 tragedy the first 20 pages flow with typical archer style then the characters begin to make a series of continuously irrational decisions my personnal favourite is when 2 characters independantly consider driving either to canada or mexico in order to fly to europe during the 9 11 grounding of air traffic the idea that new yorkers would n't know that montreal is the nearest international airport seem laughable while there is a direct highway to montreal archer sends the main character to toronto which reqires a least 6 different highway changes is in the wrong direction and nearly twice the drive once at the border the border patrol guard turns out to be a world class art historian who apparantly does n't know that mcgill university is in montreal not toronto as is claimed by our hero the guard then remarks that he will meet a collegue of the hero when that peron travels up to the conference the idea that only one border guard is working the dozens of eastern us canadian border crossings with multi lane checkpoints 24 7 is simply the work of a mind out of touch with reality its fine to change details to enhance the plot and structure of a story but there is simply no benefit to this sillyness dan cormie	21
0	i have used turbo tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it this year however some genius decided to change the entire format and approach and i found this year 's version to be terrible very confusing now when used to be clear and simple hard to even download confusing up dates difficult to find numerous frequently used items \( estimated taxes paid in previous year capital gains losses state taxes paid and more \) the running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed i have zero confidence in this year 's program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years have recommended turbo tax to many over the years but would strongly recommend against buying this year 's product a perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software this one stinks	21
0	i have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear it 's unobtrusive and light however i constantly get complaints from whoever i'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet i have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset the problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth	21

1	this is a great walker the tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger my grandson just loves the walker and i do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely amazon sells model 14570 so do n't worry the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary also a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk	21

1	there 's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars because i think most people buy it for boats instead so i'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car in summary it works great it 's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty i'm never going to jiffy lube again it even works great on my lawnmower using the extractor is very easy just remove your dipstick insert the extractor 's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan \( it might take some practice to get a feel for this part \) once everything is in place pump 10 20 times this will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw it takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts that 's also why i recommend the 6 liter model instead of the 2 5 liter one so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way unfortunately i ca n't really speak to that because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate however the consensus from stuff i 've read on the internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor i always change my oil on time previously i drove for thousands of miles past my due date because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient the extractor should be used after the engine has been running the oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up making the extractor more effective also please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled most mechanic shops will accept your old oil \( i put it in a plastic orange juice container \) just call ahead to make sure	21
1	overall this is a very good remote it replaced 5 of my remotes which is all except my bose which is rf controlled it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my ps2 with no problems my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions are n't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set up these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again	21

1	i wish i would have bought this bouncer when i first found it my son was heavier and quickly outgrew his other bouncer this one holds up to 40 pounds i did n't buy it right away as it was a bit pricey for me so i tried to get it on ebay but was always outbid at the last minute then i realized that if those people could get 35 then i could too when i was done with it so i finally ordered it when my son was 6 months old and 19 pounds he loves it i love it it 's made very well if i had bought it when i first found it i would have gotten 4 more months of use out of it so do n't hesitate you wo n't be sorry	21

0	nighly stylized movie that uses sky captain cpg with an equilibrium theme in the future a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes i'm good with that part and mila jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `ultraviolet' what does n't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air there is no explaination how and the dumbass drones after her do n't have the same ability personally i wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded army of top notch killers ! the whole film is shot in cg touches a la sky captain and the world of tommorrow this supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world 's `vampire' problem in reality it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography normally i would have given this a 1 star poor piece of film period but after the resident evil series i felt mj did a very nice job here thus the 2 stars do not buy but wsit until it is on cable which i did even then i got it on starz and used dvr time	21

0	when i learned i was expecting triplets i bought a large inventory of these bottles which i thought were the best out there boy was i wrong ! these bottles leak not just once in a while but with almost every feeding i am constantly double checking them in hopes they wo n't leak all over my babies i now cover my babies with a cloth diaper so that they do n't get soaked when surprise ! the bottle leaks all over them yes i 've read the directions and no i do n't over tighten the bottles you ca n't take them with you for feedings on the go since they will leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag they are especially leaky when i prepare bottles in advance and store them in the refrigerator there is something about the cold or condensation that affects the seal the bottle must be disassembled the top wiped dry and then reassembled lots of fun with three bottles especially for 3 am feedings even if i am doing something wrong a bottle that requires this much precision in assembly not to leak is not a very good product if i had n't bought so many i 'd throw them all away and get something else take it from someone who is using these bottles three times as often they are a waste of money and a source of constant aggravation	21
1	this is awesome soup ! ! i was a little iffy about it \( about any soup coming from a can or bag ! \) but ordered it anyway it sounded so good my hubby toddler and i love it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it ! we took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with and everyone agreed how great it was not as good as home made but really really good ! i'm not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star but we all thought it was worth getting again !	21
1	i have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3 1m for the last few years to the canon 20d now what a pleasure to shot the battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots which should be sufficient for most anybody there is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera the lens choice was a great idea which came from an earlier review of the excellent walk around ability of this lens from the general shots to the closeups of those favorite flowers for those individuals who are on the fence about this product i tout it to all i have spoken to it turned a good photo experience on our west coast road trip into a real serious photo shoot it also uses the commonly accessable compact flash the built in flash works well have not had to explore the options at this time the delivery of this item when promised was a nice bow on the package	21
1	i do n't agree with the other review this doll is great to play with she has such a pretty dress and vail her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if your good with barbie hair its not a problem i would suggest that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me i still really want him the barbie with blond hair is also very pretty	21

1	i bought this yesterday when i knew i was going to a tailgate party where i would be away from the baby and having a few drinks and i may have to pump and dump i was nervous at first but this thing worked perfectly ! it worked just like it was plugged into an electrical outlet it successfully pumped my breasts in 10 minutes and it fits into the case next to the regular plug i also bought the medela sanitary wipes to clean the breast sheids since there was no sink near by this outlet plug is a must have if you want a quiet clean and safe place to pump your milk the cord is 8ft long so you can go back into the car i love this thing and wish i bought it sooner ! ! it will also be great on long trips too so you do n't get any clogged milk ducts highly reccommended ! !	21
0	this book was so badly written that i just could n't help writing my first review on amazon i never bothered writting reviews while i fully respect the authors' decision in providing the book online under the creative commons license and while i do not doubt the sincerity of their intentions the book is a total f ck up and f ck up is an understatement the book 1 \) is unorganized i felt i was being bombarded by information from all directions one moment i was getting ready to test a simple hello world module and the other i'm suddenly faced with a some strange esoteric block diagram showing how function calls and function pointers are used in a module to add new functionality to a running kernel with strange function names that were not mentioned and do not get mentioned for the rest of the chapter how the hell did i get here \? it just pisses you off and breaks your thought process and leaves you clueless and frustrated 2 \) is upside down i read chapter 3 \( char drivers \) and i compare it to real device drivers and some things just do n't match the book seems very theoretical because the real device drivers call some other functions that are not mentioned at all after digging in the kernel source files and googling the internet i realize that in the real world there is a whole driver model and generic objects and what not reading the source code documentation and some online material i actually understand how the real drivers work i still do n't understand the stuff in the book i start wondering whether there is any mention of the driver model and i find it in chapter 14 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the driver model seems in my opinion the first step to understanding how real drivers work and i find it after 14 chapters of utter nonsensce ! ! not only that the authors decide that many driver authors can ignore the device model entirely and the complexity of the device model makes it hard to understand by starting with a high level view surpisingly it was easier to understand from online sources and the source code documentation than trying to read chapter 2 in the book ! 3 \) is sadistic one thing i really hated was the carrot and stick approach the authors chose first they give you a small tiny taste of a topic which finally seems relevant and just when you feel you 're about to reach somewhere they do a complete u turn and throw all kinds of irrelevant off the topic rubish that leaves you sorry you were so shamefull as to expect any better you end up confused annoyed and duped like in chapter 2 when they presented the code for the hello world module ok fine seems easy enough you naturally assume that this is an invitation to write the same code yourself haha wroong ! the book suddenly does a make hello c without showing you the content of the makefile it leaves you out to dry with your uncompilable hello c and goes on describing in detail seemingly random stuff you are left wondering whether the makefile must have been something too obvious to bother noting down and you start wondering whether to try to create a simple makefile or continue reading the chapter as is i chose the former hahaha wroong agaaiin ! i ended up compiling my whole kernel source tree because of something they decide to mention only 7 sections later \( at least they mentioned it \? ! \) in summary i 'd suggest you buy the book and \( as documentation managementstyle for another book says \) not read it burn it it 's a great symbolic gesture i do n't think anyone could have done a better job at making a worse technical book if you come across any online material that recommends this book quickly discard that material too without thinking this is a 5 stars book it has affected me personally	21
1	based on the other reviews this grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my grandson 's first birthday present ! i am not the least bit disappointed colorful action packed activities everywhere sturdy easy to assemble cold weather friendly and perfect for the little boys in your life ! there are a lot of girlie playhouses but this one is the answer for boys my son put it together in about an hour and was ready for the birthday party guests happy grandmother	21
1	i love my nextel i530 purchased it almost a year ago now i am in northern ohio and travel many places around the state no matter where i have gone and i take my phone everywhere with me i have yet to find a place where my phone does n't have nextel service also very durable phone i live on a farm here and we use the two way often to communicate my phone in particular has been dropped several times once off a grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below and once also driven over by four wheeler in mud still works like new i am extremely happy with nextel 's service and phones i know several other people with different model nextel phones and also ca n't complain i would definitely recommend nextel over verizon alltel cingular and sprint other companies have such cheap phones it seems it 's a shame that sprint and nextel merged from my experience with sprint they are terrible with no service anywhere and their phones suck too	21
0	this is not a good product unless you 're willing to screw one of the parts into your door which we were not since it was a newly installed hi quality door and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so as a result the double backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off you ca n't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person \( large or small \) trying to open the door it just is n't going to hold up it 's a nice try but in the end was a waste of my money	21
1	i recently re read antony and cleopatra prior to attending the colorado shakespeare festival 's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in boulder drawn from sir thomas north 's 1579 english version of plutarch 's lives william shakespeare \( 1552 1616 \) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career around 1607 and published it in the first folio in 1623 it tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers roman military leader marc antony and the captivating queen of egypt \( and former mistress of julius caesar \) cleopatra when his wife fulvia unexpectedly dies antony is summoned from egypt to rome to mend a political rift with octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister octavia of course this news enrages passionate cleopatra she vents her anger on the messenger but is quick to realize that octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty however antony soon follows his heart back to cleopatra 's arms abandoning his new wife in athens this leads to war when octavius declares war on egypt after octavius eventually defeats antony at alexandria cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide which prompts antony to wound himself mortally antony dies in his lover 's arms and rather than submit to roman rule under the new caesar \( octavius \) the heart broken cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs in the end antony and cleopatra is as much about new sparks re igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes it is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re read and understand shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next g merritt	21
0	we bought this game knowing shrek movies are a bit raunchy but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play after watching my son play this game for a few minutes i saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive then after that he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died i ca n't believe a game that is rated e for everyone would have little kids \( or whoever played it \) have to be so mean to animals what 's next ripping the head off a rabbit \? i consider myself one of the coolest moms around but this totally crossed the line	21
0	we purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units do n't bother whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor 's baby ! what 's the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you ca n't then walk into the baby 's room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren \? \? \? \? they are getting returned right away	21
0	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat nhtsa \( national highway traffic safety administration \) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description	21
0	i hate hate hate this potty ! the shield will not stay on my son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying here you go it is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty there is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no go for a little boy	21

0	watching the show i thought that jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired for example even in the hot very humid atmosphere of houston tx it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy even after using his conditioner \( alot of it \) my hair looks awful after using it and the bottle claims that it does n't use toxic ingredients like mea but it does use three different types of peg a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes this is just as harmful as mea especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair and it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the peg products since peg is a thickener you 're also getting a diluted toxic solution even though head and shoulders uses mea i find that that even that works better than this my hair does n't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and i 've switched back to the other hair products iv'e been using it 's not worth your 20 dollars its barely worth 5 dollars my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration don't buy it !	21

1	i ca n't find on this website the exact tub i bought for my daughter but this tub looks most like it i tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub but that did n't work at all the small inflatable tub is definately the way to go my daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all it is a pain to blow the tub up but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall my daughter is nearly 1 year old now and has been using this tub for about 5 months there is still plenty of room for her to grow and i think she 'll be using this tub for awhile i feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub	21
1	i have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best the thickness \( 1 8 inch \) is just perfect not too thick so it 's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning what i really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip in a word it is comfortable	21

1	we got this seat in a different color for our first baby we feel very secure with it easy to install and a little hint they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars you do n't need it you can fasten the seat without the base the directions for it are on the seat i like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it and that it 's transportable to our stroller \( bough seperatly \) it comes with a head brace whatever those things are called to cradle the head those never do anything and are pretty useless but the seat itself is great	21
1	ms phillips certainly knows how to tug at those heart strings ! i felt as though i were right there with mac and sammy jo feeling the emotions they felt this is a great story that proves that true love can happen when it 's least expected and that true love always prevails i recommend this book to any romance lover	21
0	the hoover floormate was great the first two times we used it along with the old english it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution after using it twice it had difficulty dispensing solution from the reservoir this was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly it still got the job done not too long after that it would n't vacuum the solution back into the unit i got a great clean for the price divided by four uses you do the math i 'll stick to the cheap clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after i put the floor ex mate into the trash very disappointe	21

1	i will be utterly honest i do n't buy music cds anymore with so many bands hitting the streets faster than i can imagine i honestly cannot keep up with them all music begins to sound the same corporations seem to have their pre determined hit prior to the public even forming their own opinion those like the simpsons backstreet boys and even hip hop artists are blending together to sound uniform unoriginal and overly drab i had nearly lost my faith in music retreating to some of my older music like dmb counting crows and travis but then i found the suns stumbling around the internet i discovered shockingly one of the videos to their album called romantic death it was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that i have seen in quite some time then it hit me i could n't get this song out of my mind throughout the whole day i had the beat the lyrics and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind and i had only heard it once like a drug i needed more when i returned home that evening i found the song again and could n't stop listening to it for the first time in a long time i had found a new band then i bought this album knowing nothing about the band except for the romantic death song i put this in my dvd player and continued to be impressed their videos are just as smart as their music their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk rock and even hard edge their lyrics seem well considered smart and a voice to a new generation my favorites of the album are must be you romantic death \( parental guidance is suggested \) lost at home rockstop we tried in fact every time i listen to this album i find a new song to explore a new song to jam to on the way to work a new song to enjoy ! for those skeptical of this band i suggest this album to test your tastes not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other cds which allow friends and family to explore this band but also all of their energetic original videos that will never see the light of day on mtv but can be watched from the leisure of your dvd player the sun are a breath of fresh air to the music industry and this album finally got me out of the corporate rut that seems to be plaguing this industry if the rockstops it 'll be all my fault grade out of	21

1	i bought this chair for my third child and wish i would 've had it for the first two as well it is easy to assemble easy to use and easy to clean i like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit lay in it at a fairly young age i love the wheels because i could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner the one hand release on the tray is a dream for moms who could use eight hands ! my son seems to enjoy the toys too i only wish it came with extra trays	21

1	i first encountered bird3 opening for veruca salt the summer of 2001 that band had put their faith into bird and so have i we fell in love with them all together this band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul baring lyrics to create something unique beautiful and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today you 'll find yourself not only humming along but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments you will not once regret buying this piece of art	21
1	a friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the blackburn airfix after i bought it he has had many occasions where his chain has broken or his tires have punctured so he wanted to compare the weight of the blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides the airfix weighed in at about 245 grams about 8 ounces and his tools including inflator tire levers hex wrenches and chain tool \( all included in the airfix \) tipped the scales at 337 grams about 11 ounces i suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools but for handiness this seems hard to beat the blackburn lifetime no questions asked guarantee is also very attractive so while i have yet had to put this tool into action with either my trek 2200zr or my trek 6000 in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern pardon the pun i imagine i have made a wise purchase	21

1	i was introduced to the matthew shepard story by mtv 's dramatic presentation of matthew 's last days in laramie with that as my background i entered the laramie project with curiosity regarding the reactions of laramie 's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention matthew was a human being undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several laramie residents but not everyone shared that view that fact was refreshing the law enforcement officer who freed matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent other laramie residents were just as horrified the so called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected but equally unnerving this film though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed has the feel of a documentary knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times but the presentation was enlightening the film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that crimes no matter what a person 's viewpoint lifestyle or background no one has a right to take on the position of punisher humans are not animals or at least they should n't act like them the laramie project exposes the heart of many people after the matthew shepard murder it is worth the watch	21
0	the look and feel of this camcorder is very good unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities earlier i had a sony dcr trv140 which was way better than this camcorder this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it	21

0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	21
0	i have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem they are n't dragon feet but they do have to be softened pretty often i have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when i saw the artemis heel smoother advertised i decided i had to try it it 's a waste of money the appliance is no more than a low tech dreml in fact i have a dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better the artemis appliance does not scrape any dried skin away it merely sands your foot a bit that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on it comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma i would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing save your money	21
1	i 've used this along with the base station for one year now i 've monitored temp and humidity inside outside and in my rv parked in my driveway works great easy to use easy to change the batteries despite the instructions you can use rechargable batteries they read low on the display but work just fine	21

0	the prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again i was disappointed soon after when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle and then even that was disappointing i mean graceland for a first date \? i noticed a lot of similarities between roz and the mayor in northern lights and logan and nate from that same book none of them can talk in complete sentences and stella who comes across as this loving mother who puts her kids before anything else works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she is n't there to oversee everything even though the place has been successful for years there is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband she just does it unless of course it was in the last 50 pages which i did n't bother to read because i just could n't torture myself any longer and i'm a big fan of roberts i love her quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work but this just stunk because i could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be i'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out	21
0	i purchased this product after reading many negative reviews on other products \( my last internet security product was pc cillin i did n't renew because of the low ratings for 2007 \) what i found was that an huge load was put on my processor and system memory apparently because i use a program that feeds video over the internet from a network cam i never had problems like this before and after some research on the za support site i found other users who were having similar problems with their processors overclocking vsmon exe seems to be the culprit and is the main component of the zone alarm product everything seems fine as long as i do n't try to use video over the internet \( including im webcams \) i would recommend thinking about if you intend on using webserver programs before making this purchase	21

0	not what i expected when renting this movie as others have said clarissa came off too pure and innocent futhermore i do n't understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world \? everyone knows what lovelace has done there are numerous accounts yet she goes with him anyway \? blah the acting was ok the costumes were excellent \( i love period movies \) but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged and as another put it i was very glad when clarissa kicked the bucket i read a lot of historical fiction classic novels and love period movies but there was no liking this one it just couldnt be done	21

0	this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy does n't respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just do n't play the pc version borrow someone 's xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	21
0	we had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter well it is alot quieter than our monitor but like others said it makes this awful beeping noise ! it has gone off twice in the middle of the night before ! we also have another digital phone so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel i would look elsewhere for another monitor the beeping is what gets to me i dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night !	21

0	i have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and i have a lot of experience peeling vegetables i am fast and have rarely cut myself however i bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago i cut myself so severly with it i thought about going to the hospital this peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others i have used and so it some how gives me an quot out of control quot feeling with each thrust it is also extra sharp i ca n't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well	21

0	if you own a newer dvd camcorder that is manufactured by panasonic hitachi and others that records your movies in a vro format you can not use this product you will have to buy an additional program that will cost about 40 to convert the vro format to a avi wav or mpeg format if you own a camcorder that records in vro do some research before you waste 80 on this program	21
1	hiphop as a genre is so wide spread and international that sometimes we get wonderful creative jems like lady sovereign she is not only lyrically impressive but the mixes of electronics on all her tracks will get you moving which is basically what she sets out to do i dont know much about the hip hop insprised grime scene in the uk but i will definitely be keeping on eye out now and i will patiently await for s o v debut us album favorite track though all of it is really good will have to be the battle feature other grime scene artists like shystie zuz rock and frost p spitting the wildest \( barely understandable lol \) rhymes ive heard no men and women have battled against each other like this especially for the listening public how ever no one should compare sov to anyone \( missy or m i a \) all emcees particularly female one have a different style and should be prasied for such sov has a style totally different from anything ive heard to date it 's refreashing to see a new spin on hiphop	21
1	this is part 2 of a set titled say it right the cd has a blue and white style vs the part 1 that has a yellow and white style on disc and cover also in a slim line jewel case with the title track non album track but an added dance remix plus video if you enjoyed the first 2 track cd then this is a must dance lovers will definitely find this to be a totally spectacular production say it right radio edit has the catchy dance beats nice vocals excellent drums and chorus the lyrics are fun to sing along and strong in meaning apparently it 's about not giving a lover power to control destroy or make you loose sleep the melody has great rhythm chorus dance styles and energetic beats you do n't mean nothing at all to me is repeated showing a strong message that life does n't end with someone who is n't right what i wanted brings nelly to a slower tempo displaying depth of emotion it 's a slow ballad with true sincerity and humility it 's about going for something you wanted but never got the outcome does n't matter because the reality is you gave it your all as she sings about her dream and what she wanted it 's apparent love can be hard to let go yet comforting to do so the melody is soothing pleasant in sound and refreshing for the soul say it right peter rauhofer remix part 1 is a hot club remix sure to get you dancing off your feet the song takes a dive to faster paced trance like effects different introduction pumping jamming dance styles with techno flairs up and down tempos as well as plenty of percussion and synthesizers straying from the original song the vocals are still vastly heard yet filled with echoes swirls of sounds and much club ambiance it 's dreamy fantasy filled and definitely highly paced for the dance floor if anything is certain it is this the remix in this cd is much better than many of her past singles there is true dj styles incorporation more instrumentations effects and vast production much more geared to club hoppers and dance fans quite sticky infectious and groove like this remix will get you dancing up a storm feeling like wanting to shake your body non stop club lovers do n't pass this out nelly 's vocals are echoed often and electronic a effects are vastly hard say it right video enhanced cd is the video many have already seen as timbaland and nelly dance face to face and get very close as the message behind the music is reinforced this is an excellent video with much dance styles highly energetic beats and flairs for control and getting the message across overall from all of nelly 's singles i find this to be on the top of my favorite the combination of 2 highly emotional yet different songs plus a dance track and video makes this remarkable definitely buy this if you are a nelly fan club hopper or a lover of music to enjoy for the depth of emotion different styles displayed and the themes it 's definitely a top sensation before it sells out be sure to buy it the part 1 is also an excellent addition for those days you do n't want to listen to the remix this is highly recommended for sure !	21

1	tazo 's passion herbal infusion is a somewhat tart deep flavorful \( hibiscus y tasting \) tea it is not berry like in taste although it is red in color it 's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like but i find it a most pleasant taste my husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him although passion contains licorice root it is not sweet the ingredients in passion are hibiscus flowers natural tropical flavors citric acid orange peel licorice root cinnamon bark rose hips lemongrass and red poppy it is caffeine free ! tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea on the paper tea packet tazo writes a tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of passion as berry juicy wine like merlot sweet earthy dense tazo describes the aroma as sweet juicy red fruits i would rate this tea and tazo in general as very good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo passion gets only four stars	21

0	a good dozen years before his spectacular films of the late 70 's and mid 80 's allen got his name on the directorial map w this piece of fluff you gotta start somewhere tiger lily is more of a dry run for his later real comedies than an original film in its own right allen 's early work does tend to be stand up material thinly disguised as film many of the jokes are funny but the one note premise wears thin quick a must for allen enthusiasts and people who like quirky cultish so bad they 're fun movies	21

1	studio album released in 1971 by the original band a real band with alice cooper neal smith dennis dunaway michael bruce and glen buxton i think the other band members \( apart from cooper \) got the short end of the stick this album along with these 'love it to death' 'billion dollar babies' and 'love it to death' are so vastly superior to 'his' other albums the band plays and writes really well together as a 'real' band case in point listen to 'dada' from a few years later dreadful ! just wish he had kept a proper band together even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians rock is about feel more than technique in my opinion i ca n't even listen to 'dada' or	21
0	i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years this new model er430k is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement it 's nice and quiet and i'm sure the vacuum works great but i would n't know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim we 're talking about hairs easily 1 4 in length a trimmer should be able to shave those down do n't you think \? if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors do n't bother even trying this product it 's a waste of money	21
0	the case looks exactly as in the pictures above and the camera fits perfectly in it however the case is hardly a protection it 's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag the velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so i 've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around so my camera stays with me in any event there is a little strap on the case supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps but it opens too easily so it ca n't be trusted at all \( the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case which is not much \) there is also a small pocket in the back providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries \( 4 aa batteries \) and the usb cable again the velcro on it is too easy to open even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket definitely this is not designed as a practical solution just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches if you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun while not being worried of losing the case around or its contents don't buy this one spend some more money and get a decent carrying case i will	21
0	i did n't purchase this one it was a gift i was hoping for a laser printer like one of the brother all in ones i opted to install the lite version of the software from hp com i would suggest that everyone do this the lite version only has the drivers none of the hp bull software that is included usually the thing that bothered me the most was the automatic document feeder i would start a scan job and everything is going fine and then on the 5th or 6th page the whole process would just hang i had over 500 pages of documents to scan and this machine really let me down amazing how hewlett packard ca n't even write reliable drivers i gave the item 2 stars because i got it to print sometimes no buy	21
0	the dictators are incredible few bands can alternativly spoof and embrace the rock 'n' roll ideals as these guys have and their spinal tap meets ramones mees beach boys style almost always works almost manifest destiny is a dissapointing release from the 'tators i mean its not a bad album but the guys can do much better than this there are a few good songs disease is hilarious particulary the spoken word act from handsome dick at the begining science gone too far is one of the band 's catchiest tunes proving they were as good as any of the big names from the 60s their closing cover of the stooges' search destroy is an okay interperatation of the classic however that 's about it the rest are mostly humorless fm style rockers and while the dictators were n't selling out they were certainly trying to become more accesible download those three tunes and pick up every other album by the band	21

1	in america is a near perfect movie dealing w grief and learning to live again after tragedy it is also about hope the characters are engaging and each one is dealing with grief in their own way they are all trying to find a new life literally in amerca and figuratively w in themselves after a variety of tragedies and set backs the only real downside i can note on this movie is that i would have liked a little more back ground on frankie and mateo but i think the movie tries hard to put you in the midst of these lives without arbitrary flashbacks besides a great story the cinematograpy is well suited with its combination of views through a child 's camcorder and closer scenes of the city and family life i especially liked ths subtle way the camera shows the changing of seasons if you want to enjoy a good story and a bit of tear jerker thent his is a must see if for nothing else than the performances of mateo and young kristie just amazing	21

0	before you all dismiss me as an obsessive close minded thrash fanatic i thoroughly enjoyed chaos ad which was a sep' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal i like the idea of experimenting with tribal sounds but with those sounds max decided to throw in downtuned guitars not doing guitar solos excessive profanity lame i hate this i hate that lyrics and guest musicians the only decent songs on here are roots bloody roots and dictators everything else is awful this is n't sepultura this is soulfly i'm glad max left because if he stayed in the band sep' would have degenerated into a nu metal band for good sepultura albums get these instead \( starting with the best \) schizophreniamorbid visions bestial devastationbeneath the remainsarisechaos addante xxinationroorbackps you max fanatics need to cut derik green some slack he 's keeping sep' alive while max is making an arse of himself with soulfly	21

0	this so called game has a very good story and plot it keeps your attention by making you want to see what happens next however the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old why you ask \? because there is none you watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do there is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need oooooh there are multple endings whoopee ! you still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time i would estimate that i only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes this makes for a good movie but do n't buy it if you actually like to play your games instead of watch them	21

1	back to nature apple strawberry granola are an excellent product for a healthy breakfast or snack each flavor of the back to nature granola is tasty i would be careful before ordering this product in bulk my order of 6 bags came in this week and they are due to expire on september 15th i did not realize before ordering that this product was getting ready to expire and would not have placed the order had i known this as this is a food product it is not eligible for return so while this is an excellent product i would not recommend ordering this from amazon grocery unless you are prepared to have a bulk order of food that is getting ready to expire	21

0	as the opening cutscene introduces you to blinx the cat the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures i found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story the idea is that a secret off world clan of humanoid cat creatures armed with souped up vacuum cleaners are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map it seems that time when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats takes the form of one of five different brightly colored shapes if these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things they turn into monsters i could go on because the game certainly does n't stop there but i think you get the point i like to think that there 's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super detailed realism generally a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game because they 're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic lifelike location cartoons on the other hand generally do n't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time how much fun would the wile e coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics \? blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that 's overly detail centric in an environment that 's right out of a kid 's show the result is a tale that comes off as way way out of left field and almost completely abstract it focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer 's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic there 's a princess evil pigs have kidnapped her and it 's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world that 's it no side stories no reasoning no subplots just a straightforward rush from point a to point b and here i thought the phrase save the princess was universally recognized as an ages old cliche now i do n't want it to sound like i'm railing on this game just because it 's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor it 's also completely lacking in character development general storytelling and ongoing inspiration none of the characters in blinx really establish themselves as individuals including the lead character himself you do n't hate the pig on the spaceship because he 's trying to destroy the world you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money i honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three because she 's never mentioned between the game 's start and its finish i mean the very first super mario brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight i do n't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging the first level and a half are set up in the standard get to know you format with the simplest of enemies the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools shortly thereafter you 're thrown to the wolves for the most part the level designs are very short with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge i noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts whether it 's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk \( har har \) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point you 'll almost always know what needs to be done but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick i just ca n't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is if there 's a bottomless pit nearby \( and chances are very good that there is \) blinx will find a way to force himself into it regardless of what you 're hitting on the control pad if there 's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button he 'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room rather than the imminent threat that 's not to say that the entirety of the time sweeper is totally without merit because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings the ability to control time for instance was at the time a really fresh interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged you can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time knock the level into slow motion etc all the while blinx is moving around in real time it 's a great idea but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized why ca n't i use two controls at the same time \? why do n't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers \? why does n't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed up or rewind when i use my time powers \? why is their duration so brief and why ca n't i hold more than a dozen uses at a time \? i mean this could 've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run of the mill platformer the controls too are an undeveloped undertested nightmare blinx himself is often sluggish to respond especially when implementing his time controls he has difficulty making a precise turn whether on midair or on solid ground he stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks he routinely moves in the direction of certain death as though pulled by a magnetic field whether you 've instructed him to do so or not he 'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump particularly when attempting a difficult precise leap across a gaping chasm i think it 's these controls that most make blinx so mind squashingly aggravating at a glance you 'd imagine they 'd be fairly difficult to screw up you 've got a jump button a suction fire button a time control button and an analog stick to control movement plus there had already been a long established line of three dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title 's release paving the way to an ideal control experience super mario 64 had its issues sure but nothing like this and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre 's jump to the world of 3d it 's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway i ca n't even say i'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout the time sweeper either with the exception of the lead character himsef these are some incredibly cheesy preschoolish character designs they feel unfinished and hurried less purposeful than you 'd imagine \( especially in contrast with blinx himself \) particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury here 's a finely detailed main character with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again and he 's pitted against a set of monsters that could 've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four year old 's sketchbook despite featuring a spoken dialog track there 's no english voice acting i could n't pinpoint the language but my wife seems to think it 's either french or some close variation of it it certainly did n't sound japanese while this does add a touch of personality to the title and it 's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television everyone 's vocal personalities are so black and white too that i feel like a great chance to establish some much needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here the bad guys all have the same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while the good guys are all bright cheery squeaky and high pitched like the monkeys in super monkey ball it 's like a parody of the games that had come before but i wo n't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose overall blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package strapped to the shell of a far below average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public at the time of its release it was still in need of a lot of polishing some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality on top of that i really do n't know which audience they were targeting with it the game is ridiculously difficult which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there but so bright kid friendly and annoyingly cutesy that i ca n't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day the number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with blinx reaching near marvel vs capcom 2 levels with its unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially in later levels i have no idea how i acquired the willpower to finish level eight the game is adequately lengthy and offers some replay value with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials and the like once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super tough later levels though you 'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps \( i shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process \) and enjoy self mutilation i 'd recommend you stay far away	21

1	my first monk album was monk 's dream from columbia i loved that album 15 years ago and had been searching for the same satisfaction from the multitude of monk recordings from the blue note years presitge and riverside what monk 's dream offered that the prior work lacked was production raw edgy spontaneous yes all those recordings offered that but i longed for that sense of confidence tightness and richness of sound monk 's deream provided i found that in this set which makes sense since monk 's dream came out of these sessions at columbia so what if these are reworks of the old stuff they sound just as new and gripping quot produced quot as they did in their earlier days without big money helping out will i throw out my older stuff and just play this \? no chance there is a time for polish and a time for purity	21

1	bo derek plays the title role to perfection in this blake edwards comedy despite what the amazon capsule says julie andrews plays dudley moore 's girlfriend and not his wife watch the film before you write a summary of it ! along with the pink panther films this stands as one of edwards best films it is a high point in the career of dudley moore and he is just perfect as george robert webber also is good as george 's gay cowriter and friend andrews is fine also but what you leave the theatre with is the images of bo derek someone knew how to cast the title character perfectly	21

0	after my trusty archos player 's display broke i figured i upgrade and get me a 60gb iaudio x5 as a journalist doing interviews i was also very giddy to get the line in to record interviews straight to mp3 a friend of mine loves his player so i did n't even flinch when i saw the price ever since then i regret my decision apparently my player has a software problem it speeds up all my mp3 files i tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing that is when i was actually able to upload mp3s because oftentimes i received error messages and the player refused to do as told so what then upgrade the firmware sure if you can make it work and i could n't the description online is poorly written but it 's essentially like this start with a fully loaded battery unplug the a c cabel and unpload the firmware now replug the a c cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware well all it does is conclude that the battery is n't full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else i e i could n't get the firmware to update and i tried for the last hour therefore i 'll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund and i 'll get another archos and continue to live with its misely 20gb	21

1	in 1976 my fair lady returned to broadway in a revival touted as the 20th anniversary production perhaps most famously this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called christine andreas at long last this much sought after cast album gets its cd premiere christine andreas is one of the best eliza 's ever captured on disc and ian richardson 's performance as beleaguered tutor higgins is full of wit and humour george rose \( in a tony winning turn as eliza 's dustman father \) is very enjoyable in his main numbers with a little bit of luck and get me to the church on time jerry lanning also makes for a fine freddy with the winsome on the street where you live this recording also features the embassy waltz sequence which was never included on the obc and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the olc the production itself heavily recreated the original production complete with oliver smith 's sets and cecil beaton 's costumes hanya holm 's choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain crandall diehl christine andreas picked up a theatre world award for her breakthrough performance the show opened at the st james theatre on march 25th 1976 but later moved to the lunt fontanne theatre where it closed the following year after 377 performances the following year andreas returned to broadway in another important revival the 1978 production of oklahoma ! in which she made a thrilling laurey \( cast album available on rca \) before cememting her position as broadway 's ingenue of choice with the role of frankie frayne in the 1983 revival of on your toes \( cast album available on jay ter \) more recently she played marguerite st just in the original company of frank wildhorn 's flawed scarlet pimpernel \( cast album available on atlantic \) i heartily recommend this particular my fair lady	21

1	plot summary a man without a memory found floating in the mediterranean sea searches for his identity discovering along the way pieces to the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly trained government assassin reason for the rating violence and some language based on the robert ludlum authored book by the same name the bourne identity is part action flick part stylized thriller in his first role as an erstwhile action hero matt damon shines as bourne imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable in his own skin even though he does n't know who he is ease as the story opens bourne is pulled out of the mediterranean sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an italian fishing boat the hey this is a story about espionage theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from bourne that displays what we later learn is a swiss bank account number upon finding and opening the safe deposit box bourne discovers multiple passports \( including one with the name jason bourne \) a variety of foreign currency and a gun he then begins his search to uncover his true identity and until now so does the audience if there is one misstep in the bourne identity it may be the fact that early scenes involving the cia and the agency 's frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to bourne 's identity far earlier than bourne himself at this point the film becomes more of a how will he survive \? thriller rather than a who am i \? mystery a love interest of sorts \( played nicely by run lola run actress franka potente \) gives bourne a partner in crime to play off of for much of the movie but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development an implied \( off screen \) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief but does n't detract too much from the action the most interesting \( and morally significant \) moment in the film comes when bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on through this pivotal flashback \( and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense \) we learn that the highly trained killing machine is n't capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target 's children in the room with him bourne 's hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film 's premise as he is shot falling into the mediterranean sea smartly directed the bourne identity is fast paced without feeling rushed the cinematographer paints the european setting in shades of grays and yellows giving the movie a unique noir like look that fits well with the drama as an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities this film is a winner for older teens and adults nappaland com recommends ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride the bourne identity is a worthy discovery after the show if members of your family choose to view this movie use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward what do you think prompted jason bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht \? what does this say about bourne 's moral compass \? how would you feel if you suddenly could n't remember who you were \? what actions would you take to discover your identity \? when faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done jason bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew when have you felt that way \? how can a relationship with jesus give us a second chance in the truest sense \? s	21

0	i bought this cushion because i had to move from california to new york and expected the drive to be torture on my back i researched these types of cushions and decided to get this one because it has a lot of motors compared to cheaper units and because i had recently bought a mogu pillow and really liked the soft feel of it this cushion has sqush which has a similar feel the cushion has a middle portion of sqush which is concentrated into 3 lumps at your shoulders lower back and under the front part of your thighs near your knees the lumps are soft and squishy and are covered in a spandex like material the rest of the cushion feels like fleece when i first plugged it in i was immediately disappointed in the weakness of the wimpy motors even at the highest intensity \( i never even bother with the lower two \) it felt like nothing more that a moderate vibration definitely not enough to un knot an aching back the pre set programs are fine but i rarely use them it comes with straps but i had a hard time trying to install it in my car because the instructions were non existent and it was n't intuitive at all i ended up just attaching them to some hardware on the underside of the chair which worked well i ca n't decide if the cushion made the drive any more bearable the lower back cushioning filled my lumbar region fine but the shoulder padding must be too thick because it pushed my shoulders forward and forced me into a slight hunched position which strained my back and made it hurt the thigh cushioning made it slightly difficult to slide into the seat because it effectively raises the level of the seat \( my car does n't have fancy seat controls \) and i had to wedge myself into the seat the massaging feature was helpful because it was a fun thing to do on a boring drive and it helped a little to keep the circulation going but it simply was n't powerful enough to be really effective the worse thing is that the thigh motor died only a few hours into my trip ! ! it has a 2 year warranty but you have to pay a 5 handling fee ! i'm mad at myself for throwing away the box because if i had n't i 'd return it to amazon and wash my hands of it overall this cushion is underpowered unreliable and not as orthopedically correct as it should be it is definitely not worth the outrageous price i regret not buying a simple lumbar cushion instead i wish i had saved my money for homedic 's highly rated shiatsu seat cushion instead although i'm somewhat leary of their product reliability now	21

1	although i do n't own my own xbox i always play someone else 's because i already own a ps2 i never the less feel obligated to add my thoughts on the matter the new xbox controller s is one sleek piece of equipment far superior to that original monstrousity of a controller those idiots at microsoft initially came up with \( it was that super ugly gigantic and clunky original controller that turned me off from buying the xbox when it came out \) the new controller s is visually appealing to the eyes although the ps2 controller is still slightly more attractive the controller s is an extremely close second the controller s is smaller and handier than the original has easier to use controls and is very comfortable to grip just compare the different controllers of xbox ps2 and gamecube by holding them in your hands and fiddling around with the controls you will see that the xbox controller s has the nicest fit of them all on the palms of your hands \( the gamecube is the least comfortable \) ironically the controller s was originally designed for the xbox release in japan because the original controller was deemed too big for japanese players i really think those folks at microsoft should plan things a little better before jumping in to the game	21
0	look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while i say it 's flimsy because it 's so skinny other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you 're stabbing into cuts of meat this smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more i say just get the larger one that 's more stable and takes less effort	21
1	i purchased this wonderful blanket for my baby my plan was to carry it along with me whenever i would visit family and friends at their homes i could then lay my baby down or interact with my child on a clean surface the blanket is 16 0 x 4 0 x 11 0 inches which will accommodate adults well i was pleased when i received the blanket to have discovered the excellent craftsmanship that was put into the creation of the piece the quality is absolutely top notch ! the surface material also seems like it could be easily cleaned if a spill should occur the only slight con i have of the essentials blanket is that it is a bit on the heavy side this is only a negative if one is expecting to carry it for a long period of time otherwise i adore this blanket and highly recommend it	21

0	i really do like my senseo coffee maker i like others who have reviewed the kona pods here was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine i was excited to see that kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style' i have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one after reading some of the reviews here i could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable it just did n't make sense well it still does n't make sense but it certainly happened with the coffee i made using the kona pods also my results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the kona pods cost a lot more than folgers or other pod brands that i can buy locally the first thing i noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod i have ever used in my senseo the instructions for the kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine the kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package i always wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the senseo after my problems with the kona pods my husband decided that i was not 'wiggling' them enough he promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open so there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine the first thing that i noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods that did not make much sense but after several cups of kona it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods the best i can figure out is that the kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water there is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done the pod itself is heavier when i take it out to throw it away so i believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup then as others have mentioned there is the problem that happens to me about 1 2 the time when using the kona pods the problem is that for whatever reason the water does not actually go through and penetrate the kona pods during the brewing cycle the 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water ! this problem is one that i still cannot really figure out the kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods i have tried so i guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee i also wonder if the paper filter of the kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate i have tried wetting the kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod but that has not worked for me so it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me i have wasted too many expensive kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them even when the kona pods brew a cup of coffee it is not as large of an amount of coffee as i get using other brands so adding the cost of the kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work i have been reading of a product called an ecopod it is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers it might be the next thing i try	21
0	my son hit 515 as an 8 year old last year this year he moved up a division and has struggled at around 250 even though he has a fairly nice swing using this device for two weeks he suddenly ca n't hit anything i pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60 ! the problem with this device is that the ball does n't drop like a pitched ball so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal i 'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son 's swing and confidence do n't get me wrong the kids love it the entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it it 's great for use around the house just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you could n't otherwise beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and do n't let it replace live pitching fun factor is a 5 but as far as a training device i have to question its value	21

1	back in the 1980s back before every television show was csi city of your choice and law order crime division of your choice there was a veritable plethora of well written clever hour long mystery programmes magnum p i murder she wrote moonlighting hart to hart the a team to name just a few and this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from \( not counting pbs \) but far and away the best of these mystery shows \( and perhaps the most under rated \) was remington steele in which pierce brosnan \( with second billing ! \) and stephanie zimbalist fought crime with style dash wit comedy and a bit of romance the series with its rat a tat dialogue vaguely deco feel \( a slight deco revival was the only good thing about `80s d cor \) and occasional zaniness at times harkens back to the wonderful preston sturges esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and `40s indeed it 's clear from the moment that brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of classic hollywood but he was a cary grant for our times devastatingly handsome in dapper saville row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as grant 's \( as an aside it 's also clear that brosnan was born to play james bond truly who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor albeit belatedly \? we wo n't get into the infamous season five vs bond debacle \) in the entertainment field there are actors with a lowercase a \( pretty much everyone falls into this category nowadays \) actors with a capital a \( truly impressive sorts such as judi dench vanessa redgrave and anthony hopkins \) and then there are stars brosnan is clearly the lattermost bright and luminous zimbalist as sleuth laura holt is spunky and makes a valiant attempt to be rosalind russell to brosnan 's grant but somehow she falls slightly flat nevertheless there 's no denying the chemistry between the two which is what really makes the show \( this is particularly remarkable considering that the two notoriously did n't get along whilst filming the series \) references to classic hollywood are constant and amusing remington steele the \( sort of \) reformed con man with a heart of gold has an encyclopedic knowledge of film and often inadvertently stumbles across the solution to the weekly puzzle by drawing a comparison to a classic film \( joseph cotton orson wells `the third man ' british lion film corporation 1949 is a particular favorite throughout the run of the series as are cary grant films and ironically the occasional bond reference \) the show was scored by the wonderful henry mancini he of charade \( a grant reference yet again ! \) the pink panther and breakfast at tiffany 's fame \( among many others \) which of course adds to the caper romantic feel of the show \( by the way i 'll take the somewhat chaste clinches of remington and laura over the sordidness of sex and the city to daydream about any day of the week ! \) i'm so pleased that remington steele has been released on dvd i was seven years old when it debuted and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time \( i was a sophisticated child \) but i had n't seen it since and once again have found myself charmed by each and every episode for those who are too young to remember the series check it out it 's much more worthwhile than anything on the air now and for those of you who do remember it revisit it 's worth your time and money	21
0	as a dad i was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2 year old this book is lousy though why \? 1 stupid writing i got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy witty remarks dancing the potty mambo \? give me a break ! 2 stupid advice this book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he she is an adult i'm sorry but a 2 year old just cannot comprehend a long drawn out explanation of why you want them or do n't want them to do something how about just saying do n't do that ! or hey you want to try this \? that seems to work just fine for me why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something \? what 's wrong with just telling your kid what to do \( nicely \) and expecting them to be obedient \? 3 repeating content this book kept repeating itself over and over okay i got it already ! i strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200 page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages \( or less \) 4 too many references this book constantly refers to other chapters i once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page i am not kidding ! huh \? is potty training really that freakin' complicated \? all i want is some general ideas on how to go about it how to get started and a few good tips i do n't need all these detailed references \( nor do i need the phrase potty mambo repeated to me ad infinitum \) here is all i wanted to know how do i get started \? what do i do \? how often do i need to try it \? should i go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment \? maybe this book got to all of that but i quit after page 60 i just could n't take it anymore after hearing the phrases stay positive and potty mambo repeated to me for the umpteenth time i had to quit i returned this book and got my money back if i were to say anything good about this book i would say that it has a few good tips surrounded by about 180 pages of filler potty training still looms ahead will i be successful \? probably but to this book i say no thanks	21

0	i was very excited when i got my copy of this book i am a big fan of medical thrillers i started with robin cook and michael palmer and from then on i was hooked unfortunately for me i selected the wrong book it was very slow and he did n't pick up the pace until i was about 60 pages from the end then all hell broke loose i have a feeling that josh got a little help from people telling him to spice it up all in all i was disappointed and still do n't know what perv means hope he does better on his second i will give it a try but only the first 50 pages if he has n't hooked me by then i 'll give up	21

0	ok check it out there 's two jack blacks one is the guy from tenacious d you see him all the time he 's funny and childish and insane then there 's the other jack black he 's the evil creature who pervades films like shallow hal and king kong whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident well as long as you are n't fat and do n't feel patronized by gweneth presuming to know what it 's like not to be desired all her life \( ha \) then by all means suspend all disbelief logic and brain power and watch this dumb movie gweneth 's fat suit is actually pretty convincing although most of the movie she 's played by an actual fat chick who by the way should have just been left in without the whole ha ha the dude thinks she 's skinny nonsense obviously a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if a \) he were n't brainwashedb \) his fat girlfriend was n't replaced by a twiggy blond chickc \) the movie did n't throw ridiculous concepts your way \( like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it \) d \) tony robbins was in no way involved whatsoeveri knew i was slumming it when i saw this movie but i'm not sure what the message of this film is jack black 's character is decent considerate great with kids and perfect in every way oh except he 's really shallow for no dicernable reason other than his dad 's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail the weird part is that hal 's not a bad person the movie beats you over the head showing you he 's the nicest guy on on the face of the earth so you ca n't really laugh at him looking like an idiot rosemary is so fat she has superpowers her butt actually creates typhoons \( i wonder if that has military applications \? \) suddenly hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews tony robbins brainwashed him the fiend ! when hal finally realizes this he decides to \( ooh big spoiler \) love rosemary anyway and learns a valuble lesson along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he 's dating rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non judgemental he is dating a fat girl \( 'cause that would make any woman melt \) of course there 's requisite best friend played by jason alexander who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get hal to dump her then again the friend is a complete troll so i do n't know why hal would want him around and to insult us further they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a serious note about how true beauty is on the inside too many public service messages ! pick one ! ! but brain dead writing aside paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit \( despite gweneth 's postering when this film was first released \) regardless of its clumsy benevolence i have to rate this as a romantic comedy and for that i give it a rating of totally unremarkable nice gesture farelly brothers not to be bothered with	21

1	dr amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family the stigma associated with mental illness is deep seated and difficult to overcome understanding the root causes particularly the genetic predisposition within families is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life long problems these problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse they do not deal with the biological root causes once those are dealt with the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life however without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch take my advice if the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar get help as recommended you will become a new person the one you were created to be and that is a wonderful thing	21
1	i 've been using my t809 since january and mostly love it three main problems 1 \) there is some sort of pinhole leak in the upper right corner of the screen where dust gets in behind the screen lens looks like crap when the display is inactive i 've read that other people have this problem too 2 \) i hardly ever use this as an mp3 player because you have to use their poorly designed headset \( they wo n't stay in my ears ! \) and because you ca n't hear the phone ring over the headset while listening to music 3 \) the ring starts off softly and builds to a louder volume if i have the phone in my pocket i miss the first couple of rings \( too quiet \) and by the time i realize i'm getting a call and fumble to get it out of my pocket i 've usually missed the call this sucks and i do n't think there 's a setting to disable this feature it 's close to ideal but no cigar camera 's great reception 's great easy to use but i 'll probably look for something similar but better after my contract expires btw if you get insurance thru tmobile for any phone make sure you see it on the bill i had a problem with water damage three weeks after buying tmobile claimed i never asked for insurance but fortunately amazon exchanged it	21

1	the military courtroom drama a few good men is one of those films that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it 's own but even with countless viewings it retains it 's emotional power and speaks to us about issues that have become more important than ever in the film we meet lt daniel kaffee \( tom cruise \) a young successful military lawyer who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases that supposably he 's never even seen the inside of a courtroom he is assigned the cases of pfc louden downey \( james marshall \) and lance cpl harold dawson \( wolgang bodison \) they are accused of murder and a host of other charges when at the guantanamo bay military base they performed a code red \( an illegal form of discipline within a military unit \) on pvt william sandiago which unintentionally resulted in his death while the two accused marines admit they did the code red both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors which includes base commander col nathan jessup \( a brillaint jack nicholson \) a powerful highly decorated officer who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command with both time running out and a lack of legal evidence kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy through a brilliant script \( based on the play by aaron sorkin \) rob reiner 's steady direction and the cast 's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as code honor discipline should a soldier always follow orders no matter what \? whats' more important our ethics principles \( on which this country was founded \) or our need for security \? is col jessup right \? can we not handle the truth \? it 's hard to believe that this film was made way back in 1992 in this post 9 11 post abu grebbe world where our country is on a war footing the questions that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever the film is filled with great performances while i am not normally a huge tom cruise fan i have to admit that cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer the same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from demi moore kevin bacon and kiefer sutherland but what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant dynamic performance that comes from jack nicholson when cruise puts nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on you just watch in awe as nicholson just continually builds the character 's palpable anger until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous you ca n't handle the truth speech even though the speech and nicholson 's performance has been endlessly quoated parodied when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance if you are interested in seeing a well made movie courtroom drama that is both thought provoking and entertaining then i highly recommend a few good men	21

1	i received the chia herb garden about 3 years ago and not only was it easy to start but most of the plants are still going strong i have more chives and parsley than i know what to do with these are also some of the tastiest herbs that i 've ever eaten	21
0	i was given this as a gift and i was very excited to use it out and about but when we were out in the restaurant they did not stick and my daughter could easily pull it off plus when we were all done i had to try to clean it off as best i could then put it in my diaper bag yuck ! i much prefer the plastic disposable tablemats that stick on the table	21
0	the good this software completely locks down email access internet access network access etc the bad this software completely locks down email access internet access network access etc the ugly i bought a new notebook i was going nuts trying to figure out why outlook would n't send receive emails my wireless connection would n't work why new software i was installing would n't update over the web it was taking 5 10 minutes just to restart the computer ! ! ! hmmm all these issues started after installing internet security 2005 to be fair i said ok better make sure i have this set up right so i took a step back went to symantec 's site and spent time learning to properly configure the settings software etc ok great my bad right \? wrong when i tried adding comcast 's server addresses to the trusted list nis 2005 would freeze up i would have to reboot and 10min later the same thing to make a long story short i would not reccomend this product for anyone with less than 110 of patience and complete understanding of the product installation and set up the best thing about nis 2005 was it only took 5 minutes to uninstall	21

0	the software to this mp3 player made it too much work anything that freezes up my computer has to go here 's my experience i purchased this player on february 23rd and returned it to the store on march 8th i was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try i installed the software with no problem but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players i just did n't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files i did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine it had a very nice sound easy to use and wonderful to carry around i listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge fast foward week 2i wanted to delete some files and add some new ones i opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as i did at first first the program began running really slow and then froze i ctr alt delete and started over it worked for a second and then froze again i rebooted and it did the same thing i came back to it the next day and it did it again i uninstalled it \( so i thought \) and it continued to freeze it does n't completely uninstall off of your computer i know this because i did n't have to re authorize my computer to use it again i had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer there are lots of hidden files in conclusion had it not been for my experience with the software i would have kept the player	21
1	this is the second time i 've bought these for my dog although they are not dog treats my dog loves them she is very special to me so i get her the best this is a great price for these slim jims if i buy them in the store i pay alot more for them i 've tried them also their very good they come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time just like the ones they sell in the stores if you buy them one at a time at 25c a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them i think this is a great value !	21
1	i have had this winder for about a month now and i am very happy with it the major convenience is the well engineered slots and iserts holding watches that are of a very good quality the inserts are holding watches steadily which contributes to proper winding all previous more expensive winders with cushion type inserts were falling out \( with watches ! \) and eventually were rendered useless highly recommended unit	21
0	i bought this camera in about february 2005 but did n't know enought about digital to know what i can actually get goes through batteries pretty fast the recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture i just thought this was normal for digital cameras till i began reading later reviews then i accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface \( loose dirt and sawdust \) and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on contacted hp to get it fix but will cost close to 100 and they will just send a reconditioned one so i am in the market for another digital camera maybe a canon or sony or something besides an hp	21
1	it clearly says it is a mesh dress ! i wore this for my wedding outside in bright sunlight and it certainly did not show everything but do not expect it to be completely opaque as it is a mesh dress with delicate lining as for the quality it wore well and the frayed edges are intentional and part of the design very fairy like and pretty and i was pleased to wear it	21

0	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just 5 months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player	21
1	i love it ! it 's really light weight and portble the batteries do go dead without the charger and the pvds should have more then 30 minutes 60minutes i like this video now alot calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it 's wonderful i hope you buy it !	21
0	i have not been able to get this to work again it was great for the first week then it made my computer crash and now i cannot get it installed again i am not sure i like that	21
1	i very much like these earrings my only reason for not giving them a 5 star rating is that the topaz is quite small you really have to look closely to see it but they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful i recommend them just be aware that the stones are tiny	21
1	espresso beans can be roasted in different ways lavazza and illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for italian espresso illy roasts their beans for a longer time but at a lower temperature than lavazza as a result of its higher roasting temperature the lavazza is darker and according to some people more robust than illy is at its best when properly ground tamped and brewed lavazza espresso is a bit stronger tasting and also a little bit more bitter than illy the lavazza espresso also has a very pure black color once brewed and when it is done properly it has a hint of licorice in the aftertaste personally though i prefer the illy approach which is why i am giving this coffee four rather than five stars but even so i certainly recognize the high quality of lavazza in my opinion lavazza represents the very best of the widely available dark \( as opposed to medium like illy \) italian espresso roasts	21
1	this sauce is medium heat for everyday use it has an excellent roasted pepper flavor and there is no vinegar to get in the way consequently you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it an every day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue this is not a boutique novelty it 's a household staple the 32 oz size is the right size for a hot sauce household you want good \? try tapatio on cottage cheese you 'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again i promise i use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream but my personal favorite applications of tapatio are eggspotatoespizzaanything creole \( forget tabasco ! \) cottage cheesemost ricemac cheeseand of course mexin my opinion this is the best sauce in your local grocery store	21
0	this is a hollow ground blade \( not flat ground \) which does not cut straight the blade tends to want to rotate in the cut because of this get a knife with a flat ground blade not this one you can see the ground part at the bottom of the blade it is a cheaper way to make knives	21

1	wild orchid most people think its some smut movie with no plot no one ever looks between the lines it may have sex and some crazy acting and even a bogus plot but the theme of it is important true love call me sentimental and a hopeless romantic but this movie touched me emily and wheeler opposites in every way somehow find love together i wish everyone was as lucky to find happiness where you least expect it i wish i could be as happy as those two look around you do you see people with this kind of passion and love \? it 's sad too because we know what happened to the actors who played these lovers i hope that someone out there has a relationship like this so that we have more to cling to then fiction it may not have been the best movie but it had an important message when you find true love grab it with both hands and never let go	21
0	i saw this on tcm years ago and i thought what is all the fuss about i do not like how it glorifies that leaving your wife and kid is swell the men look more like lady 's then the men in this movie that are after her also this movie is so long and boring do n't get me wrong i like foreign films even the ones that are slow like wild strawberries umberto d and such but this one did nothing for me another thing his wife is alot more actrative then the woman he desires you can tell i did not mention character names well i forgotten them i only seen this moive me once and that was enough a other thing i need to mentin why is that criterion charges so much for there dvds other dvds are restored as well and they are cheaper and most of chiterion dvds do not even have a whole lot of bonus features	21
0	having avoided seeing this film i found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on brought tuesday unbiden into our home my aversion to oprah and her ilk does not cloud my dislike of this film a bad film is a bad film devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned and directionless directing this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned to me a reasonable premise should move a story forward something should occur my interest should be engaged this film takes reams of pre packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses and attempts to build the plot from words alone it is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said hey this book is full of words lets make a movie in a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting to be honest jack lemmon was not very good in this film he played the same character he always did just older hank azaria was just awful he talked as if his mouth was filled with stones and was wooden and expressionless maybe he was too embarrased to be there as to the other actor 's well they filled up the space nicely the look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality the sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was they even covered the green leaves on the trees some better acting some good r rated dialogue and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film as it stands however it will only be of interest to fans of oprah and dr phil etc the purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves it is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases a good cry and a genial talk show presenter will somehow make it all better i for one think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial then pull the finger out and just get on with it \( to the grammar and form police i did have this in paragraphs but the editing process scrunched it all together sorry	21
1	i am a firm believer in the health benefits of hemp this product is the best i 've found the delivery was very prompt and efficient	21
1	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	21
1	although i'm not new to wwii histories the first world war is one of my favorite historical periods to read about and one of my favorite books from that war is alistar horne 's the price of glory since i enjoyed reading about one if wwi 's most epic battles i did not hesitate to read stalingrad the fateful siege by antony beevor in both works comparisons are made between the battles of verdun and stalingrad and for good reasons both battles were initiated by german forces that underestimated the tenacity of their enemy the course of battle spun wildly beyond their commander 's control and both battles cost a near unimaginable loss of life and human suffering beevor is especially keen on the amount of human agony throughout the battle of stalingrad which makes the book gutwrenching but at the same time the reader is unable to put it down from the well documented cold lice and hunger that haunted russian and german soldier alike to the disease and desperation experienced by the sixth army as they were slowly strangled in zhukov 's trap it seems that beevor has overlooked nothing unlike many battle histories that may focus on stategy or political fallout of the conflict the emphasis on human suffering and heroism in beevor 's work makes the reader sympathize for russians germans romanians and anyone else unlucky enough to get caught in the battle not only does beevor shed light on the plight of ordinary soldiers he also examines the more famous players in the battle including a paranoid stalin a dreaming hitler a finger pointing von manstein and a indecisive paulus indeed the reader gains perspective from rastenburg and moscow all the way down the heirarchy to the frozen bunkers of stalingrad overall stalingrad the fateful siege is an excellent book that is recommended for anyone interested in world war ii or just any hard hitting military history	21
1	purchased the batman laptop computer at target for christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old he was totally drawn in because it is batman but the games kept his interest the entire family enjoyed trying the different games dad a musician enjoyed the music game graphics are super i love the way batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even worth the 38 99 i paid at target on sale for sure	21
0	okay for starters i did look at the various other reviews and thought i would take my chance it seemed the good outweighed the bad until i bought it and am trying to install it \( as we speak but got irritated so am taking a break to write this \) where to begin the locking mechanism seems to be fine if you can get it to install in the first place however the manufacter only includes screws for wood walls which mean if you dont have wood walls you have to go buy other screws ! i have drywall and the screws are not reliable second i bought this gate with the extension \( 24 the only one there is \) because the top of my stairs measure 44 1 2 inches this gate is supposed to fit that with the extension it doesnt i have tried for over an hour to get it to fit and it doesnt fit even with the extension it would without the extension however there is about a 5 inch gap from the wall to the bolts on each side and that is with the bolts all the way unscrewed also needless to say if i want this gate to work i have to go to my local hardware store and buy new hardware so this will mount securly or i have to take it back to the store and find something else unless i can figure out a way to make it fit how it is this gate has been a waste of my time and my money the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because im sure it would be just fine if i had wood walls and it fit to where i can install it now i have holes in my wall and confussion trying to figure out how to make it fit if its at all possible doesnt look like it is though	21
0	i bought this camera in february and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died i could review the photos i had taken but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the lcd efv and only turned off when i removed batteries i sent it to fuji repair center and got it back again almost one month later then six months later the camera did exactly same thing i have n't received my camera back yet but i'm sure never will buy a fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after i get from the repair center and at the end of the day i will have wasted almost 500 dlls	21
0	i had never read any of vernor vinges books before but i had heard he was an excellent author so i thought i would try this boy am i glad i bought it used on amazon for about only 4 i simply had no idea what was going on in this novel the plot is unintelligible i dont know what the bioweapon the jacket refers to is \? i dont know what the rabbit is i see that numerous other reviews here did not know what was going on either i do not understand how someone could write so incoherently the concept of someone who had alzheimers getting cured entering a future society is great but it never goes anywhere the only reason i did not fall asleep was that i was trying to figure out what was going on but i did could not even finish this book	21

0	there are no words to describe how awful \( ! ! ! \) this movie was from beginning to end but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day evening from being ruined the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is touched by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle need i say more \? the plot the humor the dialogues and the music are way beyond below average there is next to no nudity and there are no i mean 0 as in zero beautiful girls in this film ! as for the acting oh my the acting is beyond words school plays \( and pre school for that matter \) have better actors ! it is truly sad rent or buy \( ha ha ha \) at your own risk you have been warned !	21

0	the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case i ca n't believe the case did n't come this way and that 's just the start of the problems the dials are fussy and it 's not easy to carry this radio even in the case without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case if you have n't cut any slits in it and re tune your station in minneapolis st paul wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown but that station has howitzer power forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city granted i did n't buy this to listen to fm or shortwave it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco that wo n't happen as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins' new am radio home or any othe am signal in the area that 's really difficult to imagine being other radios i own even chintzy giveaway promotional radios can pull in most any station in the metro area if this is an example of grundig 's work i 'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products	21
1	i have been looking for a pair of docs for a while i know they are a new globalized company and i am not necessarily against that i am disappointed that you ca n't get a better range of colors i 've had a few blue pairs and a lovely green but colors are not really available now except on high tops emblazoned with the brand name an abomination for sure ! these shoes are very comfortable and apparently well made my single quibble with the black pair i got here on amazon has to do with the flimsiness of the tongue i like a nice strong tongue \( and who does n't \? \) whatever they saved on material here may have been a mistake on the other hand maybe the sole will wear out first \( or it will be a dead heat \) never thought i 'd buy shoes online but amazon and the doctor made it happen	21

0	why in the world would anyone publish a writer 's bread and butter notes to his agent \? besides the money i mean there are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor whom heinlein feels did him dirty but in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master just enjoy the stories and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published	21
0	at first i thought the idea of offering a set of the most popular applications at an affordable price was great recently however many computer makers have started using ms works as the standard pre loaded suite on new machines users who need more than very very basic features will need to buy more dependable software packages \( e g ms office \) the word processor in works for instance does not have many macrons that are commonly used in dutch scandinavian turkish romanized russian japanese etc in the end the low price of ms works is a way to save money to computer makers and to squeeze out extra money from buyers who will need to upgrade to better products anyway	21

1	so i welcome myself to the more powerful world of the cell phones i 've been a fan of sony ericsson 's phones after i 've seen what they really do and when i had the z500a long time back when i won the phone during hurricane season i thought the phone was great my only thoughts were that despite the phone being a flip phone and having a music player that the phone only had 15mb of space to begin with and to top it off its camera was n't great thanks sony for your answer i have already made a few quick station buttons on the w710 and the best part is that i feel original with the fact that i'm the only one that has it in my school and among my friends most people i 've seen the only chance they have is getting the w810 and while that phone looks ok the w710 just fits me right the phone 's color scheme the style of the phone the phone 's technogeekness \( for those of us who love technology \) and the fact that many people \( namely the girls \) find it a cute phone \( do n't know weather that is good or not but at least it attracts some attention \) the fact that the phone 's user interface is for the most part the same as every phone from se it makes it that much easier to learn the phone 's buttons and it is a huge upgrade from my old z500 with 2gb of expanded memory that i put in it and the phone 's already 17mb of internal space the phone has many possibilities ! and the last part before i go is that with the fact its an active phone you can be sure to check how many steps you do during the day check your training and more ! it even gives you rewards for being active so for those needing a nice looking phone want walkman power for mp3 's and fm radio knowing your fitness activity this is the phone for you	21

0	this magazine is not for the average car buyer they might as well call this the robb report they only test highend cars and the best ones are the ones that go 0 60mph the quickest not ride nice or get good mpg	21
0	who would give the green light to this \? it is a total remake of the 1968 classic the only difference is that there is a slight revamp to reflect modern times since it mirrors the original then it deserves what the biggest complaint hsould be of it it pales in comparison to the original this was really weird to remake this movie dawn of the dead was cool b c it had a new fresh spin to the story this has no scares no atmosphere no innovations and no riveting performances skip this one	21
0	i have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational recently i have subscribed to shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks ! ! ! !	21

1	i'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads \( about 10 20 of them \) that was before now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless	21
1	having only owned fossil watches prior to this one i must say that i was a little jaded my latest fossil bit the dust after many long good years of use i happened to find this just browsing one day and was hooked by the color and overall design i have to say i was highly impressed with what i received it is an absolutely beautiful watch	21
1	my expertise actually is in rpg 's but i 've always been a madden fan so i think my opinion can be usefull to someone wanting to know about this game this is your classic madden game very fun very addictive and very challenging franchise mode is the best feature basically you pick your team and then you decide how much to pay the players in order to keep under the salary cap which players to dump and rehire and pretty much everything else it takes to run a team \( which is a lot of things \) then their is the online mode where you play players from all over the country after you play all of the other modes this feature can keep you entertained clear until the next madden game comes out the only problem is that some online players know how to cheat ea sports strongly denies that it 's possible to cheat online and many good players get mad when someone talks about cheaters online because the good players think that people who blame other 's for cheating are just sore losers \( which is true a lot of the time \) however after personally seeing some of the things my computer nerd brother can hack into and do i think anything is possible on any website there are a ton of people out there that are a lot smarter than you and me and they can figure out how to cheat at anything ! finally the only reason that made me drop my rating from a 5 star overall to a 3 star overall the infamously not so popular superstar mode super star mode sucks ! ! ! ! you have to retry foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr to get the pedigree parents you want on top of that you ca n't fully get your player to a high rating in all the categories that make a good player \( speed agility strenth etc \) you can improve the player 's stats but never to where you eventually want to get them also when you finally get an agent that get 's you access to the performance institute it does n't do much good because using the performance institue only increases your stat 's temporarily but i have some good news ! i 've heard through the grapevine that in madden 07 this feature will be greatly improved you 'll be able to run the 40 yard dash so you can acually get a speed rating higher than a lousy 88 you get to do the bench rep to decide your own strength so at least in madden 07 you 'll have more control of your player 's skills this is the best thing about madden the people who make these madden games must have took notes when they learned about evolution in school every year madden adapts and improves the flaws in last year 's game \( much like what football coaches do with their team 's in real life \) the cool thing is that they actually take advice from their fanbase \( unlike most game companies \) when madden comes across a problem they adapt and fix the problem this game probably deserved a 4 star overall rating instead of a 3 star overall rating but when a video game company adds a new feature to a game it better be cool because it really pisses me off if they go through the trouble to add a new feature to get us all really excited and then the new feature ends up beeing stupid	21

1	for the price and relative ease of use this is a decent starter net the five foot height width makes it a little small for older youth it is easy to fold carry and store which is a huge plus especially compared to other so called portable nets it deploys fairly easily enough though the support pole set up is not completely intuitive the set i puchased had no instructions so it was n't until after several uses that i completely figured it out all in all however i am pleased with it and would buy another should the need arise	21
1	bought these for my 7 year old per his request the size was right the style was right and he has been wearing them everyday since they arrived quicker than anticipated and we are very happy with the purchase	21
0	a french saying goes the more things change the more they stay the same it appears that the historical epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that poetic license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith 's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth firstly we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina secondly the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to purify the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is preserve the aryan race modern science using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60 000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well like it or not we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie yes this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content \? this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks every single good thing about this movie would have been discovered invented with or without d w eventually and very probably very soon after every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later talented directors of the time the overall lies attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie 's great hall of fame they say that racists are not born but bred this is why i'm not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here his father was considered a hero of the confederate army where he served as a colonel i'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it 's quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn 's overtures over and over again in conclusion the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it 's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors' world view \? also do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that 's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message \? like i said before none of the techniques that this film claims to have discovered are earth shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good d w griffith 's legacy mess	21
0	i was looking for a book to make elegant simple and practical bags this book has is all feathers and beads nothing that i would ever give to someone as a gift ! i was very disappointed	21
1	this camera is very similar to the fuji f30 but has face detection \( fd \) that autofocuses on faces in a photo great for taking pictures of yourself or for snapshots you do n't have time to compose excellent quality photos in dim light at 3200 iso photos are washed out and noisy but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss option to limit iso to 1600 or to 400 camera will use any speed up to the limit 400 iso is extremely good as good as my canon digital rebel xti usual modes i never use \( flower landscape etc \) but one unique mode i use all the time no flash flash the camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 iso and then takes a picture with flash immediately after usually takes less than one second to capture both images no flash does n't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot while the following flash guarantees you 'll get the image even if the warm glow of candlelight is ruined i always have the camera set to this mode uses xd cards which i hate but if you buy a 1 gb card you 'll be able to take 400 500 photos without ever needing to change the card also battery life is unbelieveable ! fully charge the camera over several hours and you 'll be able to take 400 photos half with flash before the battery is drained fuji brand underwater housing is optional watertight to 40m \( 121 ft \) camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non blue colours and still keep the intense blue of the water literally every diver should have one of these cameras i recommend this camera without hesitation there simply is n't anything else like it on the market	21
0	i live in the wash dc area and we have pretty bad traffic i normally take a route that is n't extremely bad but does has congestion i get no warnings at all also recently there was a smaller side road \( non highway but well used road \) that was closed on both directions but had no information on this road the antenna works but clear channels traffic information sucks sucks really bad when i check the traffic information the only information i get is the main large interstate highways do yourself a favor and do n't buy this who knows maybe the xm traffic service is better but i can honestly tell you clear channel traffic service sucks ! maybe i 'll get some traffic information traveling on i 95 somewhere sorry for the unproffesionalism but its the honest truth	21

1	harper 's has been in business since 1850 and has published some of the greatest american writers from mark twain on down its editor and tone setter is the veteran journalist lewis lapham it publishes fiction and articles including interesting symposia on many aspects of american economic political and cultural life it attracts the big names in all areas and also provides a lot of human interest material statistical curiosities historical information and stories for some reason which i do not fully understand it has never been my great favorite and in the old days i preferred 'the atlantic' and the 'saturday review of literature ' to it of course one of the features of 'harper 's is its book reviews done by among others today john leonard i suppose what has soured me a bit on 'harper 's' is its bias to the political left but that withstanding it still provides a rich mix of articles of high quality	21
1	having an m a in english literature as well as a b a in literature and history anytime a movie is both historical and literary well i get a bit excited to say the least i do n't wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it 's not but the writers directors producers set it against a historical backdrop nonetheless on that note this is yet another stellar title from noneother than ridley scott with that being said i enjoyed tristan and isolde almost as much as gladiator and a bit more than kingdom of heaven \( all of these by the way are ridley scott films \) notice the historical adaptations here \? while it may be true that the story of tristan and isolde was inspirational to shakespeare 's romeo and juliet as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the arthurian legend this movie is not exclusively for the high browed college types no sir good ol' red blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie this is by no means a chick flick since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense on the other hand it 's not the typical hack and slash macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story in short it should please both sexes simultaneously aside from james franco \( tristan \) i was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast sophia myles \( isolde \) is for the most part a newcomer to american audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly british films i suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the atlantic while many of the other characters were convincing in their roles no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant irish king \( who just so happens to be isolde 's father \) in short this is one of the best movies i 've seen in awhile on some levels it reminds me of king arthur just as king arthur attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary arthur guinevere and lancelot so too does ridley scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the angle and saxon kingdoms in england if you 'll recall in king arthur arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading saxons just as the roman legions were exiting britannia historians will point out that there is no evidence of saxons in england until several decades after the roman withdrawal but oh well it made for a good story here we witness the celtic britons as they are exploited by the irish across sea what \? \? \? \? the irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around \? well tristan and isolde holds true to history in this aspect namely that the celtic britons of england were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the anglo saxons this would of course have placed them in what is now wales and cornwall and this is exactly where the movie is set let 's not forget the story of saint patrick remember he was actually a romanized briton who was captured and served as a slave in ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to ireland to convert the populace to christianity it 's interesting to note that in the movie christianity is a fairly new fangled religion in ireland so no doubt ridley scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand i particulary liked king arthur and kingdom of heaven despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics critically speaking tristan and isolde has been a bit of a mixed bag as well but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics \? rent it first if you must but i suspect this one will be a keeper in your dvd library !	21

1	my boyfriend used to search online stores for the french cologne jean patou pour homme because it was the only upscale cologne he would wear \( it was awesome ! \) however it is not produced anymore and is very hard to find and very expensive he searched high and low to find a replacement and this is it ! sean john unforgivable is surprisingly good masculine but not too musky or cheap smelling now this is all my boyfriend will wear and i'm not complaining ! guys women will love how you smell when you wear this women buy this for your boyfriends husbands but only let them wear it when they 're on a date with you ! \) anyway it 's worth the cost and it 's our new favorite	21
0	i love danielle steel ! i`ve read all of her books so far but secrets was a big disappointment to me as far as i am concerned ms steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins \( some explicit parts i didn`t like at all \) simply not the danielle steel we like the story itselfs is ok \( gives the readers some insights behind the scenes of hollywood \) but some of her books i`ve read over and over again i am not going to touch secrets for a second time however	21
1	unlike any other game you 've ever played in the best possible way i am easily bored and or grossed out by the traditional racing shooting killing zombie games and this game was a refreshing change challenging enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time other reviewers have said it ends too soon but the game lets you repeat each level to beat your previous best score so if you barely beat the level you can do it over until you have totally blown it out of the water perfect for a pair of obsessive compulsives like my fianc and me he thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than i do and his 6 going on 7 year old son loves it too there is n't anything that would be inappropriate for any age but a kid younger than 6 or 7 probably would n't get it \( after he goes to bed we play the insanely gory jaws game you get to be the shark ! ! \) you might think that rolling up stuff to make a big ball would get old fast but the king of all cosmos keeps it exciting with the challenges and surprises the levels just get cooler and cooler also the music is fantastic it will have you singing along in no time na na na na na na na na katamari damashi ! it does n't even make sense but i love it ! i just ordered the second katamari game we love katamari `nuff said	21

0	with a title like 'swirl skirt ' you 'd expect the fabric to be able to well swirl but the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable plus the cut \( of the size 12 at least \) was awkward giving my tummy a bubble that was n't even there and the last thing i want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is so i do n't recommed this item	21
1	the hammock is a great choice if you like sharing it with you significant other or by yourself it 's very sturdy and comfortable even with two adults the quality of hammock is good and worth the price especially compared to other models we looked at	21
0	whenever i'm asked what is the worst movie i have ever seen i quickly respond cabin boy it is like a long meandering and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker i would describe the plot but there is none i watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline but it never came it was written by a former staff writer for david letterman which is the only conceivable reason that letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity even he later joked about how awful the movie was chris elliott plays the only character he has ever played the annoyimg dumb guy loser his limited acting talent combined with a nonsensical plot unfunny dialogue and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor truly make cabin boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss	21

0	if you 're looking to spend money on this do n't having spent my teen years holed up in my bedroom on a commodore 64 \( and being the current fan that i am \) i was really excited when i heard about this product unfortunately it stinks there are a couple of games on this contraption that are real gems the rest being mediocre at best the overall bad choice of games is n't my issue with this thing though it 's the crummy joystick control is horrible the stick is clunky and unresponsive and makes playing a real chore as someone else pointed out in their review often it does n't even respond when pushed in a certain direction i ca n't believe it 's 2006 yet these companies releasing plug n play video game contraptions ca n't even make a decent joystick ! a real letdown	21

0	i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is non existent we 're supposed to believe that the haunted passive timid character dave was an all star shortstop in high school \? the book had a great premise and good beginning but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave 's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book 's most intriguing character	21

0	if you work in a comic book store live in your mom 's basement own a lot of black candles and think that h p lovecraft wrote history books then you might like this garbage if you have a life a clue or a girlfriend then you probably will not have any use for this stuff i still ca n't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal it belongs in a category with sisters of mercy or morrisey this record is completely lacking any imagination or energy depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel i guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast this would be the thing to listen to personally i think it 's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour do n't give these jokers your money	21

1	after reading several other reviews on the web for this product i decided to place an order for one i just received the unit this week and immediately hooked it up you should set your engine size fuel type \( gas diesel hybrid \) units of measure and your fuel tank size rounded down to the nearest whole number to allow for the best accuracy in the scangauge it 's a simple installation just plug it into your vehicle 's obdii port and choose a suitable mounting location that does n't interfere with your other gauges or present a safety hazard \( velcro strips are included for no muss no fuss installation but you could devise a more permanent mount \) depending upon the parameters that your vehicle reports here are some of the things this device can show you 4 sets of trip data is stored current trip today 's trip previous day and current tank in addition fuel economy fuel used maximum coolant temperature distance maximum rpm drive time maximum speed average speed distance to empty time to empty and amount of fuel to empty the digital gauges are for fuel economy fuel rate digital speedometer tachometer manifold pressure battery voltage coolant temperature intake air temperature engine load ignition timing throttle position and open closed loop you can display any choice of 4 of these digital gauges on the gauge screen at one time and it 's easy to cycle through them not all vehicles will report every one of the above parameters through the obdii interface if the data is not available for the chosen gauge then there will be no display the final thing that this gauge is useful for is to read and reset trouble codes and your check engine or service engine soon lamp it captures the conditions present and stores them in flash memory if a trouble code is thrown so that you can review what state the various gauges were in when the trouble code triggered again i just received this item this week but did quite a bit of research on it before purchasing i am very impressed by the amount of information the scangauge makes available utilizing the data i believe i 'll be able to improve my gas mileage as i will have instant feedback on my inputs as a driver it 's fun to use too one other thing i forgot to mention is that you can program the back light to 63 different colors it comes with 7 standard colors already programmed	21

0	just like a big chunk of us right now i'm quite the sudoku addict i just ca n't put those little puzzles down ! so i have to tell you first if you have n't worked sudoku puzzles yet you are really missing out ! get your hands on some ! naturally i was excited to try out a sudoku game and race against my friends to solve the puzzles but what a disappointment ! one small board several people straining to see it everyone racing to fill in the puzzle it just does n't work the way they designed this game was to have a board which is the puzzle to be solved and number tiles that you distribute evenly amongst the players everyone rushes to fill in the puzzle and the person who uses all their number tiles first is the winner assuming the puzzle is solved correctly first of all if you have more than 2 people playing the players are n't all going to be able to see the board well some people are going to have the board upside down trying to solve it that 's rough ! talk about getting confused between 6s and 9s ! plus everyone 's hands are in the way while they 're laying their tiles which makes it really hard to see and concentrate on the puzzle next inevitably in the games i 've played someone lays a tile wrong then the whole game is thrown off the instructions say that if someone rids themselves of their tiles but placed them incorrectly then the next person to finish would win provided all their tiles are correct most likely if one person has made an error that will have caused a chain reaction and the next person 's tiles will also be placed wrong and not necessarily by fault of either of the players it could have been anyone who started the chain reaction the format just does n't work for this game my advice is to pass on this particular game perhaps a game where people were racing side by side on the same puzzle but with their own puzzle would work better	21
0	let me sum up this software total junk pinnacle will give you one free support phone call for help then 25 for the next call they give you free email support but answer everything but your problem they try and blame it on windows xp and will have you reload windows i owned studio 8 and it worked fine went to studio 9 and had a few problems upgraded to studio 9 plus and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess and crash after crash i removed it from my machine they sent me an offer of their all new 10 5 plus upgrade hollywood fx 3 of their premium packs and a hat that says studio 10 on it this said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up this program should be called crash after crash and the only thing that works is the hat if you feel the urge to waste 100 and hours of your time just buy this product look at the reviews on studio 10 and the other studio products and most only have one star out of over 100 reviews over 95 had one star i found one with 5 stars but looking at the reviewers other reviews he is obviously an employee or share holder in the company he wrote a 1 star review on a sony competative product and 5 star reviews for other pinnacle products that you would not own if 10 5 worked	21

0	there is no doubt that this tea does it 's job but the smell of it is awful i normally do n't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things but i have such an aversion to the smell of this tea it has a top note of moldy dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad the box says that it contains delicious sasparilla i do n't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all if you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it	21
1	how can you not love the twinkie \? it 's compact delicious and aerodynamic if you actually look at the ingredients twinkies are made of flour water shortening eggs sugar sound familiar \? it 's cake there are some preservatives added to increase shelf life but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat the air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie let us face facts if one were to eat slice after slice of chocolate cake baked using organic ingredients that person is going to end up in coronary bypass land just as quickly as if one gorged on twinkies twinkies like anything in moderation are just fine	21

0	do n't buy this stroller the only good thing about it is that you wo n't be sad if you leave it somewhere the restraints do n't restrain at all my one year old twins barely stay in it so when we 're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things \( not safe \) the stroller barely fits through regular door ways and i mean barely fits it does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear the adult drink cup holder snaps off when struggling to go through doors and i do n't have to describe what a mess that is i'm just lucky i do n't drink hot coffee otherwise i would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children there is no storage the saddle bags can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you do n't mind the children being able to reach this stroller is not only a nuisance it has potentially dangerous features so please do n't buy it	21

0	i purchased the waterpik na 2 gentle sinuse rinse attachment expecting it to work with the waterpik professional ultra dental water jet since that is what was advertised they don't fit in this model so don't waste your time purchasing both together ! the sinus attachments are too short so they ca n't click into the water pik the end result water leaks out and there is no pressure through the sinus attachment i had to return both items since the amazon rep could n't find any sinus attachment to work in the waterpik ultra model it 's a shame because i love the small footprint of the waterpik ultra and it comes with a lot of cool attachments hopefully waterpik will come up with something in the near future	21
1	i just watched the second half of guarding tess on tbs it 's now 11 30pm and i am writing this review when i should be in bed 1 and half hour ago nicolas cade and the old woman in the movie both turned in great performances the story was lightly funny at first but did n't really go anywhere the relationship between the fbi agent and ex first lady was strange and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation it was still weird the climax came at the end and was very entertaining for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot there is much meaning in the movie it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life i was touched by the movie thank you i should go to bed now	21
1	here 's an epic movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid 1960s such as dr zhivago and lawrence of arabia interesting to note that omar sharif was in this modern day movie and dr zhivago several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because thanks to the previews they thought it would be an action packed adventure story such as the mummy well it was n't and it was way too slow for them frankly i thought the slow parts were the best and overall thought the film had just the right amount of action instead of overdoing it as the recent mummy pictures did another big plus was the cinematography this is a beautifully filmed movie stunning in some parts another good point is the language hardly a swear word on the negative side there was the usual political correctness a la dances with wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at wounded knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys the horse race had some credibility problems too as hidalgo came back from the dead not once but twice to race like secretariat ! anyway if you are looking for a modern day adventure story with old fashioned storytelling and no language problems this film is for you and the rest of the family	21
1	this table is so easy to assemble and is very lightweight for travel we go airplane camping in a piper super cub so lightweight compact and sturdy is a must for us it comes in a handy travel bag it 's a great table at a great price	21
0	yes it does provide a bit more eye relief and can make it easier to see the whole frame \( by making it smaller \) but there is a major problem with this the eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you this is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses	21
0	unlike many people it seems i 've never had a problem with the hinge on this waffle maker it 's still sturdy for me after about 8 uses however the fact that i 've owned this item for nearly 2 years and only used it 8 times speaks for itself this waffle maker produces extremely mediocre waffles i 've never been able to make waffles that come even close to waffles i 've had in restaurants after trying over half a dozen different recipes i realized that it was n't my ingredients it was the waffle maker this waffle maker is simply incapable of producing waffles the way they should be crispy on the outside chewy and moist on the outside instead no matter what recipe i used or how long i cooked the waffles for i would end up with dark brown waffles that were dry throughout and lost all crispiness \( if they had any to begin with ! \) within moments of leaving the waffle maker the model does n't burn the waffles the nonstick coating does indeed prevent sticking and overall the waffle maker is nice looking but that 's all it has going for it i 've learned my lesson by now that when it comes to small kitchen appliances you get what you pay for	21

1	i find turbo tax to be the original and best income tax preparation program i really saddened to hear people knock it on here because they felt cheated that this version does n't come with state tax features well if you are going to shop online you 'd better learn to read the specifications for products ! i came to amazon precisely because i knew i 'd be able to find what i needed for less texas has no state income tax so i make sure that i buy turbo tax for federal only thanks for letting me get that little rant off my chest	21
1	it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff i use it every week to take drinks to sport events it 's easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes	21
1	this magazine is fun and upbeat the pictures are bright and colorful but more importantly they add to the text if the text is about cooking a steak for example the pictures will be clear and easy to understand and will fully document what the text is saying there are many many recipes one section actually has a pull out shopping list and menus for a week a great magazine well worth the money	21
1	worth more than the price tag beautiful and elegant you will be very pleased	21
0	i was thoroughly disappointed the first few words i looked up in the thesaurus were not listed words like upholstery ! when i went online to see what i might be able to glean from their online site first fogware had not sent me a coupon then i had to deal with bad customer service \( i am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support \) then after i finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box the online info is exactly what we have in the cd so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also ! very bad ! i am now going to go buy roget 's and check it out	21
0	we bought the petsafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much it is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 maltese this particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it wo n't work unfortunately because it 's rigid it slides up a dog 's neck very easily i have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it ca n't slide even when i can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position a shrug a shake or simply walking a few steps is all it takes this is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs is not going to work it should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member this is not a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems the dog now has another negative association to the person consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying f quall	21
0	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airsoft rifle as a christmas gift the screws were too short to attach it to his kitty kat \( a shortened m 4 \) airsoft rifle 's weaver rail yes i could go out and find screws the proper length but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job so after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size wrong the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws take a pass on airsplat the sight seems ok for the price	21

0	i 've always been a fan of roger moore 's james bond but what i 've discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his bond movies were like actually good the spy who loved me is not one of them oh sure it 's fun almost all of the bond flicks are fun but it 's basically just a kid 's movie and that 's not necessarily a good thing \( 1 \) stromberg is a lame villain yes his underwater lair is well designed but it 's silly not as silly as that ice palace in die another day but pretty silly \( 2 \) barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls she 's not an ugly woman to be sure but she was a terrible actress she sounds like she 's reading poorly from a cue card in ever single scene she 's in \( 3 \) jaws is a stupid character having metal teeth would n't actually make you capable of biting through metal the metal you were biting would resist and you 'd end up just tearing up your gums i do n't expect realism from 007 movies but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic \( that said jaws is effectively used and richard kiel was excellent in the role \) \( 4 \) the disco score is terrible terrible \( 5 \) the plot is nothing more than a rehash of you only live twice but on the ocean rather than in space certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies ! embarrassing i love bond but this is not one of the highlights the dvd is good with a couple of fine documentaries but the commentary track grates because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did even if that were true it 'd be annoying	21
1	after growing up in africa one becomes rather fond of rooibos tea and i never thought the day would arrive when i would recommend anything but a pure rooibos tea tazo has taken rooibos tea to a new level by blending african rooibos \( red bush \) with hibiscus lemon myrtle lemon verbena orange peel rosemary and lemon balm rooibos has quite a distinctive fragrance that reminds me a bit of a fragrant flowers waving in a warm afternoon breeze after an african veld fire i remember mixing in a tablespoon of condensed milk as a child now i mix in powdered milk and honey honey seems to bring out the rich flavors in this particular tea blend for some reason this blend is rather delicious with a toasted and buttered cinnamon raisin bagel i 've recently rediscovered the health benefits of rooibos although i can truly say i 've been drinking this tea for most of my existence on this planet rooibos is naturally sweet very aromatic and is high in magnesium calcium iron and copper mothers in africa will often add an infusion of this tea to a bottle of milk for babies to cure colic an application of cold rooibos tea can also aid in clearing the skin or is recommended for allergies indigestion insomnia and nervous tension just drinking the tea seems to improve your skin due to the high antioxidant levels 50 times that of green tea ! this is one of the tazo teas that should not be steeped for too long because of all the delicate flavors if you enjoy this tea you might also want to try tazo honeybush tea i must say that the tazo company really has my attention with their packaging amusing tales of ancient tazo wheels and they know how to blend tea to absolute perfection therebeccareview com	21
0	this cd is without a doubt amazing stars are lost because prior to recording you would think the guitarist would invest in a damn noise gate for his guitar rig his tone is crushing sounds perfect but the second he stops playing every time ssssqqqqqquuuueeeaaaalllll it 's annoying to the point of only being able to tolerate so many songs at once because it is a chronic problem in every song	21
1	love this movie ! ca n't decide which version i like better this one or the one with grace kelly and bing crosby ! both are great	21
1	i got this yesterday for my daughters \( 3 6 years old \) and they like it very much let 's see how long that lasts the space is kind of cramped but both of them fit in there with a few dolls so i would n't complain about that setting it up was pretty easy and although it has almost no stability \( it gets toppled every couple of minutes or so \) that does n't seem to take away the fun from it however there were a couple of surprises for me a \) the product i got is very different from the picture in the advertisement it is still shaped like a castle and has the disney princesses and all but it is just different i am not complaining my girls like it a lot b \) as i said before setting it up was fairly easy \( just keep your face away as you take it out of the box for it will spring out on you very fast \) but trying to disassemble it and putting it away is a completely different story for that you have to remove 4 rods \( which were not so easy to insert in the first place \) and then you have to fold the thing away twisting it in a way that only experienced snake handlers would be expected of being able to do so \( i do n't care how easy it should be according to the instructions \) i tried it for about 20 minutes until i gave up and if you do n't keep the box this thing came in just forget about storing it folded it would be like trying to keep a jack in the box compressed without the box think about it so if you do n't mind adding this to the permanent decor of your house go for it your girls will probably like it	21

0	if like myself you have many dx and vst plug ins installed on your system then audition 2 0 is definitely not the choice with you somehow the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd party plugs such as waves diamond bundle oddly enough this was not a problem in earlier editions of audition or its former incarnation cooledit but now audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many vst and dx plugs \( except of course the ones made by adobe themselves \) bottom line \? this software is crap absolute crap if you 're serious about audio production go with wavelab heck even free multitrack audio software like kristal works better than this if for some reason you absolutely need audition then go with an earlier more stable version such as 1 5 2 0 is about as useful as a football bat	21

0	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter	21
1	its tough to beat the price of these 1 2 ct diamonds for 199 they looked really good and the wife loved them the only reason i gave 4 stars is because they only have non screw backs and they did n't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got but for the price a minor quibble you wo n't be disappointed with your purchase	21

0	there are some good things about this film it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the nazi propaganda machine was for one thing it also shows the main character antoine moreau a \( fictional \) famous french mime having his eyes opened to the reality of the nazis' 'final solution' to the 'jewish problem' brought to a czech town that has been 'given to the jews' by the nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the swiss red cross delegation hopefully persuading them that the germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed moreau changes his original idea for the performance hoping to get a 'silent' message to the red cross that will let them know the true fate of jews \( and other 'undesirables' \) at the hands of the nazis i 'll briefly mention a couple of less than positive observations and then get into my main problem with the film the production values reminded me a bit of a made for tv movie and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture the image quality on the dvd could have been much better as well also the shanachie dvd release is version of the film that has been dubbed with english this is in the case of this film not very well done the cabaret singer for instance comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice does n't match her face or ethnicity in the least everyone in the film winds up with an english accent which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children stella \( portrayed by linda jablonska \) her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl she develops a bit of a crush on antoine which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show with her as one of the leads who is kind and supportive and friendly to her who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect the problem i had was with one scene in particular stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police she bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence in the process of getting away she gets muddy scrapes herself bloody in a few places and tears her clothing she goes to moreau 's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window when he opens it he is shocked at her condition lets her into the room and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes asking what had happened he then draws a bath for her so she can wash herself as moreau sits down still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her she steps into the bath just before she pulls her dress over her head she says to him `no looking ' he shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `of course' then repairs to the adjoining bedroom where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy a moment later he hears a noise and looks up to see stella emerge from the bathroom completely naked in a full frontal nude shot moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers suggesting that she warm herself she climbs into the bed he covers her up and steps away to the other side of the room there is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred he has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy this shot only lasts a few seconds but i feel that regardless of the director 's reasoning for shooting it in the first place it could have been left out if the point was to show that moreau has either had morals all along or that he has acquired them it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways earlier in the film stella had witnessed one of her caregivers semi nude in moreau 's hotel room \( stella saw this from outside \) given her `schoolgirl crush' on moreau it seemed natural for her to become upset over this as a result however the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour this combined with the `adult' voice dubbed over stella 's makes the scene even more disquieting there are some viewers who might argue that in europe `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the us in many instances i would wholeheartedly agree with them there is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of american culture and moral values and not a little bit of neurosis however the sexual objectification of children is something about which i feel very strongly and i think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that do n't get me wrong i'm not so prudish that i turn away from even full frontal nudity in a film if it 's not gratuitous and it 's an integral part of the storyline but here it involves a prepubescent girl and could have easily been left out it worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many ca n't recognize an instance where it 's not only unnecessary but potentially harmful \? i'm glad i 've seen the film and i 'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations as noted above with all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the holocaust never happened i think it 's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen the czech film all my loved ones is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves seek it out n b this is the second time i have posted this exact review i noticed today \( 6 april 2006 \) that it has for some reason been removed from the site i 've re read what i 've written and i do n't see anything objectionable or offensive the issues i have with the film are discussed straightforwardly if anyone objects to anything i 've written here i 'd like to know what it is	21

0	i made the mistake of ordering this camera to substitute buying a pro camera the color and noise was terrible if you want a great point and shoot camera get the canon powershot s50 while they are still available the camera has pro features it was so good they stopped making it because it should have been in the pro camera line at a much higher price tag if you want to see s50 pictures go to and search my gallery cathreen styles all most all of the pictures in the gallery were taken with the s50 i am going to buy another just to have when mine breaks by the way i did end up buy a pro camera mainly because of the look i got the canon 30d and love it	21
1	it is a simple device and it is easy to imagine enhancements that would improve it yet it is as advertised and does just what i wanted it to do it sits in a shallow cardboard box between the seats of my old nissan where it is perfectly level and will not shift around while i'm driving so i set it up just before i leave for work i work close to my home so my morning commute is about ten minutes about the time it takes the wagan to brew my coffee a larger cup with a brew through lid would make it safer for use while the car is in motion which the manufacturer recommends against still i am very happy with it and have no complaints	21

1	this town feels so typical at first the suburban couple husband with misc job and wife who 's good at parties the gem in cheever 's writing is to render these people and their neighbors with the true unique humanity and quirks we all possess sometimes cheever 's work can seem stereotypical everyone drinking gin and having weird suicidal urges this book though is a masterful blend of truly normal people and the creepy backstory that lives next door	21

0	i'm not a huge fan of this phone i got it because i needed a new phone it was only 40 bucks and it 's pink 1 the battery life on this phone is terrible t e r r i b l e yesterday after charging the phone the entire night took it off the charger about 8am for work i made a 5 minute phone call a 6 minute phone call entered a number into my contacts entered an event into my calendar received a text message and made a 3 minute phone call and the phone started bleeping low battery ! ! ! ! ! 2 the ringtones are sooooooo crappy remember the ringtones on cell phones 10 years ago \? that 's what is here 3 the date and time do n't continuously display on the outside screen i do n't have a clock in my office \( i have a very small office and work for a non profit \) and i do n't wear a watch i'm constantly opening my phone to see the time it 's ridiculous 4 the battery life is terrible the good thing about this phone so far great reception i hear people very clearly for the 6 minutes i am able to speak to them before the battery goes dead if you want a cute sy phone and you speak for less than 10 minutes a day this is a great phone otherwise get something else	21

0	i have been a subscriber for 15 years and still enjoy the magazine no its not the best magazine for music but it is one of the best for for general pop culture news and i still occassionally find new artists because of the magazine though i tend to find more new movies now however if you ever have a problem with customer service forget it i never got my copy of the 1 000 issue and when i asked for a replacement i was told they were out of that issue but would extend my subscription by one issue i pointed out that it was a double issue and that they are still selling back issues on their web site for 20 if they do n't resolve it quick i might just cancel my subscription i'm so disgusted	21
1	i was thinking about purchasing all four of these movies but to have them together in a box set is a beautiful thing i will not bore you with the reviews of these movies those who love akira kurosawa movies sees the stories closely matching those of shakespeare a clint eastwood western and star wars for the price and what you get it 's a steal	21
1	pros compact lightweight portability easy to use big screen good reproductioncons microphone sensitive to wind getting used to not having a viewfinder bad low light performance summary i picked this camera as an upgrade for my old canon zr10 the first reason i chose it was the small size and portability with a good light conditions this little beast do its best shots but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me \( specially compared with mi old zr10 \) please do n't buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution the included handycam station have all the ports \( firewire usb power video \) you need to conect it the big touch screen is a must because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls \( besides some of them in the edge of the screen \) you can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini dv format	21
1	i bought these after buying tdk for the past 5 years and now only being able to get memorex at a low price \( i 've had very bad experiences with memorex cdrs in the past \) these were surprisingly cheap as verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands not surprisingly the discs lived up to expectations on my plextor 716a drive i have n't tested a whole lot yet but the ones i did test burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run there were no errors you really ca n't go wrong with verbatim just buy them	21
0	this is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old not 8 11 as it states talk about a waste of money i returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the christmas tree this year it was a shame the description was n't more accurate because i was not refunded my expedited shipping costs i paid for this toy thumbs dow	21
1	they do n't collapse so they are n't the most easily portable as you sure are n't putting them in your pocket you also are n't listening to music in bed with them as mentioned in other reviews the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears i tend to collect lower end headphones and why not so i do have a unique perspective on them \( or so i say mostly to flatter myself \) these compared to other vertical designs are good the sound is better than most not quite as good as the sony h ear line but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks these p9 's are simple one piece and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear the volume adjustment makes them nice for tv and computer use also if you ever listen while using a splitter make sure the other person is wearing the cans \( or whatever more power consumptiony headphones \) so you can cut your volume my wife wears cans when watching tv so when i just must watch some witty sonic commercial i just plug myself in they are n't perfect i 'd like to also try the sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the sony folding ones they did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my rio carbon was broken \( only volume control on the thing \) for reference my everyday buds are sony ed21lps which i highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out and can be stored in a very small area heck i even use the stupid pouch that comes with them but yeah knowing the weaknesses of the p9 if you think you 'd like it then you 'll love it	21
1	i ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card the box while attractive at first glance is flimsy got slightly crushed in transit and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted on the card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully and the message inside is not centered making it impossible to trim down said message inside appears to have been written in plain old times new roman script i could do far better on my own printer and for the cost i could get a much more attractive card at a store i will say however that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos i might order from silver insanity again but i'm not paying for any of the frills they just are n't putting enough work into it to make it worth it	21
0	no way to change the inputs on your tv the dvd functions and the tv functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a tv button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on off the tv or the xbox and if things could n't get any dumber if you press the eject button while the remote is in tv mode it does n't work the eject button is only designed to work with the xbox yet it is disabled when in tv mode \? there is also no option to program a receiver as many others mentioned this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage	21

0	if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment this is n't for you the radio is hard to use since it does n't have any indication of what frequency you are on and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static the pedometer function is marginal at best but its what you would expect for 15	21
1	i use these beans in a jura capresso superautomatic everyone in our house likes the coffee because it has a refined taste many coffees sold taste rather muddy so if you like a clear tasting coffee with delicate notes give this one a try also has excellent crema	21

1	i liked this charger so much that i ended up ordering a second unit premium solid performance in addition to 3 years warranty ! i called lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what they sent me another charger without hussle ! the call took about 2 minute and the replacement part was already on its way they definetly stand by and back up their warranty no problems with the second unit and if i ever need another one i would still buy a lenmar the two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar ppro h batteries one can use the slot number 1 and 4 for regular nimh batteries it charges regular high capacity batteries to an 80 level in less than 15 minutes and the other ppro h batteries in about 7 8 minutes i did n't notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the ppro h batteries but the ppro h kind are more durable this charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage 110 240 v and the first to use neotherm charging technology ! it 's solid and heavy duty charger not like the cheap kind that are everywhere i went through lots of sony chargers but you know what \? they will never see my money again ! the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot i have been using the msc815 since october 2005 almost daily and never once i had an issue with it	21
0	my son received this as a christmas gift he and his brother and dad were excited got all set up to build it and got nothing but frustration ! these are really mechanically minded guys too very disappointing i was especially surprised because of the smithsonian name on it you 'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it my guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled the screws stripped and we did n't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue it simply would not assemble the way it was advertised i am calling amazon tomorrow about a refund	21
1	i have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30 40 times they are very comfortable for me though comfort is highly variable for each person the material is light weight but appears of good quality and i do not detect any deterioriation at first i was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine i will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles about the same time as i purchased these boxers i purchased a couple pair of faconnable boxers at about twice the price with similarly light weight material one pair of these ripped recently my experience is the ck material is holding up better than the facconable that costs twice as much i doubt these will elicit much commentary from significant or potentially significant others	21
0	this was a film i was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects as far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment the acting was good but robin williams did not receive as much screen time as ewen mcgreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been but the major problem was the story yes it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak boring at times and just silly i would recommend ice age or garfiled the movie rather than this film	21
1	great taste excellent spicy flavor \( with or without meat added \) one of the best dried packaged soups ever	21
0	although easy to load a smart card this viewer was disappointing in quality my pictures look fine on my computer but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc \( although i found that it the picture could be adjusted it was never mentioned in the manual \) the manual is because of the comment above disgustingly incomplete if not going through the bother of returning it through amazon because i purchased it on line i would not have kept it i actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse otherwise i would have given it only one star i could have purchased a unit a circuit city or bestbuy and been better off	21
0	i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about frankly the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story any future coverage is designed to prove time 's initial position correct the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories we told you so we told you so even worse the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story ca n't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn \? out of sight out of mind is the mantra in fact i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media newspapers are failing television news ca n't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis neutrality is dead frankly i do n't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states no more iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page african states are making vast strides towards democracy we get an article about nigerian computer fraud russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq japan one of the world 's most influential cultures in the week i originally wrote this review \( see 12 month subscription \) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein 's puerile take on pornography and social deviants but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks how in the hell did our world become boring \? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer \? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in depth coverage educate the reader about the world in which we live do n't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week time has the history and potential of being a five star magazine if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news	21

0	i was very gung ho when i found out that disney was finally releasing the davy crockett tv show on dvd i grew up watching the two davy crockett movies however upon actually seeing these dvds i was very disappointed it is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes the episodes davy crockett indian fighter davy crockett goes to congress and davy crockett at the alamo are all the parts included in the movie davy crockett king of the wild frontier the episodes davy crockett 's keelboat race davy crockett and the river pirates were what made up the movie davy crockett and the river pirates i for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc the only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy leonard maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector 's box the biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between 37 100 whereas you can buy the two movies on dvd for 14 16 i myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately	21

1	this is the most amazing knife i have ever owned ! i ve purchased henckles twinstars sabatier which is pure junk ! out of all the knives ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives i enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives i have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all global this is quite a bold move as i consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where i must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know i do not want to live without i simply cannot quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and henckles twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a pandora 's box of spending it actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other i must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the excaliber of knives	21

0	the cd is great ! ! ! the legendary johnny cash comes thru loud and clear on this cd however it took amazon over 30 days to deliver this item and that was only after numerous emails to them their attitude of just wait a few more days and email us again was both insulting and annoying thank goodness this was n't a christmas gift for someone	21

1	i give this 5 stars because the price was right for a name brand it works it is no better or worse than any other grille brushes that i 've used	21
1	works great i purchase 3 one for my husband and 2 more for my children good design however it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a blackberry an ipod and a gameboy the station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time	21
0	contains 50 percent more caffeine than other gourmet coffees this is because it is not arabica beans which are the beans of quality coffee brewing it is rubusta the cheap mostly vietnamese filler coffee mostly found ihn supermarket blends such as folgers maxwell house etc the flavor of burnt twigs but you get more caffeine that 's pretty much robusta i guess it 's ok since most people who go into starbucks ask for vanilla caramel almond suger drinks rather than caring about the coffee or is it because they 've never been told that there is big flavor a difference between arabica and robusta and they incorrectly believe that if they order without all of the suger flavoring they 'd taste folgers \( or shock \) \? if you like coffee good coffee stick to arabicas if you like good coffee flavor and also lke more caffeine then just find a lighter roast of arabicas if all you want is caffeine you 'll look smarter if you avoid the markeing silliness of shock and buy nodoze	21
0	ok so this is the 2nd philosophy product that i 've tried and felt the need to write a review on i have to say this product is far below expectations i sprayed in on and the only thing you smell is the alcohol there seems to be no other notes to it even after you let it settle all you can pick up is alcohol definitely not recommending this product	21
0	we tried these after getting one of the portable mats that did n't work out this item too did n't work for us it wo n't stick it there is a table cloth then 9 time out of 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up with one hand ! it really ended up being more trouble than it was worth we started carrying a package of cleaning wipes in her bag we wipe down her part of the table really well and let her have at it at 14 months she does n't really make too much of a mess and if she does we just had an extra couple of bucks for a tip and apologize for the mess on the way out	21

1	i concur with the review that points up the problems with adobe 's new license manager method of activation when you pay as much as you do for this app or the entire suite you should not be faced with complete lockup should you have hardware problems or ca n't connect to the internet from location shooting i took one star off for this egregious marketing tactic that said this version of photoshop is superb an otherwise 5 star app if you take the time to use the tutorials included in the help \( used to be separate folders with chapters 1 4 of the classroom in a book but no more alas \) or get one of deke mcclelland 's fine tomes and do all the lessons there is nothing in this app that the novice ca n't start to use from day one with today 's point shoot cameras packing more resolution and more manual control into their functions use of photoshop becomes more than just a hobby you can really rescue photos that are too dark too bright exceedingly color shifted from the cut folder and still make prints further the camera raw functionality allows anyone with a sufficiently functional digicam to touch up snapshots into fine photography a warning you need the fastest processor you can afford \( a core duo or quatro will be superb \) and as much ram as your system can take there is an optional performance plug in which maximizes performance on systems with more than 1 gigabyte of ram you need at least that much under windows xp to get good performance out of ps cs2 if you can use 2gb or more dual channel memory that 's even better \( the dual channel ram adds a small boost when handling large file sizes e g camera raw image sources \) if you do n't have these do n't expect photoshop to act fast adobe bridge is a major improvement for this version it offers superior file and image management functions and can even do batch editing on images you can even perform camera raw adjustments right from bridge bridge can perform batch processes while you edit in photoshop if that is n't cool i do n't know what is if you doubt me check out deke mcclelland 's photoshop cs2 one on one tutorial for his chapter on using adobe bridge his video introduction \( included on a dvd in the book \) and chapter on using and customizing bridge are terrific introductions if you 're a user of versions 5 x \( as i was \) 6 or 7 upgrading to cs2 is a no brainer do n't wait get it now before the adobe license manager gets worse in 2007	21
0	i 've been using this remote since it was released better than any others i 've run into but when it gets a glitch which all software driven devices are susceptible too be prepared to give up a couple of hours when it 's working it 's a 5 star device however read on as to why i give it a 2 as i type this my hold time is up to 45 minutes on the phone to 2nd level support 3rd call today i simply got a new pvr programmed ok but it is n't the default device when i watch tv also it took two calls to find out my directv pvr is not a pvr it 's a satellite as a pvr it could n't be added to activities because you do n't have a device that will change channels news to me never known a pvr that could n't change channels literally 4 friggin' hours so far and it still not right at some point the tv suddenly stopped turning on 2 3 hours on that issue and it 's still not right tv does not go on until i hit the help button on the remote to add insult to injury i ca n't access the website enter my email as an id and am told it 's already in the database i ask for a password reminder via email and get a message that my email address is not recognized i hate that the software does n't have a simple home button you have to go through several menus to get back to it hold time now up to 52 minutes i have to hang up for an appt so the hold has to be repeated again oh yeah i also dislike the size of the buttons especially the numbers cell phone sized no doubt designed for a dainty child i could go on but if another comes out with a product like this one i 'll be looking hard at it	21
1	we have an aussie healer mix \( we think she was a foundling \) with a thick soft coat i 've had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at 60 to 75 a pop so last summer i decided to try it myself with this clipper kit to make a long story short she did n't turn out so bad ! \( well the neighbors did n't laugh anyway ! \) it took me a while to get the hang of it i finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers but she did n't complain and i had a cool dog for much less than a pro cut the best part was i could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back no report as yet how long the blades last but i'm already money ahead even if i must replace them next year	21
1	if you have pets and are constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner then you will love this one i bought this vacuum as a supplement to my large \( and heavy \) canister vacuum and have been pleasantly surprised by its ability to pick up pet hair because of the small bagless chamber you have to empty it frequently so i would n't count on this vacuum as my only vacuum cleaner i wanted a lightweight vacuum to use on my hardwood floors and area rugs specifically to pick up pet hair and this vacuum exceeded my expectations i tried the shark a similar model made by fantom and another cordless vacuum and not one of them worked anywhere near as well as this one does \( stay away from the fantom cordless by far the worst ! ! \) i do n't think any cordless vacuum will have enough power to pick up pet hair like this one did overall this vacuum is a great little vacuum for quick clean ups or to maintain pet hair free area rugs one suggestion use the carpet setting even on bare floors the brushes are high enough so they wo n't scratch bare floors but the cleaning capability is much less without the rolling brush i found that it just rolled over the dog hair without picking it up unless i used the carpet setting the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying	21
1	in my 1 3 2007 review of the harry potter dvd series i said about alfonso cuar n 's direction of harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban that perhaps cuar n held back from doing his own thing because chris columbus had directed the previous harry potter releases and had oversight to azkaban well the notion that cuar n was holding back in his potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing children of men cuar n can indeed make a great movie and could have made azkaban great but it was just good greatness clearly shines through when cuar n is turned loose with his own film and children of men is a good example children of men is full of social and political themes as well as an abundance of messages of faith and this is apparently what cuar n does best \( see 2001 directorial of oscar nominated y tu mam tambi n \) in children of men almost 20 years have passed since the last human baby was born the result \? chaos clearly the end of the world is near zombies might as well have taken over the earth and it was that zombie movie \( you know the good ones like 28 days later 2002 or dawn of the dead 2004 \) desperation that i was reminded of throughout children of men cuar n adapts p d james' 1992 novel to the big screen with several liberties but keeps the message pretty much the same the story is believably told and the movie keeps an exciting pace all the way through clive owen leads the cast and this guy just gets better and better in every film that i see him in he 's supported by julianne moore michael caine and a bunch of other actors that all turn in a list performances a fair amount of action suspense a very well told story everything that you need to keep you entertained and hey did they actually keep the runtime to less than two hours for children of men \? you do n't get that too often anymore	21
1	this is a beautiful movie but please have no misconceptions about what you 're getting into it is not a traditional love story it does not have a happy ending you are taken on an incredible journey and grow to love these innocent people who burn with passion then you see terrible undeserved things happen to them but it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting it is a story about the human costs of founding a nation among many other thought provoking things it was shamefully overlooked in 1998 and i do not understand why it has not been released on dvd i appeal to fox searchlight please dvd this soon	21

1	i bought this based on the amazon reviews i am extremely new at this but the software is pretty good the teacher is somewhat annoying and as another reviewer said he sings over his playing way too much i wish there was a way to turn him way down and the guitar up it touts having over 160 lessons but that is somewhat misleading i do n't doubt it has over 160 pages but i covered 23 lessons in about an hour i do like the fact that the first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions of the chords so you do n't feel hung up on doing the full chords when your fingers do n't want to move to strange new positions they are n't used to i am using this as well as fender 's dvd for acoustic with keith wyatt the dvd is a little more challenging for me but keith wyatt is much better than the guy from the emedia software \( and he does n't feel the need to sing ! ! ! \) overall i would recommend this software	21
0	i have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and i have become very skeptical of much of its advice this advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e g the us dairy industry \( there is always at least one of those annoying got milk ads \) and not surprisingly every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products \( e g milk and cheese \) however having read many books on nutrition it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health for instance read the the china study by colin campbell an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the us dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public 's perception of the healthfulness of its products it is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks the magazine also appears to be very similar to prevention magazine which i also have subscribed to and i would make the same criticism of my advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent berkeley wellness letter that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the us dairy industry	21

1	this is a decent magazine and it 's good to support an unabashed christian magazine but if sojourners sometimes errors to the left christianity often persistently errors to the the right i subscribe to both and if i find myself agreeing with the editors of one magazine too long i dig back deeper into the bible and then come out in the right place contributor yancey is an inspiration and a true christian voice while colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasoned approach of ct	21
1	the product works fine it seems kind of strange that i had to purchase a package of 10 in order to get just the 2 that i needed the linksys unit is just attached to the bracket by pressure so i ran a long zip tie through the bracket and around the linksys units to make sure they did n't pop off	21
0	i 've got this meter a month ago i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest the meter gives a reading after several attempts but often inaccurate you have to stay still as a statue for 10 20 seconds to get a reading now i'm using it as an exercise watch stopwatch	21
1	used this for a trip from nw of chicago to houghton mi \( in the u p \) and it worked fairly well except through some hilly sections \( lost signal a few times \) this works best when you have two people \( driver and navigator \) as looking over at a laptop while driving is n't a good thing ! would have been even better with voice prompts but at the price i would n't expect it	21

0	i did n't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as i plan to use it while recovering from surgery this one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable it does the job but only just i 've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably sometimes it tracks speed distance calories time and sometimes it just wo n't come on at first it worked great also the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly not in danger of falling off or anything but just not a secure connection to the base overall the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work but i did hope for better quality	21
1	i have no kitchen stove so i have been relying on this little champ for everything from tea to pasta \( before south beach diet \) to making eggs in the morning etc i have owned this unit for over 3 years and have never once had a problem with it awesome for a college student or a person with a tiny apartment such as mine also great for taking to work it is a bit hard to clean and there is not too much area to touch to move it while it is still cooling down other than that i highly recommend it i am here today to buy the double version and i can only hope that it performs as well as it 's little sister enjoy ! ! ! li	21

1	my husband and i bought this for our new home and we 're both thrilled ! he loves that it holds our new tv and stereo system and i love the way it looks it 's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours we 're so glad we found something we could both agree on ! what a great piece of furniture !	21
1	i have had it since october and it is clearly the best phone i have ever owned it has also replaced my camera and i am now never without a camera i attend a lot of concerts where cameras are almost always prohibited they do n't give the phone a second glance not realizing it 's got the 3 2 megapixel capability i have got tons of fantastic shots from the last 4 shows after throwing in a 1gb memory stick \( i think it was 79 \? \) it is now storing a half gig of my best music and the display says it will hold 300 pics right now the movie function rocks too however you are going to want to be up very close to the subject the sound playback of the movies is fantastic though so at least concert videos make for good listening the phone works flawlessly with my pc if i throw it on the usb cable it pops up instantly as another drive just like the camera just drag on off the music and pics all pics are very nicely numbered and named if i do n't care about viewing the files and just want to move stuff on and off the phone i do n't even take it out of my pocket the bluetooth connection allows me to use their software to move things around also very cool was that it pops up on my computer as a modem which i actually was able to use immediately in my pc anywhere program in terms of being a phone yeah it 's great the contact list is easy to work with the call clarity is no issue at all good signal no dropped calls etc etc \( this is all with cingular \) speaker phone works well it needs charging about every 3rd day charges very quickly charges slower but with the usb plugged in it also charges the only thing i can think to complain about is that when using the usb cable to charge it only wants to charge it to 89 if i want 100 i have to throw it on the real charger for a few minutes	21
1	after reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my ipod i had read a lot about how it interefered with the usb cable or the hold switch but i could n't argue with the price i must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket ipod products i have puchased it does exactly what it is supposed to do protect my ipod i have no trouble opperating any of the ipod 's buttons and i simply remove the case when i charge the unit i have not found that it impairs the functionality of the ipod at all while keeping it securely around my neck it is perfect for jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites i find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion ultimately it perfectly protects my ipod when i am out and about which is what it was designed to do the reasons i gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little and i whished they had mounted the ipod right side up like they did on the nano model over all i am well please	21
1	this cd is a must have ! you cannot afford to not buy it the information is comprehensive and easy to follow the format is perfectly set up you can review a section many times if needed every family and individual in america should view this cd to know what to do when a terrorist attack occurs not if but when it occurs for instance before watching this cd i had no idea you could use regular household items like dish soap or bleach to remove radioactive materials from your skin but these items will make chemical burns worse i feel much better having this knowledge from the cd and this is just one example of the useful and critical information i learned the preparation checklists on the cd are awesome for planning ahead knowledge will be powerful in protecting yourself and your family in the event of another attack	21
1	another castlevania game means more excitement going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of castlevania has been an interesting one for many many years i love the graphics they are truly something magnificent the special effects from all the enemies is really a nice welcoming touch just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky the way a castlevania game should be this game follows the formula that was featured in symphony of the night which means if you like the metroid style of gaming you will love this game as well	21
1	i'm the type of guy who has never bothered to buy slippers i run around the house in socks i'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold plus i run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop turn on the water for a tree or plant etc things that normally require me to slip on some shoes these slippers are very soft but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry the light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however but so far i 've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such \( laugh with me \) yes i 'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up	21

1	audrey without givenchy and only a portion of her face visible few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances the depth of the movie the richness amount to a great piece of art certainly the movie is not fun but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster	21
1	the lewis hyman athens doormat is a very good product it looks good at the door and takes care of all dirt and debris from your shoes that would otherwise be brought in the house it is a beautiful addition to my home	21
1	i do n't actually own one yet but my boyfriend does so i 've been sneaking over to his house to use it until i make room in my own home for one when i first used it i was like some of the other reveiwers disappointed that it did n't work my abs the way i expected but then i realized i was n't doing it correctly it makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it ! the strap is way too small though i usually just put my fingers under it but there 's no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight and i have pretty small arms the range of motion thing is great and feels so good on the back which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground \( i used to do about 1 000 crunches a day but then i started getting bruises on my back from them and i pretty much hit a plateau where i was n't seeing any changes in my abs \) i have so much fun using the ab lounge while i watch tv too it 's a great way to make the commercial time go by i would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs it makes it so much more worth it	21
1	a very good product but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself howard rules !	21
1	i have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side the problem with most conditioners i 've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it they are very heavy and weigh my hair down i found out about kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at amazon it 's wonderful doing everything i need including making my hair nice and shiny without the heaviness i recommend it highly	21
1	i was already a fan of mike and the jacksons but when motown 25 came on in 83 this guy set the standard for what music and performance could be and where it could go till this day in my lifetime that one performance at motown 25 is the single most perfect performance i 've ever seen i remember the next day at school and the next month after that performance we had all kind of talent shows where all of the kids were trying to out moonwalk each other the saddest and funniest part was watching the less fortunate kids who could not afford the michael gear wearing tube socks with dress shoes and kids making home made glitter and rhinestone gloves hilarious as an adult i refuse to let the media and even michael himself ruin my childhood memories of this untouchable piece of music 24 years later thriller remains the album to beat	21
0	i was disappointed when i received this cd although it is original the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two by your side \( my favorite \) is good for about two minutes then the beat gets off track and starts to sound terrible if this was done on purpose i cannot fathom why i know this is lo fi but a hint of bass would n't hurt at all as it stands the cd sounds like an unfinished product and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own i think this cd would best be used for some sampling especially in today 's hip hop if you are looking for beautiful relaxing music look elsewhere	21
1	agree with the other reviewer nothing like this in the states no country kitch no traditional just straight modern clean pretty rooms homes it 's expensive that 's the part that stinks i buy it at 7 50 an issue but it 's worth it b c it 's modern there is a lot of minimalism which you very rarely see in u s magazines i keep every copy of this they are always good for reference i read them each dozens of times over	21

0	most of these songs were previously sold on other albums from martina what a waste of money to buy this album of mostly old songs and only a few new ones ! martina is sucking money out of the pockets of hard working individuals maybe she should try getting a real job instead of using the average working person to support her lavish luxurious lifestyle many of us are living in trailer parks working 80 hours a week while martina sitting on her a in her million dollar house making money like rain ! you the people who are buying her albums are making her rich what the hell is wrong with you people \? do n't buy her albums and let her get a freakin' job so she can feel what it 's like to work every day and actually earn a damn dollar ! martina quit using poor people to accommodate your ridiculously high lifestyle	21

0	warning this unit has flaws that can render it useless my intention was to share my dvi monitor with my usb keyboard and mouse between my pc and mac simple enough this unit fit the bill according to the specs however as soon as i hooked everything up per the directions the unit started beeping like crazy and would not stop i had to disconnect all the cabling to get it to stop as everyone in my office ran to my desk to see what the noise was all about alright 20 minutes googling for support lead me to the conclusion that i needed to perform firmware upgrade warning don't do it ! attempting a firmware upgrade on this unit from xp will most certainly render it a paperweight there is no fixing the unit after the firmware upgrade fails and it will under xp when i tried the update i the utility reported tramsit error note the spelling on the word transmit that is how belkin spells it in the utility if they cannot spell correctly in a vital utility such as a firmware upgrader what chance is there the code is quality \? anyway that was the kiss of death the unit was dead and had to be sent back for rma unacceptable ! i would not recommend this product to anyone it is the worst kvm ever	21
1	having only seen seinfeld 's series on tv that goes by the same name it was great to have the opportunity to see him as a stand up comedian on dvd i 'd never seen the dvd before but some of the material sounded familiar perhaps it overlaps with some of the opening and closing live gags that are shown on the seinfeld show \? you may notice that in his speel about the chinese he lets the word shovel out too soon \( when talking about the chinese 's perseverance with chopsticks \) and thus spoils the joke a little bit but seinfeld is obviously a master of ad lib so he managed to work around it a thoroughly recommendable dvd	21

1	by far and beyond the best history periodical i have come across and consistantly one of the best magazines i have read i have subscribed for three years now and that says a lot for me especially given the price since most magazines do n't keep my interest for longer than a year i find myself dropping anything i am currently reading magazines and books alike until i have finished each one easy to read and yet usually contains much detail that you can sink your teeth into the articles do a fantastic job of appealing to both the uninformed and the seasoned student of history ever have one of those teachers that would tell a story and then at the end after being rivited by the narrative you actually found you had learned something in a way that made you feel almost as if you had experienced it yourself \? well many times i find that this magazine does just that every now and then they do get a little fluffy but all in all unbeatable	21

1	my boyfriend buys this magazine and likes it a lot i also take a look at it because in addition to tastefully photographed beautiful women there are a lot of things in it that makes it very interesting even for women for example there are fresh articles about fashion cars gadgets sex and even celebrities i read them with interest and skip the models which i guess are the main entertaining element in the magazine for the guys well that 's fine i am a beautiful woman as well and my boyfriend does n't rely only on tips from such magazines to keep me very satisfied but also on bestsellers such as scientfically guaranteed male multiple orgasms and ultimate sex that 's why i do n't mind when he lists maxim and enjoys the photographed beautiful women maxim can definitely satisfy the hunger for such eye candies of every man who has a strong and happy relationship without getting in trouble overall it is a very good high quality magazine which has a lot to offer both as photographs and information and i am sure that you will enjoy each issue	21

1	given that pornography is a multi jillion dollar a year business it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often but boogie nights provides it with the sort of skewed darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves and becomes a certifiable classic in the process following the story of eddie adams a simple minded almost impossibly well endowed teenager from suburban california who achieves porn stardom as dirk diggler before turning 20 boogie nights is both a time tested star is born and almost blows it all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was paul thomas anderson 's directing is as excessive and stylish as you 'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry with anderson pulling out every trick in the book long tracking shots underwater closeups montages movie within a movie views and some moments that approach stream of consciousness \( dirk 's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example \) naturally anderson also loads the movie up with period details right down to the farah fawcett poster in teenage dirk 's room the platform shoes and the obligatory disco sequences its visual flair aside though boogie nights is also the sort of insanely quotable watch it until you 've memorized it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties \( trainspotting fargo goodfellas swingers true romance etc etc etc \) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade this movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it especially its murderer 's row of a cast burt reynolds \( jack horner \) don cheadle \( buck swope \) john c reilly \( reed rothchild \) julianne moore \( amber waves \) william h macy \( little bill \) luis guzman \( maurice rodriguez \) tom jane \( todd parker \) philip baker hall \( floyd gondolli \) philip seymour hoffman \( scotty jay \) and alfred molina \( rahad jackson \) all figure prominently and even wahlberg \( dirk himself \) and heather graham \( rollergirl \) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors that said what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like the main characters almost entirely have hopes aspirations and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession jack 's desire to be a serious filmmaker dirk 's ridiculous pseudo karate and reed 's equally ridiculous poetry buck 's goal of opening his own stereo store amber 's attempts to get back in touch with her son which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co stars helping us see them as fleshed out characters not just plot devices in the story since there is n't really a plot to speak of the movie is told as a series of episodes goodfellas style with several extended pieces the pool party at jack 's house where eddie dirk gets introduced to the whole crew the new year 's eve party celebrating the start of the '80 's the fake drug deal gone bad at a rahad 's house serving to turn the narrative in new directions this last set piece when dirk reed and todd head over to rahad 's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt deserves special mention as it 's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory it starts off almost surreal with a skinny chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and rahad \( clad only in underwear a bathrobe and slippers \) discoursing semi coherently as he sings along to not so classic 80 's songs on a mixtape from there it just gets progressively darker and tenser with the lighting acting and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as todd kicks his ill conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control molina 's over the top performance more than anything else makes the scene as he turns rahad into a manic ball of drug fuelled energy and later a shotgun toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge i would n't say molina turns in the best performance i 've ever seen in a movie but it it probably the best performance i 've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie the '80 's are of course the hangover from the joys of the previous decade as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product cocaine suddenly becomes addictive and dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one fittingly as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties the movie takes a darker turn becoming grittier more downcast and a lot more violent but no less compelling all the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present just in a decidedly less sunny form even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right the movie 's pedal to the metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away well except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end but by then i for one did n't care	21
1	like i stated in the title this is n't my favorite three in one product from philosophy i have several of their scents and i really love cinnamon buns and some of the chocolatey ones strawberry milkshake smells nice but it is very sweet i would n't say it smells artifical but it does n't smell like fresh strawberries either i have used it as a shampoo conditioner quite often and i have no issues with it i have fine hair and it did n't leave me with tangles like some of the other reviewers have complained about	21

0	i did not buy the whole set my review is for an 8 fry pan it was one of those try it deals i do not like the grooves in the pan because after for instance frying an egg the grooves retain food and if you do n't use a brush to scrub the grooves you 'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves i ca n't imagine cleaning a whole set of this cookware yikes	21
1	this is a great drink i wanted to try something that was different and this definately fit in it isnt carbonated and tastes really good what i really wanted to know though was how it worked there is no caffeine or taurine and the ingredients list didnt really show anything out of the ordinary it worked well though and i was able to stay focused for a long time after drinking it	21
0	the friend who i purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too fast for her to keep up with she is used to a two wheeled walker but wanted one with a seat she did n't keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund it turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund so she did n't return it the lesson better buy local if you 're not sure	21
1	i finally received this product in the mail after knowing about it for a year i ca n't say i'm a huge fan of deepak chopra he presents some good ideas but from what i can tell he seems to consider meditation to be more of a mechanism for mind and body control leading to bliss and relaxation rather than a tool for unbiased self knowledge to come to terms with all the things that one rather might ignore i find this bias is reflected in the game as a game in itself it is pretty good its graphics and its originality and learning to relax and chill out may be useful for some people i did n't find the process as compelling as i expected though i found i was able to learn some of the skills pretty fast and other places i seemed to get stuck one potential drawback is that if you get frustrated and try to start forcing things to happen it can defeat the purpose of meditation the science of biofeedback is fairly new and i can see its potential in the field of preventative health i just would n't put the same new age spin on things as chopra does	21
0	it was neat to be able to make cotton candy at home however the machine only makes a very small amount at a time so it is a lot of work for not much enjoyment it takes an adult to run the machine and watch over it since it gets hot then it cools for almost 10 minutes it does n't even come with the sugar needed ! the product should list it on the outside of the box sugar not included ! then you have to clean it \( adult only \) it would not buy it again this review will not mark a 1 for educational value it keeps giving it a 2 and i put a one \( fyi	21
0	i agree with the previous review the deluxe blower brush just left more dirt in the camera because the hair of the brush is falling out	21
1	this is a great camera plenty of resolution excellent shot speed sturdy frame the kit lense does n't do the camera justice buy the body separate and add a better lense on the bad side i had a small glitch with the camera 's firmware soon after purchase and had to return it for a fix it was two months before the camera was returned sorry canon you lose a star for that	21
1	in 1962 elvis was given a script that would take full advantage of his flare for comedy and fierce timing the movie was follow that dream and he would never see this oppurtunity again for the rest of his career elvis deliver 's a flawless deadpan comedic performance that is seamless from start to finish that will remind you of a young andy griffith through the innocent eyes of toby kwimper we see a different world a world not so harsh and positive to the touch in the courtroom scene that would be the climatic event of the film elvis deliver 's one of the finest speeches i have ever seen on film and there is not a dry eye in the house we see through this performance that elvis the actor needed only a suitable script and then he would keep up his end of the bargain follow that dream is a wonderful motion picture that has an endearing cast of great actors who were among the best of their time and it shows this was elvis 's crowning glory if that he had one a finer performance by elvis you will not find on film watch him shine	21
0	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	21
1	my experience with developer tri ace 's games dates back to the original playstation era with star ocean the 2nd story like most gamers on this side of the world this was probably the one of the first tri ace titles that had and created enough of a buzz to form a niche of fans the other game which is credited with a simular yet even bigger buzz was the original valkyrie profile unfortunately the yield from the initial pressing run of that game was so low \( so tri ace would n't lose to much if the game did n't sell or catch on \) by the time i had heard the hype surrounding vp and wanted to give the game a try it was much too late copies of the game were selling at astronomical prices on e bay much like how sealed copies of final fantasy vii are selling now because of this i was ecstatic when a sequel which in this case is actually a prequel was announced so i could finally experience what i had missed out on the first time in one form or another granted vp2 is not a complete carbon copy of the original but the majority of the gameplay elements cross the game generation gap so in essence this game should probably give you an idea of what the original itself was like so would i say that i was blown away or impressed by what i missed out with missing the original vp \? not really to start with the game is simply beautiful there are some dazzling effects from leaves and grass waving in the breeze to various types of weather pounding some of the locals this is what one should expect from a last generation ps2 title sure every once in a while the battle camera might clip some polygons so it looks like your characters are standing on air but that is so minor it does n't matter the only gripe i have is i wish the characters weapons changed depending on what they currently have equipped however since the character designs are so dependant on the default look of the weaponry the above simply would n't work very well combat is valkyrie 's claim to fame much like it is in other tri ace games like star ocean this is a good thing considering the amount of time you 'll spend in battle mode leveling up the game 's massive number of characters \( of which only a handful are actually involved in the story the others just seem to be there \) at a quick glance the battle system seems to be a button mashers dream but like a good 3d fighting series \( soul caliber or tekken \) those who know what their doing will always get further or have less difficulty as things can be difficult enough other combat related issues also sprout up reviving an ally requires you to be near the ally 's body and status effects are so not your friend especially when the whole party is inflicted at once \( especially with poison \) shutter as fun as combat is there are quite a few hitches to be aware of such as wasting ap on a dash and getting nowhere because your party is caught on the edge of something in the environment or when party members become separated for the same reason limiting your attack options until you take the time and go back and get them this becomes especially aggravating when you 're trying to finish battles as quickly and efficiently as possible to receive experience and crystal bonuses the change from a 2d fighting environment in vp to a 3d one in vp2 works but the above issues make you yearn for 2d battles of the original which would probably be devoid of these problems the game 's skill system is another area that initially seems interesting and clever but quickly becomes quite cumbersome you 'll form rune words with your equipment and accessories to unlock new potential skills note the word potential in the previous sentence unlocking a new skill does n't grant the character the skill automatically only though battle can the skill be used and permanently learned at first glance this is a good thing since it prevents abuse \( think ffix skill system here \) but the player then quickly finds out it may \( well usually \) take a long to learn said skill instead of being awarded a set amount of points towards your skills after an enemy defeat like in most normal rpgs a percentage earned towards potential skills based on the average level of your current party and that of the enemy \( s \) because of this you 'll constantly be seeking out stronger and stronger enemies and you 'll hardly ever find an undeniable great place to level up you 'll also be contending with the never ending equipping and unequipping of equipment while doing this and often means your party is usually far from wearing the strongest available equipment at all times something that is usually a given in most rpgs traversing dungeons is probably the most noteworthy aspect of vp2 after the battle system the first few are a complete cakewalk and teach you the ropes the later ones can really test you sanity and your brainpower correct sealstone usage and photon know how go a long way towards completely clearing them of all their contents kudos to tri ace for the awesome auto map feature features like this need to become an industry genre standard ! in the sound department motoi sakuraba makes a rather subdued yet solid entrance seeming to ditch his rather unique yet unorthodox style of composing it 's not until much later until you hear a piece and you know yeah that 's sakuraba no doubt the voice overs are good but at the same time just a few tiers above decent valkyrie profile 2 also falls victim to problems that are prevalent in other tri ace games some moments of unbalanced gameplay creep up on the player as the difficulty goes up a few notches without much warning the story is once again slow to start \( is this even a surprise anymore with tri ace games \? \) and some of the story twists you can see coming a mile away \( the one revelation at the end of chapter 3 was so freaking obvious ! \) all this said is valkyrie profile 2 worth playing if you 've never experienced vp \? yes however now having experienced it i honestly think i could have had waited for a price drop instead of buying it on day it came out despite this i still look forward to playing the re release of the original on the psp	21
1	when it comes to prepared cereals this has to be one of the best manufactured in north america in terms of value for money that it is also delicious and that it does n't go soggy as soon as you pour on the milk are two more good reasons to try and buy mesa sunrise and if you are concerned about all that other stuff mentioned described with words like organic kosher gluten free and so on then by all means enjoy the extra feelings of vindication	21

0	regardless of the quality of the magazine it is really annoying to see oprah on every single cover ! and to make it worst she does not pick regular oprah shots instead you look at every issue 's front cover and ask yourself how did they take that picture \? she does n't even look like her ! it 's as if oprah is telling all of us see how i can look like \? every month is just a new testimony from oprah that money does do wonders on the top of that oprah 's personal thoughts things favorites ideas even more pictures are all over the few pages that are not advertisement i still gave it 2 stars because from time to time you can find a good article but the bottom line is the question is this a magazine or a show off \?	21
1	anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the quot left behind quot series since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture indeed the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the reagan white house and christian or not who has n't heard of the term quot antichrist quot or the significance of the number quot 666 quot \? this book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology including the role of israel russia the arab countries europe and the united states it also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years \( turkey was considered gog and magog before russia was and the pope was designated as the antichrist for years before hitler and henry kissinger came along \) the final chapter written at the brink of the collapse of the soviet union demonstrates how once again premillenial thought adjusts itself \( or sometimes not \) depending upon world conditions this is a fair even handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon	21
0	h r block does a much better job marketing software than writing it i used the on line version had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later after about an hour of painfully slow entry sometimes just one item per page most of the time looking at loading please wait i had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save no luck repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error and i could not save without registering finally just left the computer on and left when i came back taxcut had timed out and lost all my data by the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e mail to other companies even if you select no you will get frequent e mails from h r block i will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year when a company ca n't get something simple like this right it calls into question everything they do	21
1	now let 's get its effectiveness out of the way so we can talk about that love it or hate it scent ! it is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days i have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends and it leaves my hair shiny it is n't greasy at all if you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners do n't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month that is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair \( silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in cone like dimethicone etc \) detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup so the scent it is green kind of melon and fresh with a hint of violet \( like bathos gratuitous violets and daddyo \) to it it took some getting used to and when i first got it i thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable like smell but when you use it and rinse it out you are left with a rich green scent with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet it is n't for everybody but if you buy it give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive i use it with daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent i get from it i use it in rotation with american cream which is a bit lighter	21

1	i am a big fan of this product my hair is very strong it needs a product which can keep it tamed however most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which in my opinion is a bad look for today 's fashions the matte look is more flexible american crew fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold it also smells nice not to strong and not too girly	21

1	half life made its debut in 1998 and it shocked the entire world half life at the time featured stunning graphics gameplay and sound it was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands and still to this date half life is a game that every action game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again but made it scream the game pits terrorists and counter terrorists in a fast paced sort of s w a t type of tactical firefighting gameplay matches can consist of one of two types of game types the first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal in both of the game types you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective in bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round the player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it once the bomb is planted the counter terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated the counter terrorists usually have about thirty five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round the second type of gameplay is hostage rescue the terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base if the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter terrorists nothing will happen except that now the counter terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round at the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style all of the weapons in the game are one hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality this is an element that makes counter strike such a superior game counter strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world an entire culture has formed around it so what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game \? it is purely because of the fantastically well crafted gameplay and not the graphics or the game would not be as popular as it is players around the world will give you many deep reasons why it is such a great game but one without argument stands out it is simply the fact that versus other games it is difficult to make a kill in the game what makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated it has been superiorly well done and definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically a feeling of power will be experienced when holding an ak 47 or an m4 the game is quite punishing to new players and a total hapzard to players who have never played first person shooters or video games at all but regardless the stress you feel at first there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry difficulty as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game there are over ten maps in the game and each one has been done as a masterpiece all of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment the most popular of all the maps de dust2 that has been created by davej is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies magazines shows etc due to its style and simplicity it is a godly designed map and arguably the most popular map in first person shooter history one thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps since each map has been superbly designed a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play and with a different feel the game also has many public map editors which 3rd parties can use to create custom maps fy iceworld and awp map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers this makes counter strike a game with an almost infinite value sort of feel the sound in counter strike is absolutely insanely realistic the first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of ak 47 fire or pistol fire not much is known why the guns sound so realistic and the player 's best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons the sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of power this sort of thing is extremely rare in video game at the time counter strike had simply jaw dropping graphics created all from the half life engine players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were at the present the game does n't hold the same but it is what in the past has mattered half life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics the bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at games before the release of half life hardly had any sort of physics and if they did it would be something very basic counter strike is a game that without argument should be on any player 's hard drive there are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at 1998 still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom counter strike will forever be played and is the heart of all action games from the past present and the future	21
0	i tried this swing then this fisher price 's open travel swing in both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat the jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it did n't stay closed well and the palm tree was always in the way finally i bought the fisher price aquarium swing i found the seat of the aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place \( so it wo n't fold over on baby \) and it is easier to assemble and haul around	21
1	the pan arrived on time and undamaged in the factory box the nonstick surface is slicker than the hardened titanium one used on scanpan and cleans easily the rotating vent on the glass lid is a nice feature my wife was skeptical at first but i 've caught her and my daughter using this pan frequently in fact it 's become their favorite pan ! unlike a pure teflon finish this pan will brown the food nicely as far as durability goes well it 's too early to tell but the manufacturer touts the longevity of their product i like it	21
0	i bought this for my son 's fourth birthday because he 's a superhero nut it 's a cute toy except for one critical flaw it does n't come anywhere near fitting around the waist of my average sized 4 year old \( wears a size 4t \) i'm talking about three inches of waist gap on even the smallest setting yet the belt can be adjusted to a size that would fit a teenager if you have a 9 year old who loves running around in a batman costume go for it as for my 4 year old he still plays with it sometimes but we keep it on him with a pair of firefighter 's suspenders update the thick plastic of the belt is now ripped halfway apart we 've only had it two months and he 's hardly played with it for the abovementioned reasons not so great for batman but perfect for playing super chintzy toy man	21

0	i was originally going to buy clickclack \( made in new zealand \) storage containers to save money i bought these \( china made \) containers instead and it was a big mistake the first bad sign was a long black hair stuck in one of the containers the soft plastic parts of the lids that seal the containers had rough edges and were poorly trimmed the clear plastic of the containers had all sorts of scuff marks the final straw came when i dropped one from about 3 feet and 3 inches of the lip broke off rendering the container useless for airtight storage and that 's assuming that the somewhat loose fitting lids actually make the containers airtight if you want containers like these spend the money on clickclack or some other quality brand i'm surprised target sells these at all	21
1	adobe has totally re done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to cs if you are a quarkxpress user you 'll find that in indesign cs2 you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy to use manner the tools and tool palettes are where you 'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen small touches like being able to save your workspace like you can do in photoshop cs2 are great i tested the integration between indesign cs2 and some of its counterparts in the adobe creative suite premium i created different graphics in photoshop cs2 and illustrator cs2 and i found it was really easy to import them into indesign cs2 and use you can effects like drop shadows and feathering to images directly in indesign cs2 no need to go to another program with the control palette you can also resize objects too this palette functions with transform and stroke features for graphics and it includes paragraph character and table features for text editing what the palette does is affected by the type of selection you have made either graphic or text i imported some formatted text in from microsoft word 2003 and two different tables in from microsoft excel 2003 i was concerned how the tables would appear after the import from microsoft excel the tables imported easily with indesign cs2 you can now automatically style microsoft word files on import by mapping word styles to indesign cs2 styles as well an issue for a long time has been how to preview or view other types of files that you want to incorporate with indesign cs2 now adobe bridges that gap bridge now comes as a part of indesign cs2 and the premium suite so viewing any adobe type formatted file or standard graphic format is easy to do using the same interface between the different programs is a help as well adobe bridge is a standalone program being a web designer and using adobe \( formerly macromedia \) dreamweaver 8 i was familiar with using snippets these are portions of code you can save for use in other programs or you can export them to give to someone else now indesign cs2 offers this snippet capability you can export objects as snippets these objects can be shared or reused in other documents simply place or drag a snippet into a layout and indesign re creates the original objects their formatting and their relative positioning on the page no more wasted time redesigning just to get something you have brought in from another document to fit indesign cs2 also now has an info palette that is just like those found in photoshop and illustrator size dimensions and resolution are immediately available by selecting the graphic and simply glancing over to the info palette this is a crucial tool when fitting graphics in a specifically space limited area it 's important to know the actual dimensions with which you are working sometimes in designing and re designing printed work you have to move objects when this happens your structure can often change in different ways indesign cs2 helps you maintain your layout by allowing you to anchor your callouts pull quotes margin notes and graphics to text you can now precisely control the positioning of anchored objects apply text wrap settings and more as with other adobe products it is very easy to export your finished work in pdf format indesign cs2 works so well at exporting to pdf it even maintains the layers in acrobat 7 you can pre define your acrobat export settings as well indesign cs2 also supports specialty pdf formats like pdf x 1a and pdf x 3 which are used in workflows it also supports high resolution cmyk output and color managed workflows if you are familiar with previous versions of indesign the upgrade to the new version is easy indesign cs2 is even backwards compatible cs you will find that your learning curve is greatly decreased loren elks group managerd mag or	21

0	prior to purchasing this item i read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe i wish i heeded this advice because on top of fasciitis i developed severe toe pain by using this product i then had to by a second product anyway that thankfully eliminated the toe pain even though this is less expensive than other night splints it may do more harm than good go with a firm non toe injurying splint instead	21
1	the fisheye lens is a lot of fun and i enjoy using mine however i find that the practicality of the lens is minimal i do n't usually want my serious photographs to have fisheye distortion i do n't tend to like the 1 6x crop on canon 's lower end digital slr cameras but with the fisheye this has an interesting benefit it 's reasonably easy to use the fisheye as a standard wide angle lens since most of the distortion is removed by the 1 6x crop you can still get distortion but it 's a lot easier to compose a shot without it using a 1 6x camera than a full frame camera either way lots of fun buy one for the enjoyment or even for professional assignments if your work calls for it but think about if you really want the distortion before getting one of these	21

0	i own many sony products including a sony cybershot dsc f717 which i love however i am very disappointed by this camera the sony cybershot dsc t5 i bought the t5 for my mother and father as a present it is small lightweight portable easy to use and stylish it does take nice photos in brightly lit environments especially outside however after several months of use a few problems have become consistently evident \( 1 \) there is horrible red eye \( and white eye \) artifact in many pictures the so called red eye reduction setting does nothing \( 2 \) dim light photography is very grainy with lots of noise night time photography is impossible these problems are not unique to our camera you will find many corroborating reviews above overall i am very disappointed in this camera and wish i could exchange it for something else do not buy this camera other reviewers suggest the t7 or t9 take much better pictures \( and they are still small pocket size cameras \)	21

1	i tried all the possible creams on the market cheap and expensive for my dark circles but this is the only one that worked imediately i cannot live without it this is a keeper it stings a little bit not all the time but it does it says that it should only be used twice a day but if i 've had a really tiring week and i'm in a rush to look good i use it up to five six times a day just a tiny film and with 2 hours between them i guarantee that in three days you 'll not recognize yourself \( in a good way \) very important it tends to dry the skin under the eyes very much so be sure to aplly after a very good cream \( i use pure chamomile cream \) and leave it over night well follow my recipe and you 'll shine fast you 'll see	21
0	this second part of xenosaga compares very badly to the stellar first part regardless of what anyone says i no longer wanted to play this game after only 30 minutes the game begins with lots of boring instructions for a very non intuitive battle system annoying amount of experience points is needed to defeat nearly every main enemy including the very first one battle result and saving screens are a painful chore battle camera is inadequate and characters look and act like small puppets the game has very few items weapons or armor to deal with even ordinary enemies which are stronger than expected the skill combination that will be successful on a main enemy is not available until engaged by that enemy battles with main enemies are long which is n't such a problem however they often conveniently power up at the end of the battle just to frustratingly finish off a battle weakened party voice acting is very uninspired and sometimes even annoying i do n't remember any music from this game so plain it is some character changes are likely to upset at least half of everyone who liked the first xenosaga very noticeable is the use of swearing which is the main reason i do n't enjoy or watch hollywood movies during my rest and relaxation anymore new meaningless characters have been introduced into the story and the focus shifted far away from the main characters the cover character hardly says or does anything this time there is one short scene between the main characters during a critical moment but if you blink you will miss it this game is far more frustrating than challenging which is not a good game trait i do n't recommend even playing this game before reading the above to fully prepare for the disappointment that awaits if you 're looking forward to anything that made the first xenosaga great you will be extremely disappointed the second xenosaga is better completely avoided	21

1	i 've been subscribing to paste for over a year now and it 's a great magazine i agree with what others have said about the writing the interviewers often seem in love with their subjects and deal with the musicians as fans instead of as journalists there are tons of reviews in each issue on a wide variety of bands and music and the sampler cd and dvd are worth the subscription price all by themselves it 's a great way to listen to bands that you would never have heard otherwise if you love music and are spending a small fortune on cds this magazine is for you my only real criticism of the magazine is that it is very text heavy with tons of small print jammed onto each page often with a background picture design behind the words which makes it a chore to read i would love to see larger print and less eye junk on the pages then again i'm closing in on 40 so younger eyes may not find it as problematic	21

1	v for vendetta was already out on dvd before i finally saw it my college roommates told me that it was a great movie so i finally went to blockbuster and rented a copy the next day i returned the copy and went to best buy and bought my own copy of the movie it was that good v for vendetta takes place in the not so distant future in england where the residents have a curfew that they need to follow if they do n't want to be arrested dirty cops and policemen hand out their own cruel form of justice and where our female hero evey payed by natlie portman lives after being cornered by several dirty cops evey is rescued by the charismatic fast talking highly intelligent masked man simply named v v is a man of many words and he explains in the movie that he is tired of the big brother style of living that everyone has to endure although the government controls the entire city v is upset that the population is not fighting back and taking back their own lives he explains he is a one man crusade to evey as he blows up the old bailey building to opera music as he laughs uncontrollably at one point this is a movie anyone will like except you probably would n't want the kids watching because of the violence and language v is a guy you will totally like because he is charming to the ladies cool to hang out with and watch movies his favorite is the count of monte cristo and also is one tough son of a bitch who uses knives and martial arts to take out his enemies evey is also great to see in this movie she is the daughter of political activists who were killed after speaking too loud against government corruption she also literally got her head shaved in one of the scenes in the movie ! natalie portman was great the movie is awesome to watch it is fast paced and exciting in a lot of scenes from v taking over the tv station in england and talking on every single tv screen in the city as he fights the government to evey getting caught by the government and sitting in a cell for several months with a shocking ending great movie to see the extras include freedom forever ! the making of v for vendetta designing the near future the artistic look at making v for vendetta remember remember the look at the man named guy fawkeseaster egg ! a saturday night live digital shortplus more !	21

1	we recently moved and our two cats were having a few anxiety issues while adjusting to the new apartment one cat usually friendly and playful would hide anytime a new person came into the apartment the other cat usually very docile was being overly aggressive during play time with the other cat and with us after buying the comfort zone plug in we noticed a gradual change in their behavior over about a week both cats seemed more relaxed and their behavior was more normal more friendly and playful less anxious and aggressive the only reason not to give 5 stars is because the description says one plug in vial will last 4 weeks but the vial was nearly empty after only 2 weeks and completely empty after 3 but maybe there was more in the diffuser even though the vial had no liquid left it is hard to judge when the plug in actually ran out because the cats' behavior did not change even after i unplugged the diffuser	21

0	after owning 3 blackberry 's over the years i made the switch to the blackjack because of the camera and the ability to add memory compared to the blackberry the microsoft operating system is very cumbersome \( for me \) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially on the plus side the blackjack has good battery life the screen is excellent and it has the best reception i 've ever experienced the reason i only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink \( ie the numbers \) began wearing off the keys it 's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable especially when it 's backlit i called cingular first who passed me on the samsung where after 2 hours on the phone i was told that my only option was to send the phone \( my primary source of communication \) to their service center and wait 3 weeks to my surprise they went on to say that at their discretion they might also charge me for the repair i 've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and i always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that i 've encountered this i do feel it 's worth considering if you 're thinking about a blackjack i encourage you to be aware that for one the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys and that you may well be on your own when it comes to service i feel that it 's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right	21

0	more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i would n't make that connection having read a few of faulkner 's works sturgeon uses many of faulkner 's narrative trademarks \( i e streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative \) but i did n't feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others so the idea might of been original in the 50 's but topics like telekenesis esp computer brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before \( asimov \) and since this book rarely set off that wow ! button in my head or kept me turning pages this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best in 1953 there were 5 hugo award nominees for best science fiction book \( determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004 \) the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting \( in this example \) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society ca n't really be ignored besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood 's end and farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci fi needless to say more than human did not win \( farenheit 451 did and rightfully so \) bottom line i wanted to like this book and it does n't surprise me that others give it such high praise these are probably people that do n't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests	21

1	the easy sprouter is a great vertical sprouter the seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes the inner cup sets in the outer cup which catches any dripping water and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides maintaining your growing sprouts \( for most seed types \) means holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds allowing excess water to drain off and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup doing this two or three times a day makes sure that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough to avoid spoiling moist enough not to dry out but never remaining in standing water most seeds need to be pre soaked initially and this step can be managed directly in the easy sprouter there are three lids two lock into place one with air holes one without the third is domed but does n't actually lock onto the cup by comparison sprouting in canning jars requires the jar to be filled and emptied several times with each rinsing and draining sufficiently is not always easy the sprout master which is another sprouting tray i love allows similar rinsing but the seeds must be soaked in a different container and then transfered to the sprout master the sprout master allows the growing plants slightly more light because it has width rather than height but the difference is slight i 've mostly used my easy sprouter for leafy sprout salad mixes \( alfalfa clover etc \) these varieties take about a week to grow with the variety of lids the sprouter it is very flexible i have n't tried to sprout while traveling but i'm confident that it would work well it works for storing your grown sprouts in the fridge as advertised but i usually take them out of the sprouter and break up the clumps before serving and put any left overs into a different container i use my easy sprouter nearly constantly along with my sprout master mini trays i currently have a second easy sprouter on order	21

0	this was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film i kept looking at my watch the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about william shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama my girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but i was n't in the mood she forced me to watch this the film was about a struggling young writer shakespeare played by joseph fiennes who falls in love with lady viola played by gwyneth paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play romeo and juliet this film also won a couple of oscars including gwyny for best actress but i felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old english style thats hard to understand overall the film was just o k i think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and judi dench was great as queen elizabeth but i never want to watch this film again if your a shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than i did	21

0	i bought this aquarium for my son for his birthday last summer and thought it was great that is until it started leaking about 4 months after i bought it giving the benefit of the doubt and thinking the leak was a qa issue rather than a design issue i managed to exchange it for the exact same model well it 's been 4 months since i got the new one and this morning what did i notice \? yup a leak the tank was full yesterday and this morning it 's 2 3 's full with a pool of water on the table that holds it luckily no damage was done to the floor either time i understand there are sometimes manufacturing issues with a product now and then but when the same leak occurs in the same product after the same length of time well then it 's just a cruddy product stay away from this aquarium	21

1	i purchased this cd with the intent of finding fine players playing fine music what i found however was and outstanding example of chamber music as its finest the ensemble these 3 players generate is some of the finest ensemble music playing recorded each player displays exceptional technique both in the mechanical and lyrical aspects of their playing most impressive is listening to istomen who playing a very technically and lyrically demanding part voices his playing with such finess and carefull attention to detail to the strings a feat very difficult to do as a pianist this is an excellent recording for the professional to study a score from or for the avid listener to play over and over	21
1	this is just a great cd whenever i need to restore inner harmony after work or dealing with any upsetting situation this is the one i go to instantly i am transported to the calm soothing setting of a traditional japanese house and garden it is fantastic for meditation too let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording	21
1	the dispenser looks good holds a decent volume of shampoo conditioner etc it is simple to refill the bottles and so far there is no leakage the mounting was easy glued onto the tiles with silicone glue \( included \) if it broke or we decided to replace it we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles the top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf the little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads overall satisfied good product for the price	21

0	its a good accessory for archos product i have 604 wifi its compatible with generation 4 archos devices pros 1 \) good build2 \) enough connections to expandcons 1 \) it very much costly as compare to it utility 2 \) it comes with charger which should be a part of standard item 3 \) there could be more cables included in this package like spdif usb mini cable 4 \) in this cost it could have a backup battery \( extra \) that could be part of \( built in \) the docking station so that archos device can have longer play time i think archos has a built in mentality of making as much as money they can if it is then it would not go a long	21

0	i recently decided to become vegetarian so i got this book to read i was very disapointed i think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals yet is written in a boring scientific way this book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians than to teenagers this book contains a lot of recipies and some of them sound good but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook i would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians but there are better books written for the teens themself this book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu i do n't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians there is enough of that without reading about it however if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book wo n't hurt it is just a dissapointment	21

1	this is the story of two navy lifers who are given an assignment of transporting an 18 year old for a petty theft to prison one of the lifers feels pity for the kid and decides to show him a good time before he has to serve his 8 year sentence the prisoner it turns out has not experienced much and the 2 show him what he 's missed all within a 5 day period jack nicholson puts in yet another great performance while otis young and randy quaid put in credible performances other people make appearances like carol kane as a prostitute and look for a gilda radner before her saturday night live days in a brief apperance this is a very good film but i would n't say it were great for no particular reason other than it not being that interesting of a story nor a film that i would want to watch over and over again it definitely is worth seeing though at least for nicholson fans	21

1	i wear this watch every day and i usually work outside i am very pleased with the features and the durability it seemed daunting to work the features at forst but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy i have only two complaints one is that the metal band has developed a slight squeak when i move my wrist sometimes the tin man needs oil the second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night the watch does not always get the time signal from ft collins i have gone as long as several days without getting it but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all i am ok with the spotty reception	21
0	i'm going to start this review by saying that i came to the wii as a lifetime pc only gamer i have never felt the need to buy a console until the wii and its fun controller system came out the aspect i was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard together with the added entertainment of using it for other motion activated actions within the game \( rowing throwing grenades close combat etc \) as a result after spending the night out in the cold to get my console and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise i grabbed three games zelda \( a no brainer \) trauma center and call of duty 3 of those three titles i'm sorry to say that cod 3 was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouth as i have stated before i am a pc gamer i'm really into my hobby and love the satisfaction of building a pc which can manage all the latest games i played cod 1 and 2 on the pc and greatly enjoyed both by far the biggest problem with the wii version however especially as someone accustomed to playing on the computer are the graphical shortcomings of the title i literally had no idea what was going on i could barely tell which direction the enemies were coming from and the only reason why i was going in the right direction was because of the linear construction of most of the levels added to this i had no idea how to get rid of the first german to engage me in hand to hand combat \( a much advertised feature which is actually just an interactive cut scene \) i followed the instructions to wave my controllers around wildly and although i worked myself into a frenzy \( causing my dogs to panic and think something really was attacking me \) that inevitable german \( i tried throwing all my grenades into the room he hides in \) kept clubbing me to death even beyond this setback i found that the controls were often quite poorly implemented it is also disappointing \( yet speaks volumes \) that the grenade 'throwing' function that involves you actually 'throwing' the nunchuck \( without letting go by the way unless you 've got a backup tv \) is disabled by default trying to use it usually gets you to miss your target get cut down blow yourself up for the record i know that the wii controller works i 've played many hours of other games already \( as the system conveniently informs you \) this just seems like a shoddy implementation of it i can definitely tell you that there is a lot of ambition here to convey the frenzy of war with some obvious strong attempts at creating absorbing combat scenes nevertheless it essentially boils down to being a messy soup of blurry pixels which even to my gameplay over graphics mentality in buying the wii blocks the enjoyability of this title to be honest it has made me think that ww2 is n't the best suited area for the wii after all these historical titles tend to rely a great deal on cinematically portraying the visceral splendor of war rather then pushing exciting new gameplay elements my advice on the fps front wait for the wii 'far cry' game and see how that turns out in the meantime there are countless hours of other great titles more suited to the wii graphics waiting for your attention before leaving you i 'd just like to clarify on thing this is the perspective of someone who has very little experience with consoles perhaps you 're reaction to the game will be very different if you come to the wii straight from a gamecube instead of pc high definition gaming oh and if you 're still determined to buy it keep an eye out for my used copy of the game i'm going to need the money for 'banana blitz'	21

0	as the opening cutscene introduces you to blinx the cat the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures i found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story the idea is that a secret off world clan of humanoid cat creatures armed with souped up vacuum cleaners are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map it seems that time when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats takes the form of one of five different brightly colored shapes if these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things they turn into monsters i could go on because the game certainly does n't stop there but i think you get the point i like to think that there 's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super detailed realism generally a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game because they 're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic lifelike location cartoons on the other hand generally do n't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time how much fun would the wile e coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics \? blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that 's overly detail centric in an environment that 's right out of a kid 's show the result is a tale that comes off as way way out of left field and almost completely abstract it focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer 's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic there 's a princess evil pigs have kidnapped her and it 's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world that 's it no side stories no reasoning no subplots just a straightforward rush from point a to point b and here i thought the phrase save the princess was universally recognized as an ages old cliche now i do n't want it to sound like i'm railing on this game just because it 's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor it 's also completely lacking in character development general storytelling and ongoing inspiration none of the characters in blinx really establish themselves as individuals including the lead character himself you do n't hate the pig on the spaceship because he 's trying to destroy the world you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money i honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three because she 's never mentioned between the game 's start and its finish i mean the very first super mario brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight i do n't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging the first level and a half are set up in the standard get to know you format with the simplest of enemies the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools shortly thereafter you 're thrown to the wolves for the most part the level designs are very short with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge i noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts whether it 's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk \( har har \) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point you 'll almost always know what needs to be done but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick i just ca n't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is if there 's a bottomless pit nearby \( and chances are very good that there is \) blinx will find a way to force himself into it regardless of what you 're hitting on the control pad if there 's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button he 'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room rather than the imminent threat that 's not to say that the entirety of the time sweeper is totally without merit because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings the ability to control time for instance was at the time a really fresh interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged you can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time knock the level into slow motion etc all the while blinx is moving around in real time it 's a great idea but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized why ca n't i use two controls at the same time \? why do n't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers \? why does n't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed up or rewind when i use my time powers \? why is their duration so brief and why ca n't i hold more than a dozen uses at a time \? i mean this could 've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run of the mill platformer the controls too are an undeveloped undertested nightmare blinx himself is often sluggish to respond especially when implementing his time controls he has difficulty making a precise turn whether on midair or on solid ground he stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks he routinely moves in the direction of certain death as though pulled by a magnetic field whether you 've instructed him to do so or not he 'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump particularly when attempting a difficult precise leap across a gaping chasm i think it 's these controls that most make blinx so mind squashingly aggravating at a glance you 'd imagine they 'd be fairly difficult to screw up you 've got a jump button a suction fire button a time control button and an analog stick to control movement plus there had already been a long established line of three dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title 's release paving the way to an ideal control experience super mario 64 had its issues sure but nothing like this and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre 's jump to the world of 3d it 's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway i ca n't even say i'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout the time sweeper either with the exception of the lead character himsef these are some incredibly cheesy preschoolish character designs they feel unfinished and hurried less purposeful than you 'd imagine \( especially in contrast with blinx himself \) particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury here 's a finely detailed main character with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again and he 's pitted against a set of monsters that could 've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four year old 's sketchbook despite featuring a spoken dialog track there 's no english voice acting i could n't pinpoint the language but my wife seems to think it 's either french or some close variation of it it certainly did n't sound japanese while this does add a touch of personality to the title and it 's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television everyone 's vocal personalities are so black and white too that i feel like a great chance to establish some much needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here the bad guys all have the same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while the good guys are all bright cheery squeaky and high pitched like the monkeys in super monkey ball it 's like a parody of the games that had come before but i wo n't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose overall blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package strapped to the shell of a far below average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public at the time of its release it was still in need of a lot of polishing some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality on top of that i really do n't know which audience they were targeting with it the game is ridiculously difficult which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there but so bright kid friendly and annoyingly cutesy that i ca n't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day the number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with blinx reaching near marvel vs capcom 2 levels with its unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially in later levels i have no idea how i acquired the willpower to finish level eight the game is adequately lengthy and offers some replay value with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials and the like once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super tough later levels though you 'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps \( i shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process \) and enjoy self mutilation i 'd recommend you stay far away	21

1	sandra bullock gives an outstanding and believable performance in the role of angela bennett in this film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert an online hacker friend calls to tell her he 's found an amazing disk and is sending it to her to check out unfortunately he 's killed in a plane crash before he can visit her the disk turns out to have secret government information and is wanted by a terrorist group who plan the downfall of the u s government angela bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and before she really realizes what she has she finds that she 's being stalked what happens next is everyone 's worst nightmare through the miracle of computers the evil group steal angela 's identify and there are few people to vouch for her the story quickly turns into a cyber thriller she tries to get help but she appears to have no friends and does n't even know her own neighbors her mother \( diane baker \) is in an institution and is apparently suffering from alzheimer 's her former boyfriend played by dennis miller does try to help her but the forces of evil are difficult to hide from jeremy northam delivers a spine tingling performance as the charming and mysterious jack devlin a man you really want to trust but should you \?	21
1	sometimes i wonder how it is we do n't live in a vigilante society people do such awful things and alot of times the system really ca n't do n't do anything for the victims well in this film this family was not going to just sit there and let the system dictate how their son 's killer would be dealt with story takes place in a small town where the strout family is a big deal you know the family that everyone in the community knows and basically the money makers there is also the fowler family which also make their way in the town she is a folk song teacher and the father is a doctor and they have 1 college age son frank that is dating an older woman \( marisa tomei \) and she has 2 sons well the strout family 's son is married to marisa tomei and is not dealing well with the fact that she is dating the college boy and they are n't even divorced yet ca n't say that i blame him there but it is inherent that he is a real prick and probably treated her and their sons poorly moving along the strout 's son kills frank and because of the strout 's clout and the fact that the ex wife did n't actually see him fire the shot he is going to get off with manslaughter this does not sit well with the fowler 's the fowler 's have a friend that has over 300 acres of land so you can only imagine what happens i certainly do n't condone vigilantism however i just loved the ending the strout family put up property and funds to cover his bail so since it appeared that he jumped bail they will lose all of that beautiful ! then they were able to get some pleasure from the fact that they will never have to see that jerk again roaming the streets i could n't help but get some satisfaction out of that myself very real and very interesting great movie	21
1	i just walked a mile to buy this cause my car is dead and i do n't know anyone in this town yet i'm excited to have found this but it really would be nice to have even a 3 4 inch power cord so i can use my extesion cord that has a double sided female end as it is though you need an extension cord that is made for only plugging in one unit to female end cause the blades on instant power are recessed in a small area i'm sure this product functions well the owner at ace hardware told me he has one and he loves it it is frustrating though to have to walk right back to the store again in freezing temperatures just cause the product does n't come with cord nor say on the box that one is required but not included actually i just noticed it does say on box just connect an extension cord but that would n't have prevented my hastle if i had seen that at the store cause i have an extension cord just not one with only one female connection	21
0	having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch i was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas to see what a commercial frame would be like after using it for a few weeks i have to say that if it was n't a present i would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation the good screen is bright images look great resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me does n't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen computer connection worked great i plugged it into my xp box all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up it would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue the bad my main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before if i bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost 50 i could have forgiven it for the poor design but in 2007 for 180 it is completely unacceptable we live in the future here people get with the program ! i have not used other frames on the market but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12 screen on ebay for 70 strap it into a cheap frame and make your own pc based screen that works 100 times better than this frame just by running a screen saver for under 150 i 'd say this frame is not worth the money at all this screen just does n't deliver the goods for the price some details menu system is insanely poorly designed for instance you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings pushing the setup button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny ir hole in the front of the screen screen only works as a horizontal frame there is no way set it up as a vertical frame \( i e as a 480x640 frame \) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this feature off the slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that does n't change no way to connect remotely to the computer or to easilyget images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens	21

1	i 've been watching silver a for a while thinking to buy it from amazon while it is on sale but i finally decided to get it from a local ace hardware store here is why the pirces are not significant differrent between amazon and ace but ace offered free assembly free delivery free gas refill and the most important feature to me is they allowed me to upgrade it to stainless steel cooking grates and flavorizer bar for only 20 extra \( which is 100 value on amazon \) with the regular grates and flovorizer bar you have to replace it in a couple of years and hard to clean but the stainless steel type may last much longer and easy to maintain so if you buy it from amazon you have to pay base price plus shipping cost self assembly gas refill upgraded cooking grates and flavorizer bar etc the choice is yours	21
1	i just got this grill a couple of days ago and i am psyched ! i 've always been a bit of a charcoal snob but i wanted to expand my repertoire beyond just the weber charcoal grill and the bradley smoker i have it was a snap to put together and it only took me about 20 25 minutes i was able to lift it onto the legs in step 3 by myself without a problem you just need to be careful i did a ton of research and opted for the weber mostly because of my experience with their quality products and i did n't want to chance it with a semi unknown brand from home depot i chose the genesis gold as i do n't necessarily like all the stainless steel framing in the genesis platinum line but i wanted the stainless steel grates and flavorizer bars that the genesis silver does n't have also i wanted the b as opposed to the c as i do n't really use the side burner it lights quickly and evenly and it does heat up in a jiffy i do like the convenience of gas i 've also got a smoker box for the grill to add the smoke that i like to compensate for the lack of charcoal flavor however for low and slow true barbecue i 'll stick with my bradley smoker as the water vapor from the propane as it burns does n't allow proper penetration of the smoke into the meat this grill rocks	21

1	i bought this even though i saw a lot of negative reviews some about battery life some about dropped signals so far i have had neither i have owned many palm devices over the years and i will be the first one to say that palm can make lemons and when that happens they usually deny it until they come up with a patch much later if they ever do not the most customer oriented quality oriented company out there but their os is still the easiest to use in my mind and with the myriad of apps out there you can make it do whatever you want pretty much the screen is on the smallish side compared to the tx but it 's not that bad especially for a phone it 's pretty reliable and i have put a lot of my old software on it the battery is what surprised me the most i was expecting something really bad but so far i have never been under 50 and i am a heavy palm user i do n't use the phone part of it much just a call here and there and i turn the phone function off at night i also bought kblightsoff which turns off the keyboard lights unless you are using it which probably helps a lot so with these two settings battery life is close to the tx in my opinion i have one dead pixel but that can happen to any electronics manufacturer i do n't like the 2 5mm jack at the bottom of the device that 's a terrible place to put it but with an adapter i can use my good headphones and sound is good get ptunes deluxe so you can use subsription music like napster or yahoo music i should receive my 8gb sdhc card tomorrow which will turn my treo into an iphone killer imho and for way less than 599 sound level is ok and you can get software that boosts it up if you 're deaf speaker level is loud ! the sms program is great the phone app is great and fast so overall it 's a great device i wish palm would n't charge an arm and a leg for accessories but you do n't have to buy from them	21
1	walk two moonssharon creechjoan graymrs cooperin this heart touching heart warming story about sal and her past comes together binding wonderful stories of her and her best friend phoebe her grandparents take her on a road trip along the way she describes her happy sad and beautiful stories touching you heart one story at a time i loved this book it was not only a good but also a great book because it teaches life lessons and it 's sad in many ways at the same time beautiful this book teaches you that life is there you have time it also teaches not to judge `a man until you 've walked two moons in his moccasins' and to not let sad things effect you and so much more ! i love this book so much if you 're fifth grade or older no matter what it will touch your heart i would suggest it any day it will be a page turner from beginning to end you 'll never put it down so pick it up and start reading it !	21
0	this bobber cooler is definitely a conversation piece i have had so many comments about it i used it when floating down a small river near home \( no rapids just calm water \) it does n't hold its weight literally the first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water the opening seam rides just barely about the water and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water the cooler then fills up with water which almost immediatly melts the ice and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better it might be ok the 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off plus they are facing the wrong direction if you bump something like a rock or a log it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler this cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current like a pool but i do n't suggest towing it behind anything i suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market	21
1	i love this film beautifully simple and human the characters are real flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them just like your own family i 've rented at least fifteen times and i never get bored of it it 's great any time of year but fantastic for the holidays	21
0	i 've been a fan of these games since the first one secrets can kill came out i 've played them all i'm not at all sure what 's happened to the games though while the graphics have steadily improved the puzzles plot and gameplay have really gone downhill the first game secrets can kill had pretty horrific graphics but the story was compelling and there were some fabulous puzzles in it things really picked up with the second game stay tuned for danger better graphics and a very interesting story very cool puzzles great plot i can absolutely recommend games 2 \( stay tuned for danger \) 3 \( message in a haunted mansion \) 4 \( treasure in the royal tower \) 5 \( the final scene \) 6 \( secret of the scarlet hand \) 7 \( ghost dogs of moon lake \) 9 \( danger on deception island \) and 10 \( secret of shadow ranch \) these games are similar in length and have interesting puzzles lots of areas where you can snoop around which i really enjoy game 8 \( the haunted carousel \) is interesting and has wonderful graphics but is awfully short i did not at all enjoy 11 \( curse of blackmoor manor \) as i found it way too difficult i also cannot really recommend 12 \( secret of the old clock \) it was too short and repetitive i did somewhat enjoy 13 \( last train to blue moon canyon \) and 14 \( danger by design \) but they were nowhere near the quality of the earlier games in terms of plot or puzzles and now we have 15 outstanding graphics but way too short the amount of repetition of puzzles in order to advance drove me completely crazy i do n't mind nancy running about doing errands to help people \( for that i thought games 3 and 4 had it perfectly balanced \) but i like each task to be different and interesting not mind numbingly repetitive and boring this seems to be a factor of the more recent games delivering telegrams in game 12 painting pictures in game 14 and now finding seashells and making necklaces in this game i miss looking for clues putting together evidence for a purpose i miss puzzles that actually are woven into the fabric of the plot and are there to advance the game it seems like the repetition now might be so that it can be said that this game took x number of hours to complete i also miss learning useful things in 1 i learned about american sign languagein 3 i learned about chinese symbols and the san francisco earthquakein 4 i learned about latitude and longitude and how a sextant worksin 6 i learned so much about the maya and how to work a ham radioin 7 i learned about roman numerals and prohibitionin 8 i learned how to make invisible writing ! in 9 i learned how to work a ham radio and about pacific northwest sea animalsafter that well i did n't really learn very much of anything useful in any of the later games if you 've never played a nancy drew game please please please do yourself a favor and start with one of the earlier games \( although probably not the very first one the graphics are n't as good and switching discs can be highly annoying \) but give 2 9 a try you wo n't be disappointed ! oh please her interactive please go back to the way they used to be structured i 'd gladly sacrifice some of the improved graphics if it meant regaining some plot cohesion or integrated interesting puzzles	21
1	good quality granola not too sweet would give it 5 stars but it does n't have enough nuts super nutty it is not it is worth the price though my wife would give it 4 5 stars she is mildly gluten intolerant and can eat this because it contains no wheat	21
0	it was n't clear from the packaging that this does n't work with the newer ipods with video i had to search the internet \( after i already purchased and could see that it clearly did n't fit \) to find this information	21
1	i love final fantasy games they are the reason that i still have my nes and snes this really does take me back to the early days of square admittedly i 've gotten older and my tastes have changed in the past 15 years \( i think its been that long since ff1 was released \) but this game just makes me smile completing the chocobo side quests making sure mognet gets back online defeating hades and ozma power leveling like a mad man laughing at zidane for being as bad with the ladies as i am all in all the important parts of the game are what kept me playing now i will say there are a few annoying parts you should never sell any equipment the synth shop is a wonderful idea but for some items at the end of the game you need weapons that you got at the beginning of disc 1 also some weapons disappear from the face of the planet as you switch discs that little fact causes quite an annoying problem for those of us who like to see every ability fully mastered for every character \( if you cant tell i was the kid that spent 3 months in the downed shin ra plane getting everyone to 255 stat points \) overall this is an outstanding game it keeps me wanting to play it makes my chronic insomnia relapse and i love just watching vivi dance during fights and watching zidane get shot down over and over in the interim the graphics of this game are simply beautiful its not something that will ooooo and ahhhh you but if you give them a second look \( after you get over the cartoon like feel \) you 'll notice that they someone took their time with this production someone made sure every single detail was perfect ffvii felt 2d and while you knew the scenery was a 3d endeavor it felt like a 2d isometric drawing rather than a fully 3d rendered scene when you look at ffix you know you are looking at a fully 3d environment it was a really great thing to see especially on the psx \( even though the xbox 360 is now out \) characters what can i say about the characters i love them they all make me smile i relate completely with zidane 's social life and then his story took me off guard the first time i heard it \( i was n't expecting it and it made me want to play longer \) garnet is interesting she is that naive girl we all knew in high school it just seems every character has their own story and it is pretty well explored \( really what do you know about yuffie zell quistis and irvine \) do you ever wonder how reeve controlled cait sith while he was talking to scarlet and heidegger \? i really do not have a lot of unanswered questions like that with ffix just some things that could have been elaborated on \( like the summoner 's village \) but all in all i think the story was pretty perfect my only big complaint and is the length of the game there is a lot of stuff to do but the end of the game can be reached in under 12 hours \( 4 months of work to get a certain sword stay with ragnarok if you are reading this saying i got excalibur ii is not worth the heartache \) this game gets 4 stars because while it is a good game i just wish there was more of it there 's plenty of side quest stuff just not enough story time 12 hours of story is just about as long as aeris stays breathing in ff7 hope this makes your purchasing decision a little easier its definitely a great game and heck if worse comes to worse it 's a good time killer for a rainy weekend	21
1	as we all know you 're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent sids the sleepsack is a great product ! it keeps baby nice and warm yet you do n't have to worry about a blanket and there 's space down in the bottom for his feet so he 's not too restricted also the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom so you do n't have a big zipper poking baby in the face	21
1	i already have 2 of the smaller versions for other lenses but wanted to be sure my efs 17 85 mm would be snug as a bug in its own pouch instead of a cheap felt sling thing well canon came through again with another of its soft felt line the lp1116 this pouch is thick and has the same firm bottom made of naugahide that protects the inside lens the cord is strong and silky and does n't open accidently the way a silky cord would obviously we ca n't throw the pouch around and we have to be careful but it really does the trick and feels good in your hand the moment i buy another lens i shall have to buy its matching pouch	21
1	absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m fits perfectly	21
1	i actually got the snug tub deluxe this version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post it also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it i used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play my only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping i put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up this was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping i'm glad i bought this instead of the eurobath	21
0	the technology on here is great but the storyline is going no where what 's the point \? 3000 is creepy as usual and big boi 's acting is horrible when he 's paired against terrence howard they only got 1000 screens nationwide for this movie but it does n't matter 3000 screens or 1000 screens the bottom line is that this movie sucks	21
1	this lens has gotten some bad reviews i think partly because it is starting to show it 's age this was the first usm is lens and the technology has really grown since then if canon were to come along with an updated 75 300 usm is lens man it would blow everything away that being said yes this lens is a little slow to focus but if you are not using it for work like one of the professional sports photographers you see on the sidelines at baseball games you should be okay it also could use an extra stop \( or two or three ! \) because when you are handholding you need that aperture to be as open as it can be all of this aside i really have gotten some gems of pictures out of this lens it lets you get as closer then you possibly could hope for if you have asteady hand and plently of availible light you can get some really nice shots if you are in a low light situation you will need a tripod the is of lens works pretty good but i have had a number of ever so slightly blurry pictures that would n't have been had there been some more aperature room to play with all in all its a good starter telephoto lens especially for digital slrs since it really extends the zoom on those its great for the price and when you decide to upgrade to one of those white canon l beauties just sell it	21
1	i love this show so much ! ! it just has so much passion and beauty and all the cast members sing so well ! ! sutton foster as jo was cast very well its obvious she deserved that tony nomination in 2005 and the sisters even though they were n't the leads they all had such great songs especially beth whose song some things are meant to be always brings tears to my eyes its just so touching i would definitely recomend this cd to anyone who loves musical theatr	21
1	this play tent is great my son got it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later he brings toys in there and hides to play it is not unsafe it will tip over at times but it 's so lightweight that it could not hurt him i think that it 's a great buy for the money and would recommend it	21
1	bought this for our girls 2 and 4 huge hit even before the batteries were put in the blow dryer this set is great for several reasons and i 'll try to list the top few first the dryer actually has a little fan in it that whirrs loudly enough to seem real but not so loud as to disturb the cat when she is getting her fur done \( uncommon for a kid 's toy \) also the nail polish and eyeshadow are both made to open and use but no mess and once you have removed the inner packing materials the bag is large enough for headband and tiara storage a must for today 's princess the one thing i will caution you about is the curling iron if your child has longer hair like my girls do it can get tangled when hair is being curled fortunately the curler has no moving parts so tangles are discovered long before any permanent damage is done all in all a pretty sturdy little set for 15 great for practice make overs and such but probably not for experienced princesses as there is no actual make up involved just imagination perfect for my house ! no glittery door handles or perfumed pets !	21
0	i have used a lightweight hoover for years and was very pleased with it when i first received this new cleaner i was really excited with the power it had the third time i used it the belt broke with each use my back would start hurting the forward motion was very easy but pulling it back was hard i returned this product because i felt there was something wrong with it	21
0	i bought 2 of these and they are horrible ! youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse !	21
0	i'm sorry but this is honestly one of the worst movies i 've ever had the displeasure of witnessing i purchased it after reading ambitious reviews that cited this movie was what mainstream horro should be in reality it 's nearly everything that 's wrong with low budget films first off the camera work is horrible secondly i 've seen more convincing actors in elementary school plays i mean these actors make keanu reeves look like denzel washington and finally the story was absolutely horribly done i admit the premise itself had some promise but the way it was executed completely took away any interest factor i might have had plain and simply this film was unwatchable i turned it off 65 through it and i would 've turned it off earlier but i was hoping for some beacon of hope to appear on the screen if you care at all about quality in any sense do not go near this piece of trash	21
1	this album was released in the summer of '86 when queen 's radio airplay was at a rather low point in the u s and at a very high point in europe by now the band had adventured into pop genres beyond rock yet colouring their songs with their distinctive style of interpretation and playing here we find the gorgeous ballad one year of love and the catchy friends will be friends the ominous anthem who wants to live forever and the highlander themed princes of the universe are gems in this crown the first two usa singles the rocker one vision \( from iron eagle \) and the danceable a kind of magic barely cracked the us top 40 in a decade when alternative music was preferred and classics were often overlooke	21
0	i ordered the dvd of damn yankees to watch on tv for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day i ordered it i paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the cd of only music ! i do n't think i will order from amazon again it was my first time and probably my last liz snyde	21
0	cooper 's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager of a real company it contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories along with trite sayings such as quot when you find a back door that 's open close it quot or my personal favorite quot use the lanterns of your life to help light the way quot if you 're looking for an inspirational book one with a solid basis forget this one you 'd be better off reading the daily horoscope	21
0	i thought this movie looked cool from the preview but it was a bit of a bore i had a vague idea of what the director was going for but it just was n't there film noir meets john hughes the female lead is intoxicating however not worth the four bucks	21
1	in the years i have taken this magazine i have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow 's news from the latest hot spot in the world so prescient it is eery if you have any interest in current events news or foreign affairs this journal is a must read the contributors are a who 's who of politics science and business in the world often the author list will become the under secretary of state list in the next administration for example the last issue discussed avian flu virus as a physician i can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was and now this stuff is on tv every day and i can amaze my patients with how much i know about the issue that no one else does reading this will definitely make you look smart try this experiment and see if i'm right this article is written in october 2005 days after receiving the october issue with multiple articles about china written by chinese authors of course that means that these articles are n't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what china wants us to believe i predict that china will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months so put this magazine to the test and see one negative is that although the authors are bi partisan regarding party they are not conservative you wo n't ever find pro tariff anti illegal immigration isolationist anti judicial activism or pro life articles in here indeed regardless of which party an author supports you can pretty much count on expanded government especially one world government presented as the solution and lastly some of the articles are deadly boring and contain stilted obfuscated diplomatic jargon you will rarely find a simple eloquent phrase but you will often find ideas that will pop up in any analysis of the news just realize many of these authors are diplomats and politicians whose careers depend on obfuscation and plausible deniability all in all this is an extremely influential journal that is full of cutting edge ideas just realize that many of them may be wrong	21
0	i had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend after just a few uses the steamer stopped working when the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed it just would n't turn on any more i contacted the first years manufacturer and to say the least they did have excellent customer service they had no problem replacing the unit upon receiving the second unit i used the steamer once and because the steamer could n't hold every thing on the first run i had to run it twice in a row to my disappointment i pressed the lever and again it did not work frustratingly i pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on unless you cool it for about a half hour or more this is how my unit operated i'm sure that not every one 's experience is the same but this was how mine was i definitely would caution buyers on the product only because this problem occured twice with the units that i have used	21

1	i bought this same crib in may of 2005 from buy buy baby and it came in six weeks pretty easy to assemble i did it while i was pregnant it had no scartches or chips i like it a lot and my daughter loves it we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2 but its very roomy it can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much i really like it cuz the quality is superb and we 're very very happy with in fact we bought another one from amazon for my son my kids are 12 months apart so we needed another crib for him since now hes 1 he likes it a lot too but even though company and everything is the same the crib did come with some damaging to it but it wasnt that bad you dont really notice it we got lucky i guess but i do plan to just paint over the parts where the white paint has come off the quality also seems different it doesnt seem as dense as the first one i bought i dont know whether the manufacturing has changed or its quality issues but overall its a nice crib i just wish it came in better condition and that it was the same wood feeling as the first one but its definately worth the buy and it came with super fast shipping with amazon and the shipping was free too but its well worth the buy ! ! ! ! ! ! my kids are happy and so im happy ! !	21
1	my just turned 6 year old can figure out 70 of the logic needed in this game he ca n't do a very few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy i had to finally defeat for him but he really likes this game he gets the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters it has a tad more killing of stuff than i care for but what does n't these days he likes being able to be different characters his favorite is puss n boots ! as a grown up i enjoyed it as well especially the humor	21

1	this seat along with the matching step stool are great ! my daughter loves having her very own special toilet seat and step for going potty it has encouraged her to potty train it fits the toilet seat nicely and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well	21
0	after trying almost every bottle i tried these and waht a nightmare ! there are to many parts to clean and they leak ! i called dr brown 's customer service line and they were on the defense and said you can not shake the formula to mix it you have to stir it as most people who use powder formula know this is not an option as just stiring very slowly as they say does not mix the formula i saw no difference using these other than they leak and a pian to clean and have to use a special brush to clean them i went with the playtex natural disposables and never looked back	21

1	i really enjoy my photosmart r725 it 's small easy portable takes wonderful photos and is very versatile in terms of settings i just have one thing i do n't like about it and that 's the fact that there is no viewfinder there is an lcd screen on the back which acts as a viewfinder but it 's hard to see in bright sunlight and i'm afraid that it will eventually become scratched beyond use for now it 's great but i'm not sure how it will hold up for the long run at the same time it 's not spendy so it might be worth it	21

0	i am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year i show the movie and this is a terrible version they leave out almost the whole story and change the rest it is such a great book and i think they could have done a better job on the video i am always hoping a newer and better version is made	21
1	i loved the first one and i think with the logic and plot of the first one this follows through we knew they changed the world and in this sequel we see that the actors do a good since the lead characters are suppose to be let 's say less intelligent but nice i think this movie and the 1st one are classics i like the grim reaper his atitude during the movie and the fact the he is the comic relief \( okay so most of the movie is comic relief \) even if they are fun to watch to laugh at it is worth it to watch	21
1	this is a great finisher use after you 've drenched your hair with leave in conditioner and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape smells great but does n't compete with the smell of other products only con a little bit does not go a long way it 's expensive to stock up	21

1	the story of alice in wonderland was controversial from the moment that the reverend charles lutwidge dodgson aka lewis carroll wrote it some took the story as horror rather than a childhood fantasy others consider alice 's journey as a trip into or through insanity for better or worse disney did capture many of these elements and the same criticisms of the books that form the basis of this film apply to the film however there are also those who loved the books and loved the film normally i recommend disney classis without reservations in the case of this movie i will keep a couple of provisos alice is a young girl bored by her lessons as the length of the lessons grows alice soon drifts off until a white rabbit passes by muttering to himself that he is late alice follows the white rabbit and falls into a rabbit hole that seems to fall forever luckily for alice her dress opens out into a kind of parachute and slows her descent once at the bottom of the hole alice discovers a door into which she is unable to pass because the door is too small however there is a vial labeled drink me that alice discovers makes her small enough to go through the door alice is soon on her way into a series of surreal adventures that are in the best tradition of adult animation indeed alice might have worked better as an adult story given the number of references to adult vices and frailties throughout the film even the fundamental basis of alice 's journey through wonderland owes as much to psychological references as it does childhood fantasies the ending of alice 's journey in particular is quite frightening especially to younger children embodying all that can be horrible in nightmares i remember seeing alice in wonderland as a child and i remember i thought the ending was scary and i was relieved when alice was able to escape back to the normal world given that this film is well over fifty years old i was disturbed by the smoking caterpillar if for no other reason than our current knowledge of what smoking does the smoke did negatively affect alice as it made her cough perhaps there is an object lesson for children here while some consider many of the references to allude to drugs i think that is a modern interpretation i think eating or drinking items to get larger or smaller was merely a convenient plot device for the author rather than an allegory for drug use remember that this story was first published in 1869 i believe this film is excessively criticized by those who do not like its style and the post era associations with negative elements that were never intended by the original author and by disney for all these provisos this film is excellent it matches fantasia in its surreal visions and the construct and tying together of the individual stories is superb the animation is marvelous as well readily illustrating the vision of alice 's journey this movie is one of those rare disney films that i am unable to recommend to all viewers whether you will enjoy this film is strictly a matter of personal taste if you enjoy animation oriented toward adults then you may find this animation a treat if you are open minded about the story and consider when the story was written and animated you may also find that you enjoy it i do recommend this movie for slightly older children perhaps 8 and above considering some of the disturbing images good luck !	21

0	yuck this book was totally boring well maybe you 'll like it if you 're like 7 or 8 years old or something not only is it totally boring but poorly written which surprised me because ann m martin is certainly not a bad writer ! i'm really glad she left the bsc and started writing a new series about them the bsc books are soo boring and childish please a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog runs loose for 2 seconds do n't waste your time reading the bsc books they are all pretty dumb	21
1	juice newton is one of the best counry pop singers of all times a great energetic voice and some real unforgettable songs my personal favourites include the beautiful angel of the morning the rollicking queen of hearts and the strong and sorrowful it 's a heartacheafter all these years her work is unforgettable catchy and full of energy and vibe	21
0	i loved the watch when i first received it i wore it two or three times then a piece of the wire mess that the band is made of broke and was sticking up i tried to bend it around but the loose wire continued to snag my clothes so i stopped wearing it	21
0	do n't get me wrong occasionally there are issues i still read cover to cover but it seems as though mj has gone through a change lately gone is the focus of travel and fantastic adventure writing now the focus seems to be health fitness and diet i used to buy men 's health magazine for those topics if i wanted that focus i would continue to buy mh there is no longer a consistent reason to read mj on a regular basis anymore man i miss the old mj	21
0	i would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money for around 60 you could get the world industries m a d balance board and get a much better looking and more durable product or you could spend around 80 and get a bongo board if you really want the best and have the money for it you could spend about 120 and get an indo board the zoomboard that i received was green and blue unfortunately it looks garish but a child may like the look of this in addition to the garish coloring scheme the board has a rough sandy underside this is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube however after a couple weeks of using it \( five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs frame \) the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down then again if you wait it out the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you wo n't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube but the gripping surface will be compromised if you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before make sure there are no grains pebbles or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube this may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube overall this board is fun but not great quality if you absolutely cannot afford 10 more to purchase a much better product then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it if you can afford more keep looking and check out the products that i mentioned above and get something that 'll actually be worth your hard earned money	21
0	in short too expensive all eye candy no driver support from third parties and the licensing model makes a re install impossible without a telephone call to microsoft to verify that you are not stealing their software ! i upgraded my dell desktop system from xp media center to vista ultimate to fix several problems i was having with xp i found this to be a bad decision i first installed the 64 bit version of vista but found that there are virtually zero third party companies that support 64bit vista ! no drivers no working printers usb devices no internet security suites etc ! i then decided to upgrade to a larger hard drive the maxtor utility transfer utility did not work with vista at all ! it totally produced an unbootable system that the install cd could not fix i then re installed the 32 bit version of vista ultimate included in my upgrade box using the same license key the on line activation said that i already had this key in use and the only choices were 1 \) buy a new copy 2 \) type in a different license key 3 \) use the telephone to call microsoft i called microsoft and found that their automated assistant could not help and was transferred to a person with a semi strong accent who asked if this was the first installation and then asked if i was using it on the same machine \( yes it 's the same machine \) he then read a very long activation key to me that i had to type in i find this totally unacceptable the 32 bit version has better third party support but it 's not great yet i'm using a lot of beta drivers that i had to search hard to find the changes in the os are mostly eye candy from the end user 's perspective i find the new licensing model and policies assume you are guilty first and then makes you prove it in doing so microsoft is burdening the bulk of their honest customers with a lot of effort to just make their software activate jack booted policies like this will result in me buying from apple next time at least apple treats me like the honest customer that i am !	21
0	this camera has major problems do your research go to any digital camera forums and you will see tons of post of the black screen after using our camera about 5 times the screen became black apparently had to do with defective lens housing or something sent it to their customer care service took 1 month to get back 3 days later black screen is back sanyo is doing everything they can to prevent me from getting money back or get new camera they just want me to keep sending to customer care sanyo has a very defective product and they do not want to admit their mistake and replace the defective cameras see for yourself go to the forums and see what others have been saying do n't make the mistake i did	21
1	the beauty of this charger is that it is 110 220v compatable so with the appropriate international connector you can charge your batteries on european voltage i have used two of these with the plug adapters and have kept four sets of batteries charged overnight for two olympus cameras giving a day plus of batteries available for each very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors if you plan on traveling internationally this charger is a must !	21

1	i suppose one of the great attributes of the internet is that it allows the juxtaposition of the good the bad and the ugly where else could one find reviews of one of the twentieth century 's towering works that variously describe it as a recipe for a police state an incitement to theft or as written by someone with no understanding of philosophy \( my personal favourite thanks adrian !	21

0	first off the knife is great i would n't expect anything less from swiss army only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75 and since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it i give the knife a two only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well	21
1	the tekquest mosquito catcher is a sturdy well built device that actually does what it claims after setting up the unit according to directions i allowed it to run on 24 hr mode \( it also has a nightime only mode \) i let it run for a few days and checked the collection tray sure enough the remains of thousands of mosquitos and a moth or two had been collected once the mosquitos have been captured the remains begin a decomposing process so there is very little left of the pests after letting it run on 24 hr mode for several weeks i switched it to night only mode once the sun sets the unit turns on runs allnight until the sun comes out so far it has worked flawlessly and sitting out on our patio has become a welcomed event again thank you tekquest	21

0	i bought this camera in the beginning of january i was looking for a compact camera \( not necessarily pocket size though \) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality based on test reports at dpreview and other customer reports i decided for the fuji f31fd i was intrigued by the new sensor that fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive which is true after receiving the camera i took a lot of test pictures under various conditions with and without flash bright light low light different iso settings different exposure times etc i compared the pictures with my 4 year old sony dsc v1 and the results were amazing the picture quality of the fuji was very poor colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise even under bright light conditions and iso 100 settings the white had considerable noise same with other colors \( rgb noise \) i did n't check grey black noise \( as they do in the test reports \) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying what a disappointment the lens seemed to be pretty poor as well at least there was no comparison to the sony dsc v1 with a carl zeiss lens after one week we returned the camera and i bought the sony h5 this is really a great camera i must admit the picture quality is even better than with the v1 and i thought that the v1 was already pretty good i can only recommend sony 's h5 even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller f31fd what i liked about the f31fd was its size its responsiveness and the monitor and menu however if the picture quality is so poor it also does n't really help	21

1	there used to be a cereal called kix that had a jingle kids like kix for what kix has got mom 's like kix for what kix is not eye toy with play2 is the kix of video games i am the parent of a six year old girl like many parents i was worried about getting a video game system for my daughter given the prevalent headlines about kids not getting enough exercise then i saw eye toy advertised and i thought it could serve as a means to keep my daugther active but still allow her to participate in video game activities which kids love i bought eye toy with the play 2 video game and i could n't be happier with the results my daughter loves the games they are very inventive and if you 've seen the advertising you already realize that the eye toy camera puts the player 's image right in the middle of the action the system does n't work perfectly but close enough to simiulate activities from cooking to kung fu the game format also allows for fun head to head competition which is great for kids parties etc the best part is my daughter works up a real sweat when she plays the games the games have her jumping diving dancing punching and kicking she gets great exercise and has a lot more fun than if she was just sitting there the games are n't just for young kids either kids up to young teen age years seem to enjoy them too for that matter i enjoy them but i'm not worried about appearing cool we also bought my daughter the sega superstars disc for eye toy those games are geared for older children but there are a couple which my daughter loves too overall i could n't be happier with how this experiment turned out i really hope more people become aware of eye toy 's benefits because i think they are a great solution to a vexing problem maybe eye toy should buy that old kix gingle p s one thing the eye toy should come with is a lamp buy one of your own \( we use a desk lamp with flexible neck \) to make sure the area the player is in is very well lit if not the camera has a difficult time seeing the player and the results are n't as good	21

0	the lack of someone lurking behind prince 's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the fargnoli management team this is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to sade also make the feel of this track disjointed while prince fans will generally hype this track the reality is that 4 the tears in your eyes this is n't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121	21

0	3 stars overall only b c we love c3 ! read on the batcave c3 set has some rather intense structural integrity problems that cause it to be next to impossible to put together without a supplemental fix it set that was distributed by the mfg after many seasoned adults protested their frustrations with its construction since the company has now withdrawn all c3 items from its website it is not known whether the fix it package is still available \( it included thicker stronger support pieces for the first floor and additional pieces for a stairway support column \) without these the set tends to implode well before you ever get the 2nd level completed let alone the 3rd ! after all the problems started surfacing the company also increased the recommended age range to 7 from the previous 4 if you purchase a box that states 7 as the age range it should include the fix parts \( no guarantee we 're only assuming \) but even with the fix pieces it is still a major headache to put together and your true calling is an architect if you manage to get it safely together on the first try it takes most adults several tries over several days \( due to frustration stress level \) to get this piece fully assembled there is a step by step construction guide showing the problems \( with crash pictures \) in set construction amazon rules say i ca n't post the link here but it should n't be too hard to find if you enter c3 batcave in a search engine the full write up is in a c3 forum i know many people may still purchase it is after all batman but i would at least try to see if you can acquire the replacement parts before ordering as you will have much greater chance for success or wait until you get the package if it says 7 on the box you just may be in luck in the alternative maybe you could use super glue to the existing inadequate structural supports \? or raid your kid 's lego stash and use thicker more stable blocks than the ones supplied with this set	21
1	inport excellent job i love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone i 've had several hundred lps sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now i'm rediscovering that music all over again as i transfer the lps to the digital age the quality of the transfer is very good \( imo \) for example i was playing back so central rain \( early rem \) in itunes and noticed that i had purchased the song on itunes about a year ago except for an opening click on the lp version its very hard to tell the difference between the two my only minor negative \( or really feature request \) would be for lpripper to somehow integrate and automate song titles from the albums so that i do n't have to type them all in	21

0	the machine looks great it sat nicely on our counter top next to the kitchen aid mixer and looked really classy if that was all i wanted to do with it then i would have been very happy with it but i actually wanted to make decent lattes and espressos firstly i found the steamer wand to be awkward to use it rotates but has little movement up or down as a result i found it pretty impossible to steam milk without spilling some on the counter top when i was finished it produced good foam though secondly the indicator lights are so dim i found it difficult to tell whether the machine was ready or not finally the espressos i made had no crema at all i have been making them for 3 years with our current saeco machine with a delightful crema on each one after pulling the shot it continued to leak water from the filter holder the machine was constantly leaking water steam when it got up to temperature and the design of the drip tray is such that it is awkward to empty it without spilling everywhere in summary if you just want a pretty machine to sit on your counter buy this machine if you want to make decent espresso based drinks do n't	21

1	my sony fx1 has great low light capability 3 lux but eventually you will need extra light using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess no matter which camera you use i'm so glad i bought it used it for my birthday party though the overhead light was good dark corners of the room require more light if you consider yourself advanced semi pro or a pro videographer you must have a light my only major beef is it runs at either 10 or 20 watts no variable for 5 or 15 it is worth getting a long life battery like the np 970 independent power source \( battery \) is a plus but no outlet plug adaptor that i know of	21

1	philosophy products are very eye catching their smart clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each i work with skin care products and do n't always believe what they claim there are usually far too many claims to be made that simply ca n't be done to someones skin this product however is pretty good it 's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product but it does do the job it promises the only problem i have with it is that for someone with sensitive skin there is far too much frangrant extracts in here it cannot be good for sensitive skin i 'd recommend this to dry skin people only	21

0	a subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball quot nuts quot who grew up in new york we idolized the terribly tarnished ccny quot wonder five quot who set an unbreakable record by winning both the nit and ncaa titles in 1950 \( it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled \) this book is a fictional addendum to rosen 's non fiction treatment of the original basketball quot scandals quot as he outlines in his npr interview unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors broadway and 43rd street cannot be on the east side of manhattan madison square garden has been on 23rd street and is now above penn station in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th streets and eighth and ninth avenues these errors are particularly galling in a book by a new yorker who played at hunter college and they undermine the author 's credibility and care in writing since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence the game of who is this really is inescapable hence it is most unfortunate that rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers and quot a couple are in the hall of fame quot this tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as bob cousy \( holy cross '49 \) dick mcguire \( st johns '48 \) bobby wanzer \( seton hall '46 \) and frank mcguire the legendary coach at st john 's north carolina and south carolina	21

1	as an interior design student i find this magazine a wonderful source of inspiration variety and creativity this magazine is more about art and design than advice on do it yourself decorating or cheap furniture finds so do not subscribe to this if you are expecting the latter or else you will be sorely disappointed and become one of the reviewers who give one two star reviews here because they had expected this magazine to have a different more practical purpose	21
1	i enjoy the convenience of a point and shoot digital camera my minolta dimage x \( about 15 small in size than this camera \) had reached the end of its useful life having been around for about 5 years the minolta had a 3 4 screen on the back \( this one has a 2 5 screen great colors \) the best feature i liked about my old camera was the fact that there was not a telescoping zoom lens i do n't like the fact that a part that needs to move so often has the possibility to get gummed up and dirty therefore i was excited that this camera had an internal zoom tonight i was at a bulls game in the 300 section \( nose bleed \) and was able to zoom in and get a individual photo of kirk hinrich the 3x optical zoom is incredible but more so incredible is the digital zoom i was also able to zoom into the jumbotron and it looked as crisp as if i was taking the photo directly action shots are great low light shots are great ! it is exactly what i was looking for	21
1	actually i felt i was in love with this film as soon as i saw the very beginning the opening credits against the background of chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music candyman could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense but bernard rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant enchanting and spellbinding film out of it if you 're interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you wo n't find it here \( you will but not in quantities you used to \) candyman is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what 's important where mood is what matters where you are given some food for thought i do n't have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film i can only say it 's a great achievement of bernard rose as a director besides i guess tony todd virginia madsen and xander berkeley had their best roles played in this feature i do n't personally think that 90s were fertile regarding the horror genre but candyman is a true gem which would n't be lost among the greatest horror titles of all times by the way if you do n't want to spoil your impression of the film better do n't watch candyman parts 2 and 3 they are the average tenage urban legend flicks	21
1	i love these type of memoirs a person who is not boasting about their skill or having an attitude simply shares the love of his work and love of his county all of james herriot 's books are wonderfull i was introduced to the children 's books a few years ago and just recently started reading his memoirs love it some parts were a bit dry but the books still flowed well and drew you back love the depth of scenery and anicdotes about the area recommend any book of his	21
0	i love this show ! that said i do not care for this version of it the inclusion of the word concept in the title means it is just that this was thankfully not the final version of the show that would later spawn the hit song one night in bangkok with most broadway musicals the musical numbers tell the basic story of the show if you listen to the recordings of phantom mama mia beauty and the beast you can discern the basic storyline of the show listening to this particular recording of chess though will leave you wondering what was that \? the broadway arrival of chess saw a much needed reworking of the storyline and arrangement of the musical numbers this recording seems too much like a mish mash of songs that do n't really relate to each other for musical fanatics \( like myself \) i say yes you should have this recording in your collection if only to understand how much work went into the show before it opened on broadway if you are only buying the album because of one night in bangkok purchase the broadway recording instead you 'll be much happier with the performance by phillip casnoff rather than murray head	21

1	introduction i 've had this intercooler since it was released last spring and it has worked well and done its job my 360 is on for at least 3 days at a time with and without a game running here is the latest update from ign regarding the intercooler here are some facts 1 scorch marks \? this device was a hassle to make sure it was properly and securely plugged in all the way if you move your 360 a lot the cable can losen very easily the snap on of the power cord holds the power cord but it does n't make sure it is plugged in straight or not at a slight angle you can try this out yourself move your power cable around you will see that if you have a habit of moving the 360 around and not recheck the connect in the back it can be moved slightly to an angle what would this do \? it would most certainly cause major power issues you know how the end of the powercord looks like with all the holes that pins on the other end need to connect to you ca n't afford to not constantly make sure your cord connecting to the intercooler is nice tight and secure 2 loud noise \? i have a lot of old pcs in the house and if i ever do turn them off turning them back on would cause temporary loud noise coming from the fan this is due to dust and the ball bearings either wearing out or starting up with dust in the way is this a problem \? no because my intercooler currently starts up with a louder than usual noise but like my pc fans the noise stops within a seconds to a minute and everything is back to normal 3 how loud is the intercooler when it is brand new \? i don't even notice it my xbox1 makes more noise than the xbox360 intercooler moreover when you 're playing a game with the volume on you will forget you even have an intercooler running 4 stealing power from 360 \? this is rediculous what do you think the controllers and usb devices are doing when you plug them into the 360 \? supplying power \? yeah right these tiny fans use less power than plugging in your ipod or whatever usb device and controllers it 's true that microsoft has not publicly recommended this product but neither would microsoft allow a product that would damage their expensive consoles it 's microsoft who has to pay for the repairs shipping and replacement of these consoles microsoft would not allow a third party to develop hardware that would break the 360 100 of the time 5 what is this 100 of the time thing i just typed \? i do know for a fact that there are lots of faulty intercoolers i 've read about lots of exchanges on intercoolers actually my first intercooler never worked it never turned on i took it back on the same day and everything has been fine since if you have a problem with it do n't wait or let your intercooler continue to run just take it back and get a new one it 's onmly 20 bux the thing is made of plastic what do you expect \? it does however do its job i have never had my 360 lockup overheat or any kind of problems i have an xbox from the second wave shipment in december and it is on all the time ! recommendations please do n't have your 360 standing up that is just about the dumbest thing microsoft could have suggested take a look at your 360 and tell me where the largest and majority of the vents are \? exactly they are on the bottomside where you would stand your 360 up the nyko works better if those vents are not blocked it is extracting air and thus need more air to pass through even if you do n't use an intercooler please do n't stand that thing up i 've read more problems about overheating and disc scratching due to verticle 360 's how does it scratch discs \? think about it when it is released from the drive how does the disc stand straight up \? it is just released and it drops down to the slot that holds the disc and it does n't hold it in a perfectly level or straight up position that would allow the overly sensitive drive to pick the disc back up at the right angle	21

0	i do n't know how this skunk got 4 and 1 2 stars on amazon let alone one ! i could hear hepburn bogart and holden rolling over with a resounding boom i think this is mainly because of ford 's linus he is a very unsympathetic character in this remake the film critics said that while the original sabrina was about her transformation this version was about linus' transformation but here linus shows no transformation that you can really see his explanation to sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end there was a merger and you were in the way no hard feelings is very cold compared with bogart 's would you believe i enjoyed every minute of it \? in the original you get the feeling that sabrina gets the right man you do n't get that here at all	21

0	im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from visio to logic audio to ms office after picking up illustrator however im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people those who get vector graphic programs and those who errrr dont unfortunately after 10 hours use and much manual reading i fall into the later category i dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course this decision was supported by friends proficient in its use but who had difficulty demonstrating the complex concepts to me \( indeed defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science ! \) so my advice is this be extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before it may be a breeze to those well versed in its use but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it	21

0	melrose larry green 's book is full of quotes quotes and information used to back up points are good things he appears to have researched by surfing the internet watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others this is all fine and acceptable the problem with why the clintons belong in prison is when the author \( cut and paste expert \) attempts his own narrative which is sporadic jumpy and poorly edited his points are not linear and show the author 's attention deficit with a proper literary team this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a hit and run report and reads like a one sided sensationalized talk radio program	21

0	sounds like the background music used in the 70 's rockford files tv crime show and a little like the chips music too similar to music by tom scott from back then the crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky they are more smooth groovin funk the sound for the times is very clean too produced for true funkyness do n't get me wrong i like the old 60 's jazz crusaders just not this 70 's phase of their career they sold out to a large extent and continue to do so it 's where the money is no improvisatory feel either this is for smooth jazz lovers hard funk lovers will be disappointed as will true jazzers i wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60 's but they keep burying it like it never happened even to this day afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid late 60 's true jazz albums their 70 's albums like this are partly to blame for today 's smooth jazz in other words not really jazz not really funky just kind of smooth groovin more for casual adults and offices not challenging not offensive formulated to an extent but hey if you like this that 's cool just dont think it 's real jazz or real funk it 's smooth and casual slightly simmers pleasant background music but does n't cook like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz funk and fusion it just sounds like they are holding back i know they can play more advanced and write more creatively they just choose not to ever since the 60 's	21

1	this seat took us from complete refusal to use a regular plastic potty to be almost completely trained for starters kids like using the same seat as mom and dad this seat allows them to do that comfortably it is not too big and not too small fits any toilet and travels like a dream as the mom of a boy i do n't use the plastic guard because it sticks up too much over the seat but even for boys this seat is mess free and with boys there is usually a little mess but because it is plastic you can wipe it easily i love it and my son loves it i wish i had n't bought the potty because my son refuses to use it only this seat	21
1	i have purchased lentek bite shield because it is the only product i was able to find that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents i am used to i needed it for my daughter 's bedroom so i could n't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and i did n't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin lentek bite shild seems to work pretty well she got bitten only once the night i forgot to turn it on now i plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet that way i would be sure that the batteries would n't die in the middle of the night	21
0	i agree that this is technically an excellent film but it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with richard widmark 's character his enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism but in the end he does n't just lose he is literally thrown away as garbage and then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take all in all i was left with the question what is the point \? the commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well its basicly a description of what you 're watching while you 're watching it i see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so i 'll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie	21

1	'torz k' \( 'abandoned' \) is a brilliant hungarian film written and directed by rp d sopsits that takes us back to hungary of 1960 when the oppressive communist rule altered the lives of everyone especially children the quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring it may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure ron \( tam s m sz ros \) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father \( s ndor g sp r \) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters ron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother 's blindness by his friend atilla \( szabolcs csizmadia \) and the two bond emotionally and physically in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya \( krisztina somogyi \) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff there is one 'teacher' in the orphanage school nyitrai \( l szl g lffi \) who has been reduced to his position as an 'imprisoned one' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy nyitrai offers ron solace and introduces his 'fellow traveler' to the glory of the stars giving ron a map of the heavens that ron cherishes his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison like orphanage he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government hangs himself this horrid incident drives ron to organize an escape from the orphanage an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which ron feels responsible and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by p ter szatm ri defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period the musical score by p ter fejcsik tam s g rg nyi ferenc toma and bal zs winkler is some of the most beautiful composed for the screen making tremendously effective use of the cello and lower strings in all this is a brilliant piece of filmmaking acted with depth in every role and unveiling a portion of history and tragedy too often pushed to the background of our books highly recommended grady harp march 06	21

1	i was never a richard burton fan until i discovered this movie richard burton 's acting in this movie is top notch burton is able to pull you into his character of british agent alec leamas and make it all believable thankfully the movie is in black and white because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film the dvd transfer and digital 5 1 sound are excellent it 's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect 's could be so entertaining but it is the question is will alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him	21

0	at first loved it because the travel system with stroller is so light and does n't look doudy like other systems but the harness buckle is so difficult to fasten that the baby gets irritated before we even get to the car the straps never tangled but it is extremely difficult to adjust as needed the carrying handle has to moved up down with two hands a button on each that must be simultaneously pushed to lower the handle difficult to perform when you 're already reaching into the center of the car to even get to the baby yes it is a trendy color with the gray but it is not cotton and is not padded well and does not breathe ! it is horribly hot for the baby still love the stroller by combi but i never recommend the car seat to anyone luckily time to move 5 month old to a larger seat anyway	21

1	at tgs \( tokyo game show \) 2005 sony of japan announced that they were developing an original game for psp locoroco instead of the usual ports or re creations or compliations of retro games locoroco is a completely new venture it focuses on a fictional planet where happy locorocos \( yellow blobs \) and muimuis \( blue figures \) live one day it is invaded by the moja troop who eat locoroco your job is to tilt the surface to lead locorocos through their planet without getting eaten you collect flowers which gives you another locoroco you can combine and separate locorocos as well you collect bugs as a food source for locorocos additionally when you collect muimuis you can get house parts the game is very easy as a psp player of tekken dr complicated combo moves and annoying nuisances with the analog stick make psp games hard to play especially ports that we 're used to seeing on psone and ps2 with locoroco you use 3 buttons during gameplay the shoulder buttons \( left and right \) are used to tilt tapping the circle button separates locorocos holding the circle button combines them and holding down both shoulder buttons makes your locorocos jump a lot easier said than done a demo disc found at ebgames and a demo for download on the psp memory stick show these capabilities and can be found for download at http www us playstation com locorocopcdemo you must have v2 71 for this to work i might add besides a career mode which pivots you into different courses with different color locorocos there are mini games like a mui mui crane chuppa game and more you must collect a certain amount of bugs pickories every game to play these games also there is the locoroco house editor feature that allows you to create a house for your locoroco i have n't yet tested it out but it is an excellent feature i presume by collecting muimuis in games you get house parts and you can build a house for your locoroco besides all of the gameplay features a large soundtrack is full of bubbly interesting and catchy jingles with unique voices while some find it annoying it is very catchy and it gets stuck in my head locorocos even sing along in gibberish while the song goes on muimuis do as well the graphics are 2d like mario which make loading times non existant and shows off the capability of the psp 's high performance graphics in the end locoroco is a game that is intuitive simple and beautiful to look at it is fitted only for the psp and it should additionally the gameplay is excellent pivoting you into many different scenarios with many different characters \( like moja who attack you or chuppa who catapults you into hidden areas \) it is clearly worth 40 clearly pros intuitiveness and simplicity easy to play fitted for the pspshows off psp graphic capabilities beautiful to look atdifferent maps characters colors very unique and freshnot a port or re creation compliation a completely original gameno long loading times 2d graphics prevents thismini games lets you take a break from main gameplaycons longevity only 40 levels makes you wish for more should 've used characters more some characters pop up once you have to pay money made in career to access mini games5 5 fun5 5 graphics5 5 gameplay4 5 playability19 20 tota	21

1	i'm nearly forty and i'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight i got this cream and have been using it along with mbt trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer after one month i'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously lumpy legs i ca n't say that it would work wonders alone but as an add on to an exercise program it seems to be helping quite a lot i 've done weight loss programs before and they 've never addressed the cellulite issue this is the first thing that has seemed to work and it 's great moisturizer too	21

1	great compact design takes up very little room in your suitcase rollers heat up are ready to use in about 2 3 minutes like the product claims sets hair better then most rollers \( and i have tried many \) the only thing that i would change is to add 2 4 more rollers but i liked these rollers so much i actually bought a 2nd set use these at home over the 5 other sets of rollers i own !	21

1	first off i like this unit it 's easy to use and it does a fine job of taking your old lps and making cds out of them all you need to do is place a blank audio cd into the deck \( it does n't work with regular data cds \) hit the phono aux button followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the lp take it out of pause it starts recording instantly between each song hit a button and it break the recording into tracks pretty cool ! it 's got great potential but there are still a few shortcomings for example i was surprised to see that it does n't let you record off of the radio just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner was n't digital it 's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations you turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago i would n't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets this also makes the remote control somewhat useless too oddly the remote does have an am fm button they should just label it the radio button because when you think of it switching from am to fm or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re tune the station too using the dial another key point is that the unit does n't have any outputs at all so you ca n't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers i would rate this as 3 5 stars but since we ca n't use half stars i 'll give it 4 for one big reason for all it 's shortcomings it works and there are very few alternatives speaking of alternatives here are a few other options 1 a standalone cd recorder i have one of these too the advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck in my case my stand alone unit has two drives so not only can i record from any source in my system but i can dub from one drive to the other also my deck can make mp3 cds from regular cds \( it 's easier than using a pc however the song titles are just numbers \) in my case i opted not to use this for my lp projects because i no longer have a turntable i decided that as long as i needed a new turntable i might as well pay a bit more for this unit 2 crosley makes a simuilar unit but it costs a bit more and the reviews i read seemed to point out that although it looks better the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot 3 a portable digital recorder like the ikey plus i found one of these a few weeks ago and i love it you plug your turntable or other external source into it plug a usb storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality \( wav vs several mp3 sampling rates \) viola ! it records directly to your flash drive ipod or external hard drive if you do go that route make sure you get the plus model the older model is outdated and does n't work as well 4 use a pc even though it will give you the best possible sound and options it 's out of the question for me because i do not want to move my pc near my stereo every time i want to make a recording nor do i want to move my stereo next to my pc or bog it down while i'm trying to use it for that matter keep in mind that if you record your cds using one of the stand alone decks you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the cds you made into a pc afterwards then filtering the files with your favorite audio software then re burn the files to cd or mp3	21

0	the basic pilates mat exercises are performed which are okay however the cardio segment of this video is truly lame ! the instructor runs the viewer through marching marching and stretching one 's arm at the same time and finally marching and kicking back one 's leg that 's it how incredibly dull ! what 's worse the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration pilates for dummies is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates \( do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio \) i would n't waste your time w this video	21
0	i have been a subscriber to time for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about frankly the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story any future coverage is designed to prove time 's initial position correct the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories we told you so we told you so even worse the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story ca n't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn \? out of sight out of mind is the mantra in fact i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media newspapers are failing television news ca n't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis neutrality is dead frankly i do n't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states no more iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page african states are making vast strides towards democracy we get an article about nigerian computer fraud russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq japan one of the world 's most influential cultures in the week i originally wrote this review \( see 12 month subscription \) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein 's puerile take on pornography and social deviants but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks how in the hell did our world become boring \? can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer \? someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in depth coverage educate the reader about the world in which we live do n't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week time has the history and potential of being a five star magazine if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news	21
0	i have known canon to be a very high quality company however i was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations i had about this camera a few years ago i bought the fujiffilm 3800 i loved this camera but after a few ski trips i found it rather bulky i then bought the canon s500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the s400 for most of the pictures i take on a ski trip this camera is fine however if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime this camera is worse than a disposable camera first there is no red eye reduction it simply does not work when i set it to take flash with red eye reduction second pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry i would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod third night picture \? forget about it i tried to get a beatiful picture of the chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed so i tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and i could not get a setting that would produce non blurry pictures looks like i 'll be back in the market for a fujifilm after all the reviews i 've read i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop \( e18 lcd etc \) not to mention the terrible service that i have been reading about	21

0	beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop although microfiber mops are relatively new major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs in order to standout from all the competition five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews fortunately the reviews were fabricated about a month ago so hopefully not too many customers have been deceived my experience has been that most reviewers give helpful honest reviews	21
1	i have suffered from rosacia for the past nine years as i was fairly young to be starting through a change of life i had no idea what was causing my complexion problems not understanding \( or expecting \) what was happening to my skin i made many many mistakes during the first year or so trying to remedy the symptoms with countless products formulated more for adult acne or aging tired skin bad idea if you have rosacea or very sensitive skin you know that sometimes it seems that all you need do is touch your skin the wrong way and you break out let alone slathering some chemically based perfumed or exfoliating \( ground pits and the like \) product on your face this becomes especially discouraging when you are also beginning to see the normal signs of aging but sensitivities wo n't allow you to take advantage of some of the great treatments out there to nourish your skin and stay a step ahead of the wrinkles not to mention feeling starved for the moisture which is the real key to younger healthy looking skin after awhile i was afraid to try anything else so i just stopped i washed my face gently and left it at that well it only got worse and i felt like a dried up prune enter philosophy hope in a jar for dry sensitive skin it 's as if this product was made just for me now instead of people asking me what 's wrong with your face \? they ask what type of skincare do you use \? since i 've been using the philosophy skin care line i find i guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup something i had rarely done since my twenties since sun protection is so important philosophy offers a product called when hope is not enough with spf 20 for daytime which comes in a bottle but i have found that my skin responds much better to the hope in a jar dry sensitive formula then followed by philosophy 's seperate sunsreen called shelter spf 15 this is because shelter does not contain vitamin c or peptides and has a slightly lower concentration of sunscreens contrary to the spf 20 moisurizer combo you may be able to get by with the combination product and save a few bucks but the aforementioned ingredients in it do not agree with my sensitivities especially the vitamin c as for the much needed exfoliation dilemma try philosophy 's micro delivery peel pads or their peel kit both are soothing and non abrasive hope this helps and enjoy your new skin !	21

1	my 3 year old son loves this puzzle and has played with it for over a year he likes to put it together over and over again making a train across the floor it has really helped him to learn his alphabet and i highly recommend it !	21
1	i really love this system and find it has met all my needs my son receives only breastmilk and this system has made it so easy to express store and feed him with a bottle i have not found the liner cost to be a problem nor was i disturbed by how many kits i needed to buy i think i bought 5 or 6 to make sure i had enough it just depends on how much you 're going to need to store but you do n't need many actual bottles since the milk does n't have to be stored in them so the price evened out for me besides it 's much cheaper than buying formula ! i also do n't care about exact measurements of how much my son eats i can get the measurement just by lifting the liner out and taking a look but when he 's at the breast i do n't know how much he 's eaten so i do n't track just how much he has from the bottle either i just make sure he has enough dirty diapers i find the system easy to use because i can express directly into a liner put the bottle into the freezer then remove the liner from the bottle when it 's frozen this reduces the space needed when it 's feeding time just pop one of them into a bottle heat and replace the cap with a nipple easy !	21

0	this is the sort of book for paranoid people addicted to conspiracy theories they would rather believe a fanciful lie than the mundane truth though i do n't agree with most of what 's written in this book i do n't regret buying it it teaches me how to con ignorant people with high tech jargon and conspiracy theories if people believe that amalgams or metal restorations are the cause of their headaches fatigue or whatever symptoms then removing them will definitely cure them that 's how faith healing works the only reason why i do n't use amalgam in my practice is because i do cosmetic dentistry if the patient does not mind the colour amalgam is definitely a superior direct filling material for class 2 and subgingival preps i have absolutely no qualms about having that done for myself toxicity \? sure some people are affected by amalgams and anything can be toxic to somebody but let 's not forget that these cases are extremely rare \( perhaps less than 10 on this planet and most of them would be chinese \) there are literally thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe filling materials over the last 100 years there are numerous studies that show how safe amalgams are if dr breiner has been to asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles he may notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90 year old asian men and women who have gold and amalgam filled teeth in their mouths are composites totally safe \? the incidence of allergic reactions to composites \( very low \) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity this is something the author failed to inform us all his anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported by independent studies and sceptical parties not one case he mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam mercury can be very toxic but after tituration and amalgamation the metal remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body it 's different from inhaling mercury vapour daily injecting or ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds at the end of the day propagating such beliefs will only spark panic paranoia and various psychosomatic illnesses following breiner 's protocols for detox patients will only be paying a fortune for otherwise very simple dental work gosh with so many gullible patients in america i should probably move my practice to america and start doing amalgam detox instead of honing my skills for cutting crowns bridges and sinking implants	21
1	after reading the reviews i was hesitant however i 've gotten a perfect cup every time so far with my senseo the coffee is very good but it has fallen a little short of my expectations i 've previously brought kona back from my hawaiian vacations and ground it myself the pod coffee is not quite as good as fresh ground update for my next shipment this two cup style was backordered aloha island coffee co sent me the equivalent amount of coffee in single cup style pods instead i 've found these pods to work better fit the senseo machine better and this coffee now does tasted just as good \( or better \) than fresh ground whole bean kona ! i think the single pod style is quite a bit more expensive than two cup style but the difference is definitely noticeable	21

0	i bought this chair used and i do n't think it 's worth the 50 i paid for it i also have the fisher price chair \( i have twins \) and that one is so much better i wish i had 2 of those first like everyone has said it is ridiculous to clean those people who said it 's easy to clean must either not be really cleaning it or have babies that make very little mess gross food particles collect in every crease and corner especially under the seat most importantly the tray is way too high even at 1 yrs old my girls are uncomfortable reaching food on it and they are an average height weight the tray also does n't come close enough so there is a big gap between the baby and the chair not dangerous but perfect for all the food to fall through and collect in the sides of the chair and on the lap finally the tray is too big for an average size dishwasher so must always be washed by hand the fp high chair tray can go right into the dishwasher only buy this chair if the only thing you care about is how it looks	21

0	do not buy crunchies products in the hot summer months they are heat sensitive as the packaging states important store in cool dry area the two cases i purchased arrived chewy and clumped together they probably cooked during shipping and are not a raw food and not as nutritious anymore two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened amazon com does not accept grocery returns it was a waste of 40	21

1	first the story takes place in the 1940s \( harold 's brother is mia in wwii not in vietnam as the amazon com review erroneously states \) second the writing is superb mr lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel his characters are very real his setting \( a small struggling circus traveling the western u s \) is historically believable peopled with 'freaks' who suffer as sideshows unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with but peopled also with 'normals' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks harold the 14 year old albino central character tries to straddle both groups of people he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer i am admittedly ignorant about such things but mr lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants crucial to the plot of the novel seem believable my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end i do want you to read this book so i will try not to give anything away here but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character 's last words and even gomer pyle like \( people actuallly say gosh ! \) this did detract from the impact of the death unfortunately but i still very strongly recommend this book five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot !	21
1	after using my roomba for a year and loving it i decided to splurge and buy scooba wow ! i think i love it even more than my roomba ! i turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it when i return i have a gorgeous shiny clean smelling floor once a week i wrap a damp washcloth around my swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny all the time scooba is a miracle i did have a little bit of fussing with it right out of the box i had to prime the pump to get it going my only suggestion to irobot is to go ahead and include the instructions on priming scooba in the box instead of making people go to the irobot website to troubleshoot obviously from reading the reviews you ought to expect that the customer will have that problem fortunately that 's the only trouble i 've ever had with it ! i 've never had to prime again and it works flawlessly i'm very impressed with scooba	21

1	this grill cover is much nicer than the weber standard cover i have the 18 1 2 and ca n't imagine that the 22 1 2 is much different what i really like is the elastic pieces sown to the bottom that keep it on snuggly even when a little wind is blowing again it looks nice all black stitching virtually invisible and a nice weber logo after a couple nights left in the rain the grill shows zero signs of being out in the weather	21
1	though this is a portable grill it is terrific for at home use if you 're single or have a small balcony apartment it takes very little space and is easy to maneuver when cleaning time comes we took ours to a picnic this weekend and grilled two packs of hot dogs at once \( 16 thick dogs \) because the grill is small things get hot quick and you will need to be careful with easy to burn foods that should take longer to cook burgers do well steaks do fantastic chicken needs a a watchful eye i 've used this gem for years my apartments on the whole mandated the simplicity and efficiency offered up by the smokey joe a great feature is the rounded top this enables better smoking as air and smoke circulates more fluidly the downsides the legs are n't as sturdy as they could be given time a bit of bumping around and general abuse and the screwed on legs might turn askew if you notice this while the grill is hot you 've a problem the solution is to keep them tight during nonuse the air intake at the bottom gets clogged with ashes a key to good charcoal grilling is the manipulation of air flow the intake might be open but stopped up if you are diligent to clean the ashes you 'll be ok because the grill is so close to the ground you need to be careful unlike most of weber 's grill this one is also apt to getting kicked over run into by dogs cars and children i fully recommend weber 's smokey joe now i'm hungry time to stir the coals and pop on a few brats anthony trendleditor hungarianbookstore co	21
0	the only reason i'm giving this two stars instead of one is because i love benefit that being said this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper it 's so faint that you can hardly smell it but when you do it 's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better if you are looking for a young fun perfume stay away from this one it smells old and drab like your grandmother 's china cabinet or an antique store but if you like that	21

1	i bought a couple of these bodysuits because i thought that they were quite amusing the quality seems ok i have not washed them yet so i ca n't comment on the color fastness the dark blue seems a like it may fade the first thing i noticed was that the bodysuits are very long they are not the stardard length you get with gerber and carter 's etc the 0 3 mths has the length of a normal 6 9mth bodysuit the chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small in the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal i have to wait until my son gets here to decide if i will convert the smaller ones into tees this would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right hope this helps future buyers ! ! !	21

1	this disc dates from monk 's early period before he achieved recognition and started to descend into a long series of formulaic recordings for columbia so it 's valuable from that point of view it 's also a wonderful chance to hear him showcased without horns although the standard is perhaps not quite as high as the trio blue note recordings that immediately preceded it the best tracks both from a musical and recording quality view point are an extended blue monk which many consider the definitive version and a lovely unaccompanied just a gigolo which anticipates later solo masterpieces such as alone in san francisco sweet and lovely is in a similarly reflective vein much of the rest of the album has a forceful driving quality with aggressive use of dissonance in places even for monk a particular highlight is monk tearing through these foolish things	21

0	when i considered purchasing this product i was confused to see that some people thought it was great and others thought it was terrible i could n't understand why there were such discrepancies in the reviews after i bought it i understood for some of the things it does it works fine no problems however there are many major bugs in the software and if you need one of the buggy functions you 'll be sorry you bought it examples of some problems 1 if you burn an audio track entitled blue fog nero will give it the title fog 2 every time i run a backup it tells me there was a write error but the backup seems ok 3 i backed up every file on my drive but when my system crashed there were problems that prevented me from restoring my system 4 it has blue screened my system one time 5 many commands are poorly or not at all documented for example the wave editor has a declipper function but there is no documentation on how to use it so i 'd recommend that you look instead at a competing product good luck	21
1	actually have n't heard this cd yet i can still comment on part of it i was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the x ray cafe sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking i wonder if they ever did anything with those masters \? so i was there at the show and can say that every ounce of energy that the band put out \( which was considerable since this was the last show on their tour but they knew the x ray was special and gave it their all \) it was all captured on these recordings the machine was a tascam 688 that used standard cassette tapes for 8 channel recordings most all the mics were either shure sm57 58 but there was also a high quality shure stereo mic overhead that was mainly used for capturing the drum kit but also provided a nice stereo image of the stage the x ray was perfect for this type of recording the tiny pa was only used for the vocals so there was no competing with a pa blasting everything i would place a sm 57 close to every amp had a nice specialtiy bass mic too usually 8 channels was enough to catch everything but there were extra inputs where it was possible to stack multiple mics onto a single track if needed because of the overhead stereo catching the drums this was rarely needed with a full house such as the night with the gits any reflecting waves were just soaked up by the body mass of the crowd creating what turned out to be a very nice intimate recording space there was split box on stage which fed all the mics to the x ray business office next door which is where the tascam was setup away from any real danger all of which made it a fun gig to record in comfort and be able to also go over to the stage side and enjoy the show every once in a while magic happened d fletcherportland or	21

0	i am in great shape however i cannot get over that so many men 's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about 25 inches the idea of medium as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards my body fat is low i am not profoundly muscular bound as is common in men of my age lower back problems are not unusual i have a 32 waist is that not medium sized \? i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether one size fits all does n't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems the draw string is fine it allows flexibility so what if your pants fall down \? it seems to be the fashion anyway just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary uncontrollable constrictions also these boxers do n't hold up well to any kind of washing they looked like crap after the first time i washed them i wish i could get a refund because i wo n't wear them again my life partner told me they looked like old men 's underwear that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry i am not a mean hearted kind of guy so i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again	21

0	eugene o'neill 's play long day 's journey into night is a pulitzer award winning autobiographical play about his family i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater i did not enjoy reading this play the tyrone family 's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends no happy ending no hope for the future just despair long day 's journey into night is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without however after learning more about eugene o'neill 's background and the extent to which the play is based on his life i began to have a greater appreciation for this play o'neill did lead a very hard life therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill 's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner while o'neill 's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending it was appropriate for the play as eugene 's own family never got a happy ending i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family 's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal loving family the audience soon however gets the suspicion that something is n't quite right and that the family is tense slowly the family 's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth although i still believe long day 's journey into night to be thoroughly disheartening to read the reader 's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill 's exceptional writing	21

1	i enjoyed this game quite a bit i ended up putting all of the other games i was playing aside to just finish this one you play as the three baudelaire kids the story follows the 2004 lemony snicket film fairly closely as you must first escape count olaf 's decrepit mansion then avoid being killed by a train before you head off to uncle monty 's herpetology paradise aunt josephine 's seaside town and finally save violet baudelaire from a fate worse than death the environments are attractive and fun to explore and the game play and puzzles are neither too easy nor too challenging and frustrating for most of the game as you explore environments solve puzzles search for secret rooms and such you can switch between violet and klaus baudelaire as you please for many important events such as boss fights you must play as one or the other as they each have different skills and weapons for some sequences those that are basically 2d platformer sections \( the entire game has some platformer aspects but it 's usually loosely employed and 3d \) you must play as sunny the baby baudelaire \( and this is the only time you can play as her \) the various puzzles and challenges they almost amount to a series of mini games are varied and mostly non repetitive helping retain your interest some are fairly easy to figure out and perform but some are appropriately more challenging both mentally and in terms of manipulating the controller and take many tries to complete a couple first person shooter sequences \( the game is mostly in a third person mode \) are especially challenging particularly the end but that 's the final boss fight so that 's to be expected like most games winning boss fights requires discerning patterns in the bosses and adapting a strategy appropriate to the pattern which takes both brains and manual dexterity there are a couple negatives with the game but they are minor games like this released in response to the success of a film are often rushed through production that becomes evident here in the cut scenes which are not very exciting they feature 2d black and white sketches that are more like a slide show as major portions of the story are read to us but i 'd rather have skimping done in cut scenes than in game play and that 's just what was done here also although the graphics are wonderful for the most part the visuals are a bit dark overall i found it best to play with the lights off with a bright overhead light on the glare was too much to see important information in the game finally i would have preferred a different save game scheme as you can only save when the game asks if you want to and the save points seem almost random sometimes you can save after accomplishing only one more minor task sometimes you have to do long sequences \( and sometimes a number of challenging ones \) before you can save again the game is n't quite as funny as the film and does n't have exactly the same magical atmosphere but it is an engaging and fun journey to another world the soundtrack by jeremy and julian soule and inspired by thomas newman 's great soundtrack for the film is also a major asset i found myself wanting to explore levels again later on as much to hear the music again as anything else	21

0	reviewer alianore 's opinion rather too indulgent of its subject is a very accurate portrayal of weir 's work i will try to add something to that near perfect review \( note i listened to the unabridged audiobook of queen isabella 22 hrs on 18 cds \) the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable loaded with period details the last third is the worst weir 's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation nay elevation of queen isabella to the role of long suffering much wronged highly deserving and late redeemed just queen of england this book is really subjective rhetorical biographal dramatization i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis it is rhetoric because of the endless weasel words \( and expressions \) used copiously throughout some say it has been said many believe therefore we may assume it can be inferred this is n't just an attribute of her style it is her style comprehensively these expressions occur many hundreds of times commonly in conjunction with wier 's subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons equally irksome is weir 's double standard of historical psychological analysis she is always 'declaring' for us the contents of isabella 's thoughts remarkable gift she has for this many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful but then moments later she will portray isabella 's actions from a 21st century point of view always telling the reader how isabella must have might have could have would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history this is n't historical writing it is historical op ed with an obvious agenda i do n't loathe this work it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography \( other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris' rise of theodore roosevelt and theodore rex i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence yuck really \) if prefer more history when reading \( or listening to \) history and much much less editorial subjectivity retroactive psychology biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation the only way i could enjoy isabella by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly taking it with several pounds of salt as the above referenced reviewer advises 2 5 5	21

1	this is a good computer bible but for the money i prefer a program like amg bible essentials which has the libronix library system built in and can be integrated with other bible study software for about 15 more the amg program has both kjv apocrypha and nasb including a lot of other capability like greek translations word study exegesis parallel bible comparisons etc the rainbow bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above some benefits of this bible include both niv and kjv translations color maps matthew henry 's commentary naves and a version of foxe 's book of martyrs the various colors can be distracting at times but overall it is worth considering particularly if you like the niv	21
0	this record kind of sucks but that 's okay because it does n't suck in the way where you think quot oh hell we 'll never get a good album out of this guy again quot \( like for instance rod stewart 's latest garbage \) because i think it 's not really lou 's fault the problem is lou 's trying to draw his material from somewhere else in this case a mediocre poet we 've always been willing to overlook his \( poe 's \) considerable lack of talent \( example quot in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore quot \) because he 's so damn charismatic morbidly charismatic but charismatic nonetheless the danger is that too many people consider his pure dumb fun to be art \( which i guess makes him a lot like the rolling stones \) lou who 's always shown himself to be a poet but a poet with a wink has now chosen an artist who is basically bernie taupin with a better vocabulary to be his kindred spirit and from someone who velvet genius notwithstanding produced revolutionary and stunning works like transformer metal machine music and berlin this self effacing friendship is the real tragedy	21

1	definitely a wonderful book for those following the teachings of the other books this book provides more useful information the path that castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views \( read the other reviews \) i found it useful to read and judge for myself what castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon thus the angry reviews of those calling castaneda a fraud due to their own failure its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own 'specialness' jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book i believe castaneda 's genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated i am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom	22

1	thirty years later it is hard to imagine the story of adele h without the then twenty year old isabelle adjani as the title character but at the time truffaut 's decision to cast the young french theatre star was very risky not because there was any doubt about adjani 's acting but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful passionate and intelligent were rejected \? and could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer but truffaut knew what he was doing because adjani 's adele hugo is 100 convincing and rather than going for audience sympathy they go for audience frustration as the viewer is increasingly exasperated over adele 's self destructive behavior adjani 's breathtaking beauty actually is an asset as truffaut wants you convinced that the world offers unlimited possibilities for adele if only she can let go of her obsession adjani plays the character with such intensity that you are finally relieved when adele 's madness has reached the stage where she is no longer aware of her own suffering apparently adele had other issues before going on her obsessive quest for love her sister drowned a few years before and her parents had always strongly favored her sister adele has recurrent nightmares about drowning marriage and her pursuit of pinson are her only way to escape from her famous father truffaut 's stays with blacks browns and blues with much of each frame filled with shadows not exactly dreary but consistent with a character who has found little non fantasy happiness during her life the camera loves adjani a good thing as she is on screen for over 90 of the film she was the youngest nominee ever for best actress it was the best performance of the 1970 's probably no one but adjani could have conveyed such inner emotional violence it is that extremely rare visual performance that does not need subtitles or even sound as roger ebert noted truffaut finds a certain nobility in adele he quotes one of the passages in her diaries twice she writes that she will walk across the ocean to be with her lover he sees this not as a declaration of love but as a statement of a single mindedness so total that a kind of grandeur creeps into it adele was mad yes probably but she lived her life on such a vast and romantic scale that it 's just as well pinson never married her he would have become a disappointment then again what do i know \? i'm only a child	22

0	having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie antoinette but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual she depicts marie antoinette 's mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married but arranged marriages were the norm the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen of which there is little concrete evidence but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant it seems to me that marie antoinette loved children so much she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france if marie antoinette had been caught in adultery it would have been considered treason she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her with all of her enemies at court that was not a risk she would have taken if she had been so inclined on a smaller scale fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie antoinette dyeing her hair in all the pictures that i have seen of her her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it not that that is a big deal but it makes me wonder where lady fraser 's life ends and where marie antoinette 's life begins i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie antoinette 's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king especially since marie antoinette 's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor sadly there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language one can only hope that the works of bertieres chalon and delorme will soon be translated and published in english fraser 's book does have some interesting details \( aside from those which flow from her imagination \) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever 's travesty	22

0	normally i might wait to install a new software upgrade but i just got a new laptop and thought it would be best to use office 2007 with the new vista operating system i was wrong you would expect that a multi billion dollar company like microsoft could put out a powerful and bug free piece of software but after a month of using office 2007 you get the distinct impression that this software is not ready for public release microsoft should be ashamed i do n't know the root cause of my problems but i have to stress that i am running a clean install of office 2007 on vista so there should n't be any software conflicts or issues so what are my issues \? the list is long my biggest concern is that ms word constantly hangs and stalls it can making editing a document very painful i suspect the problem is when i put images or visio diagrams into a document but that is something the old ms word was able to do without an issue oddly if i have a colleague open the document and save it out in word 2003 the problem goes away ! what \? ! it 's killing my productivity when ever i cut and paste from an old document word hangs for 15 to 20 seconds and often the formatting and margins in my new document go haywire i keep having to spend a ton of time fixing things this never happened in the old word this is another time killer every few days outlook 2007 starts telling me that it cannot display my email folders uh oh ! i have to completely restart my computer to see my email again outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails that people send they look like a mess it is because outlook 2007 does not render html correctly since it uses the word engine not internet explorer to display email i have no idea why microsoft did this but they have got to fix it many of the issues in the old word 2003 still have n't been fixed if you place an image it can often be hard to get it to appear correctly why ca n't they solve this one \? while most office programs have the new ribbon interface \( which i like \) some programs like visio 2007 do not so you have to remember how to use two interfaces could n't microsoft find the time and money to update all its programs \? give me a break on a few occassions in visio 2007 my files have failed to save correctly at first i thought this must have been my fault but it 's happened to me a few times and ca n't be a coincidence a few times i 've gotten an error message and lost my work ug word and excel 2007 use a completely new file format so anyone you send a document to has to have 2007 installed \( which is n't likely the case \) to get around this you can save it down to a 2003 file format but then you end up with two files on your hard drive one in the new format and one in the old format what a pain ! also there definitely seems to be an issue with office 2007 opening older office 2003 files could be the cause of many of my problems but there is no way i can avoid using old files they should have worked harder on compatibility there are good things about the new 2007 i do like the new interface design and the new features in outlook 2007 are amazing for organizing tasks and sharing your calendar but i do n't think it 's fair that microsoft released a product so full of serious serious bugs that have cost me hours and hours of extra work i did n't spend hundreds of dollars on a beta product and do n't think the public should have to suffer surely they can afford to do better !	22

1	i gave my son a garmin 60c for christmas last year tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over it worked well of course i wanted one for myself but cash is cash so i 've been putting it off \( side note i wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring and when they went to get it it had been stolen from their car map pocket it seems these are high theft items keep'em on a short leash \) my wife had n't gotten me any big christmas gift so i told her i knew what i wanted and started shopping i debated between the explorist 500 and 600 chose the 600 with its altimeter and thermometer probably could have lived without them but hey it 's christmas ! it came yesterday so i charged it a bit and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover i had to go out to the street for the garmin to find satellites took it out for a spin today spot on navigation as i ran errands it tracked back almost to the exact spot i had marked for home though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate so it 's off by a few feet \( maybe it still thinks it 's in britain \? \) now why only 4 stars \? 1 \) the usb connector can attach to the unit either way there 's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go i called the 800 and spoke with someone \( in new delhi \) who had heard this a lot she told me what to do and the pc immediately recognized the gps file system as a removable disk drive as advertised i really find their website information near zero something as elementary as this should be covered on a website after the 3rd call eh \? 2 \) i bought the mapsend 3d topo software i am interested in elevations and it has detailed street maps but they 're not routable ! if you want routable streets \( where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow 's flight direct path \) for following in a car then either you have to get both map products or choose it 's rather frustrating and the sales information provided on amazon and the magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear it tells you what you can do but not what you ca n't and there 's no product comparison to see what the differences are on the mapsend topo box it says very clearly navteq roads and streets data like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems \( non routable \) er excuse me then it 's not quite like that found in expensive car systems is it \? i concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage \( on amazon and magellan \) more obfuscating than informative why ca n't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages	22

0	i purchased this product from performance bike to replace a much older \( 10yr \) cateye wired computer i have a certain amount of brand loyalty to cateye because their products are typically of higher quality \( almost always manufactured in japan as opposed to china \) and typically last a long time like the aforementioned 10 year old cycle computer i purchased this product without much hesitation but was disappointed with the unusually stripped feature set the cateye vectra is missing two critical functions ride timing and average speed features even my 10 year old velo2 computer has it offers only current speed max odometer clock and trip distance the overall quality of the unit is good and i'm sure it will last for years with the solid japanese construction but i 'll seek another unit because the missing features make it unusable for my purposes luckily the sender unit magnetic pickup is reverse and cross compatible with cateye 's other wireless computers i e it works with my older cateye cordless 2 computer also bottom line pick another cateye model and watch the feature set carefully	22

0	the oral b is a good product but the refills certainly are n't worth what they charge for them i do n't know about you but it has always annoyed me when you get held hostage by a company to buy their refills for the item they sold you at a rip off price they could make a great profit selling these refills at something like 2 50 each their rip off price of 8 50 ea is beyond absurd the other thing is that when you buy their toothbrush they have something in there like the brush heads last 2 months that 's a real laugh even brushing just once a day you 're lucky if you get a month out of them so not only do they rip you off with their refill cost they also lie to you to get you locked into their product to begin with	22
0	i read this short novel because i greatly admired shaara 's pulitzer prize winning killer angels and because i'm a baseball fan the novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher it 's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot the characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories the feel or atmosphere just is n't quite there any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away flaws that distract and damage the work shaara sets most of the novel in yankee stadium with the hawks playing the yankees why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear the hawks apparently are from atlanta but an atlanta team braves or hawks whichever would not be playing the yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season finally when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game he does so in the semi hidden bull pen down the left field line in yankee stadium not on the mound on the field this book was published posthumously and mr shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose prose that was excellent in killer angels it 's unfortunate there are glimmers of interest in the book but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author 's other book	22

1	i bought this glass for my wife \( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine \) as a christmas gift last night she tried out the glass with a friend the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch the wine from this glass tasted far far superior to the same wine from an ordinary red wine glass in fact they poured the remaining wine from the ordinary glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different superior one	22
1	it 's not a great movie but it 's a lot of fun this is one of those movies that just catches me it 's quirky and has some decent \( for it 's day \) effects there are a feww laugh out loud momments truth be told they are few and far between some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble the cast is pretty damn cool with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman angellica houston john mat mattus the big guy anyway it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot hey what do you want \? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been i still giggle at the time warp battle	22
0	i bought tendskin to help with the irritation and razor bumps i get on my neck from shaving the product claims to reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps ingrown hairs and redness from shaving but despite it 's lofty promises and high price it does none of this in fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse i have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol the directions tell you to apply it after shaving but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving it only made my problem worse i wish i could have rated this product zero stars because it is absolutely worthless	22
0	i purchased this to display mpeg movies \( which it says it can \) i was told by tech support that i had to use a divx encoder and that they must be avi \( which is also incorrect \) the sanyo xacti video camera i was using was mpeg 4 \( the ipod accepts the files without issue \) i tried converting them in quicktime to several different types of mpeg4 and none worked there are better frames out there and i intend on finding out which one is the best i have ordered another brand and will see if it works this was by first product return on amazon	22
1	my pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind he jumps to pull the beas out of the hive he squeaks the beas perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head he went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it it is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads he likes the wing detail for chewing on this toy gives exercise i am so glad i tried it he plays with the hegehog on his own those are the 2 best toys the squirels from the hide a squirel are fun but the game holder is not something he was really excited about these interactive toys are great i have never seen such excitement and tail wagging he hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise this one is the best it is well worth 10 for a dog who loves to play i get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys	22
1	i love love these earrings i bought them because i wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time unless there is something special then i will change for a special occasion but these earrings i wear in the shower they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold i received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date	22
1	i was amazed on how well this battery has performed i did make sure when i got it i did a complete charge and complete discharge and it has not let me down since i can shoot well over two hours without needing to change to the very meek battery that came with my camcorder \( sony hdr hc1 \) it is thicker and sticks off the back a little bit more so you can not get your eye up to the eyepiece but i use the lcd when shooting anyway and almost always on tripod	22
0	i was anxious to use this for my mother as she has a bad back however immediately after opening the product i tried to plug it in as it does n't work without batteries being fully charged unfortunately this massager would plug in but did not start charging and therefore it could not be charged i will be returning this item	22
1	i purchased this item \( not from amazon \) and my child loved it ! the puppet provides hours of entertainment and the music is great not the usual 'kid drivel' that usually is part of any kid item some hbb 's come with contemporary music and i will be picking up one of those soon highly recommended	22
1	i tried many other adapters and this was the only one that worked for my pda	22
1	after i read the reviews on this toy i wanted to cancel my order thankfully i did n't because my kids love it i have two boys 5 9 and they love bowling with this toy my kids have played with it since we got it in feburary in the reviews people said the toy broke soon after playing with it my kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems everything still works great the pins the sound and the ball return	22
1	these 3 discs \( there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out ! ! \) are a continuation of live dead if you have n't heard the dead live then start with this or live dead you will realise why to many they were america 's greatest improvisational rock band the playing the interplay between the musicians particularly garcia and lesh is staggering and how about a big hand for bill kreutzman on drums	22
1	this clock works great ! it automatically picks up the accurate time through radiowave it did not come with a product manual but easy to figure out all you have to do is selct your time zone button \( pt mt ct and et \) and put a new aa battery i agree with another review which mentioned that this clock is not made for durable construction as a matter of fact when i picked up the clock from the package a tiny screw came off it was one of the screws to hold back body panel to the main body it has not affected to the function as well as the visual part anyway so it may not a big deal overall this clock is good enough for the price	22
1	these cookies are so addictive and there is no lack of fudge on them which that is a plus other brand of their swiss fudge cookies is not as perfect as they believe it is the outside of the cookie does not blend well with the little bit of fudge they put on it keep making this wonderful cookie and i hope the stores will stock them again	22

1	this album grabbed my attention from the first measure thick and heavy this is not like any blues album i 've ever heard very atypical for hidalgo as well this one is probably an acquired taste one for the truly hard core blues fan the sheer uniqueness grabbed me from the start and the more i listen to it the more i like it i can only hope there 's a houndog 2 in the works	22
0	although it 's listed under the accessories section for the v66 it is not for the v66 well i guess it will work with just the phone but not the extra battery no sense in having this if it does n't charge the second battery i checked it out on the motorola site and in fact it is the wrong one this charger is the motorola spn5029 which does n't work with the v66 and 2nd battery the correct number is the spn4970	22
0	i never received this product so i can not review it i ordered it through amazon com and they never sent the magazine do not order magazines through amazon com i called customer service and being re routed several times i finally spoke to a customer service agent who said the magazine is on its way that was two weeks ago and i still have not received any copies of the magazine do not order through amazon com order all magazines directly through the publisher or any other way amazon com was a terrible experience if i ever recieve the magazine i am sure the first issue will show that i started receiving the magazine at the order date so i will have to fight with them to have my subscription end with the my first delivered magazine	22
0	we had it for two weeks then it broke the screen flashes on and off for no reason nothing happened to it it just started doing that very weird no online support available from fisher price for this system either i bought several games that cannot be played now the kids liked it while it lasted though we also have a leapster which has lasted us eight months so far my boys like it much better too ! ! so if you 're going to buy a learning system i would recommend the leapster	22

0	i have been looking for a good cheese plane and this one is n't it it works fine for rubbery semi soft cheeses like swiss but not for harder cheese like cheddar which tend to crrumble before i can finish a slice the problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid it should be thin and flexible also do n't let the name fool you this utensil is made in china a country which consumes very little cheese	22
1	i have a 2005 ford ranger i bought this unit and fully read the instructions before starting the install after that i began searching for the right connecitons on the steering column and connected up the unit i went online to find the correct placement of the wires and downloaded a printout the unit installed well worked fine after initialization came with a video that really helped in the installation i find the range on this unit to be super i have no complaints	22

0	when my son was in a convertible car seat which was tilted back slightly and had head side wings this pillow worked well it was propped well enough to support my son 's head when he took a nap but when we had to switch him to a straight back booster seat that had shallow head wings this pillow was not usable at all	22
1	i use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream cookies cakes etc i find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated to obtain this i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk	22
1	this light refreshing fragrance is a classic and you 'll use it every day the simplicity of this cologne gives it a style all its own	22
0	due to the fact that you ca n't give 0 stars i had to choose a 1 otherwise it would have been a big fat 0 ! ! ! we bought this mattress when i was pregnant thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong a couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers no toys nothing sharp etc well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night and my husband and i go in to see what is the matter and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out my poor little one had the springs poking at him after further examination we found that under the vinyl is a thin and i stress the word thin layer of foam then cardboard piece and then the coils what a joke ! carboard ! ! ! ! needless to say i went out today and bought him a much better better constructed simmons mattress i should note my son is only 17 mths old and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths do n't waste your money you 'll only have to buy another one down the road take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby ! ! ! afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do ! ! ! from a mom who learned the hard way !	22

1	the controls are a little complicated to get used to especially the all manual settings which should by definition be easy to use but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable after i bought it i took the d10 to budapest hungary i had a great view of the danube and set my camera up for night shots it did a brilliant job how about this take a digital night shot \( use the largest image size possible \) use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through shutterfly com image remained amazingly sharp colors were fantastic the camera made it easy to look like a pro the only gripe i have with this camera is that i wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive canon digitals but this can be overcome with software so it 's not a huge issue the price is great it has a magnesium body \( vs the rebel 's plastic body \) you get a lot of the d1 d20 d30 without the cost	22
0	i bought my canon a95 in november 2004 a little after 1 year just after the manufacturer 's warranty expired the infamous e18 error struck i called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate and they quoted 89 plus 8 shipping handling i bought the camera for 300 online now it 's going to cost me roughly 1 3 of its purchase cost to repair it for all i know it might break down again after the repair ! the repair comes with 90 day warranty period but it could break again after 90 days and then there is an upgrade option canon offers a program where you can upgrade a95 for a610 for 125 plus 10 shipping and handling this comes with only 6 month warranty again it could be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires i would really do extensive research before buying another canon	22

0	i am returning my roxy safe seat ! it was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door the material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat at a grocery store the seat just fits into the whole cart and i have no room for groceries its not worth the hastle i admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy the seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place sorry graco the idea was good but the carseat is awfull	22
1	do n't let the size fool you i do n't know much about audio yet but i can tell you the sound recorded from this mic is wayyyy better than the usb microphone headset i was using much crisper with out all the fuzziness and i did n't spend nearly as much as the online gurus were recommending i am sure the 600 mic is great but this is doing every thing i need	22
1	i have been using lush products for a few years now first introduced to them when i was in australia i always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases try all of the bath bombs i use the tisty tosty whenever i need an evening of self indulgence put the water on and watch the heart shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail place some dr haushka 's oil to heat by a radiator pour a glass of champagne surround the tub with lots of tea lights put on some rahman music get in and imagine a private ganges when you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals take the pre warmed towels and wrap yourself in one by then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body i also like to put some bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels if you have n't tried the karma soap do try it alone or with someone special	22
0	i have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest however i was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow advil i used sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help but nothing seemed to work the taste is n't bad and i used the bleach with my own trays that i had made by my dentist so it did n't leak out or touch my gums my teeth were n't sensitive while i was using it or even right afterwards but later in the day if you have sensitive teeth i do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain	22
1	i ordered this bra as well as the olga women 's perfect fit full figure black 38ddd this bra provides much better lift support and separation than the olga i think it is because the cups are seamed i 'd recommend it to any woman who is petite in stature \( i'm 5'2 \) and also has a large bra size \( i'm a 36ddd \)	22
0	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	22
1	the watch looks great prominent yet not overly large the orange really sets off the look the large luminescent indexes are easy to see long after dark i also like having both day and date complications and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than 300 \( way less on amazon \) is really a find you will need a pro to adjust the bracelet though as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler 's tools another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day overall i really like it it 's become my daily wear watch	22
1	i really liked this product i am a late 30 's woman whose skin is basically pretty good i have occasional mild breakouts and some blackheads but even before i bought the neutrogena microdermabrasion i would receive compliments on how smooth my skin is but around age 35 i looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle age dullness to it unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion i decided to try the neutrogena at home system the neutrogena microdermabrasion cream is easy to apply the cream had the slightest pleasant smell and was not sticky at all i used well less than a teaspoon so a little goes a long way it was no problem to rinse it off my face with water and the sponge was very easy to clean as well the treatment took me less than 10 minutes fit in easily to my bedtime routine and after the initial start up treatments you only need to do it a couple times a week my skin definitely felt softer smoother and more invigorated i could notice a difference after only one treatment but the real proof came from the way my husband did a double take a couple days later and commented that i looked younger \( he did n't know about the microdermabrasion \) and even my 6 year old daughter told me my face looked pretty there was a clear and noticeable difference after only a few treatments my middle aged dull skin had definitely gotten back some of its youthful glow and the few large pores i have did appear smaller being lazy i have not incorporated it into my regular routine like i should but i do pull it out a few days before special occasions vacations or anytime i feel the need for a little brightening up and will definitely always keep it on hand if you have particularly sensitive skin this may not be a great product for you as it is a bit well abrasive for me it was a painless process and i would highly recommend it to anyone looking to give their skin a more youthful glow	22

1	this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market in my opinion because it has excellent production values i e luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions as a bonus the writing is superior and highly imaginative an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band in addition this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well known here in the usa as they are in uk often these are bands that we might want to know better the reviews section is always great and usually the magazine will highlight a mini section e g 'best r amp b albums from the 1970 's in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists this magazine will have you finding buying and liking albums by bands you 've never heard of and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price	22

1	this clock is great it 's really modern looking and i love the black face i have this in my kitchen and it looks great there is a second hand which is invaluable in any kitchen the fact that it 's an atomic clock is super because it means that i never have to reset it for daylight savings time because it resets itself automatically shortly after you plug in the battery the clock starts setting itself to the atomic clock and that 's kind of fun keeps precise time	22
1	the caribou population is declining at an alarming rate and the canadian government is concerned after a harrowing and kind of funny plane flight with tundra pilot brian dennehy government researcher tyler is dropped in the frozen middle of nowhere it 's a `kind of' funny plane flight because it 's so well done dennehy is a hung over buckaroo bonzai type independent flyer his little prop plane heavily laden with tyler 's \( charles martin smith \) equipment has a tough time both taking off and later staying afloat the in flight repairs dennehy makes had me on the edge of my seat although the photography is the great strength of never cry wolf the acting especially by smith and the editing are also nearly perfect as harrowing as the plane ride is it 's a pretty safe bet the plane will land \( elsewise there 'd be no movie \) and tyler will find survival rather than research is the pressing order of business tyler is there to locate a wild wolf pack kill one or two of the pack members and dissect them to discover if as suspected their stomachs contain an inordinate amount of healthy caribou meat tyler laden with crates of light bulbs and toilet paper is materially and constitutionally unprepared for setting up a research station on his own fortunately for him he 'll be discovered rescued and befriended by two inuits the ancient ootek \( zachary ittimangnaq \) and his adopted son mike \( samson jonah \) as tyler notes in his voice over narration there are no orphans among the inuit ootek and mike will arrive and disappear a few times a wolf pack will be found and tyler will learn that man 's relationship to the wolf is many times more complex than he imagined i dislike most message movies they tend to distort characters and events and beat you over the head until you accept their point of view never cry wolf has a strong message about man and nature but it 's such an entertaining movie i did n't feel like i needed to join the sierra club to enjoy it the story lines are clear and after the plane trip its plentiful humor is quiet and unforced smith who spends an awful lot of the movie alone acting under his voice over narration is nuanced and convincing jorah and especially ittimangnaq are both good and both add a layer of authenticity to the film and the photography is at times breathtaking never cry wolf is a gem	22
0	this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help it is very tempremental and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement so a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so	22
1	it does work very well once you decide on the best ceiling mount location i had to remount move once to get the laser beam to hit the spot on the car dashboard that we wanted it to when the car was at its desired parking position the forward backward adjustment of the laser after mounting the unit is helpful but not being able to adjust the laser side to side after mounting scored it a 4 instead of 5 star rating from me	22
0	no no no ! ! ! dvd technology is for quality image and movie collectors this time artisan did not pay respect i think it 's the worst dvd in my collection bad transfer full frame and etc	22
1	i tried another rotisserie i got from an auction and was sadly disappointed the mounting brackets did not fit there was no counterweight and the meat forks were cheaply made this unit however is great first the mounting brackets are truly universal and should fit just about any grill mine mounted perfectly on my aussie bonza deluxe 3 grill without issue installation only takes about 5 minutes the mounting brackets allow for various distances between your grill 's mounting holes and multiple sets of holes allow for various height adjustments if your grill has two holes on either side you should be set the single piece spit rod is heavy duty the counter weight included is heavy enough to assist with balancing heavier roasts \( or chickens \) and the four pronged meat forks are well made the motor comes with a long cord \( about 3 feet most other units have much shorter cords ! \) and the fact that the motor has an on off switch is a nice plus lastly for all the praise i can give this unit i was also pleased that it 's attractively priced i have seen many other rotisseries that seem to be much more expensive and not built nearly as well	22
0	i originally read the novel \( of which i assume most of the other reviewers are unaware \) and watched the earlier german film of the same name for a college course entitled memory and mourning in post war germany i 'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel it seems that the director wanted to make a more hollywood version of the film and i think he succeeded for instance the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story in general the film has little to do with any of the original versions and is far inferior	22

1	this one caught us by surprise ! we do n't know of any other pod maker that has this flavor and it 's really good ! we love the way it smells the way it tastes and the fact it is just plain different most pod people are ignoring the flavored sector to this extent and it 's nice to have a cup of really flavored coffee meaning a rich flavored cup of coffee is hard to come by and this one is very good singleservecoffee co	22
1	this product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the uk as a great teaching tool it was well received as a gift by the children and their parents an excellent math teaching tool that the children love it is portable user friendly and has something for those on many different levels so much so that one father an engineer loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son as well as a game that they can play together math whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge	22
1	finally ! i 've been looking for a good bust enhancer for several years these enhancers are well shaped and incredibly comfortable when ordering go ahead and get the b c size even if you are an a or low b these inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up i personally recommend using a fashion forms pocket bra style 9400 or a playtex style 4300 order a cup size above what you would normally wear	22

1	the binoculars were suprisingly lightweight for their size and power the 70mm lens were great at light gathering and the 4 75 mm exit pupilprovide more light than most adults can use \( the avg is 3 4 mm \) with a good strap is easy to wear for long periods and excellent for long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use you really need a tripod to use the full power effectively but for short periods those with steady hands can enjoy the binocs on the fly	22

0	we were extremely disappointed with this toy that we bought as a christmas present for our four year old son the parking garage came with pre drilled holes and needed to be assumbled unfortunately due to poor quality the pieces did not line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in order to make the toy functional it would also have been helpful for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case they got lost or destroyed during assembly	22
0	i ca n't believe how many people gave this awful movie good reviews the premise is absurd namely that anybody would even think about giving up three or six years of their lives to live in a hideous torture cell just so some friend that they barely knew in the first place wo n't hang preposterous in itself for smoking some hash my advice to joaquin phoenix would have been sorry pal but get a better lawyer a ridiculous storyline that wasted some fine acting talent	22

0	this worked great for a couple months then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise the gears must be slipping my poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move then gets scared at the loud clicking popping noise and starts crying really sad	22
1	these earrings are quite nice yes they do look brown up to the light but they are a definite red when backed with any type of shadow they can be worn to accent an elegant look or add style to a friday casual look they may not be heirloom quality but could last quite a long time in the modern costume jewelry category	22
0	for the most part this is a good toy it was actually one of the easier items i took out of a box this week \) my daughter \( 4 \) loves it and as long as you can tolerate the mommy daddy the wing fell off can you put it back on \? every 5 10 minutes then it really is good i guess if your child is old enough and has the dexterity to put the wings back on by herself this toy would be great	22
0	this toy is a terrible disappointment it falls apart immediately is very poorly designed and ridiculously difficult for a child \( or adult \) to put together	22
1	for some reason the electronic control panel does n't work on my bike but i do n't mind too much the bike is small and light but has enough mass so it does n't slide around i use the bike while doing work watching tv or reading it 's a great way to get exercise on rainy days	22

0	the other day i excitedly tried this bra on at walmart i could n't believe i could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims depending on the company i am a 38 dd or 34ff i tried this bra on in a 38 dd i was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support basically under a shirt i sagged as if i was wearing no bra at all that is not the effect i want when i go strapless only goddess seems to have the ability to create full figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety	22
1	this are excellent and i can dry my suv with all three easily after a few wrings with each towel they begin to get too wet to dry efficiently i definitely recommend it for the diy car detailers	22
0	it is obvious that this movie is full of lies although i have not actually seen it i know this to be true because i have seen many discussions on the movie on the fox news channel \( god bless them ! \) the way he attacks poor mr heston is deplorable ca n't michael moore tell from the comments charlton made at the rallies that he does n't have his faculties about him \? i am also unsure that mr heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying the ability of hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing making it appear that my president \( heston \) is an uncaring babbling idiot by simply using his own words shame on you michael ! and as for the way he got the gun from the bank i agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they did n't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank bravo to those who figured that out also michael moore is fat take that pinkie	22
1	came quickly and was exactly as offered i am completly satisfie	22
1	if you like beatles monkees and the who then you will like the group that is better than all of them the rascals ! lonely too long is a sad rock pop painful staple in your 60's elbow it hurts then theres all this other good sh here and i don't mean groovin ! the harmonys and the killer keyboards and tight drumming in these little pop angry yet cheerful nuggets is where its at ! i can remember listening to the rascals intermitently with black sabbath and the stooges and i realised that above all i liked my rascals record the most back in 1987 up in that cold lonely bel air gardening cabode ! also known at times as 'the young rascals' but to me this band will always be the one from way back in childhood that got me listening to queen and the who later on its hard to say that they are underrated since in any given conversation you realise the rascals get tone of respect and people will take over and talk about them five stars buy this thing	22
1	this movie is all about entertaining the combination between die hard and typical martial arts flick works in many levels but the production values are hong kong`s don`t miss that point fans of jet li are welcome but action fans be careful here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames exploding building models chopped off dummies you name it the characters are extreme in their own context jet li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor loyal gentleman honorable deadly you know a portrait of the typical good guy the bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking he does n't fight or kick much in this film but he shoots a lot dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator that happens to be be the right size well you have to be in the right mood to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish production mistakes but if you are into hong kong low production values action films you will really enjoy one of the best ones of the 90`s by the way this dvd edition sucks english dubbed subtitles poor sound and no extras not even a filmography	22
0	i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security now i regret buying one since ive installed it it slowed my computer its very very hard to close window and worse when i disconnected from the internet i have a hard time logging off everytime im on the internet i get mad and upset its not worth all the stress i definitely dont recommend this product now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to norton	22
0	i wish i could give them 5 stars i got these to replace a pair of new balance 999 that i had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around 170 should be really good i could n't be more wrong the lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day ! ! ! stay away at all cost	22

1	i am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best pack n play on the market when 3 came along we needed to purchase a new pack n play the graco pack n play with bug toys is absolutely the best we 've ever owned the bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old she has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings she actually gets excited about playing in her pack n play and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption ! and best of all it is so much bigger than the other pack n plays there is plenty of room for her to play without rolling over the top of her toys the set up and take down is super easy all four sides break down very easily and it folds nicely without any hassle i am also a fan of the much thicker play mat that fits into the floor of the pack n play i never worried about her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning to sit up overall i ca n't say enough wonderful things about this product ! i 'd put it on the new parent 's must have list for sure	22

1	i am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch i purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall winter mix cilantro basil parsely thyme savory sage and oregano the parsely and sage are from the new french herbs kit everything i 've planted either sprouted a day early or right on time the savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since i started the sage grows very quickly and is more robust than even the basil the parsely seems to be slow but steady your herbs will be good for at least six months with proper care i'm sure you could extend their life these are very easy to care for and it 's great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal i recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past	22
1	great little case we have two i like the inside pocket for extra memory battery	22
1	that nigga 's crazy and bicentennial nigger both surpass this album in laughs but it would still rank high if it was n't for the poor sound quality there 's a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly than pryor himself half the time but some great classic bits and believe me you 're never bored	22
1	i was pleased to find this item at amazon i purchase the identical product at a well known national chain b c i wanted to protect at least the driver's seat of my vehicle i liked it and later decided to order another one when i saw it on amazon the item came securely packaged and the quality is the same as the one purchased in the store the gecko design really is quite cute if you're into cute that is and i find these covers quite adequate at prolonging the seats of my car i would recommend this item	22
1	venom is one of those movies i thought i would hate because i heard so much negativity about it but i really enjoyed it being a fan of the 70 's and 80 's slashers i crave newer versions because i have seen all the other ones over and over again venom did not disappoint me it starts off with action and never lets up i found it to be one of my favorite new horror slasher flicks the voodoo angle was good but not overplayed i'm simple in that i want to see a killer with an axe machete butcher knife etc not a bunch of supernatural mumbo jumbo i do n't want to have to wonder was that a dream or was it real ! ! as so many movies these days play off of give me an old fashioned slice and dice and i'm in heaven and venom gave me that so i hope to see venom 2 if so i'm there \( for the record mr jangles used the hook chain before kane in see no evil \)	22
0	made another bull album honestly i did n't hear this whole album about 5 years ago i was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd oh my god for the first time in my life i wished i was deaf i see the reason why her albums sell though cause its her looks and nothin else she 's not ugly at all to me she just ca n't sing but she can livin up a crowd i'm just waitin to see her and 50 cent doin a song together two of the worst people in music millionaires go figure	22

0	my cyberhome portable dvd player worked for all of 1 day it is unable to play dvds or cds of any type also if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs it will completely drain out within 24 hours i attempted to get service from cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty their support number is unreachable as is their support email address attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful this would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked purchase at you own risk check out the manufacturer web site you have been warned	22
1	carson mccullers one of america 's greatest southern writers was often misunderstood as many people were put off by or unwilling to deal with her \( at the time \) controversial subject matter mccullers used the grotesque as exaggerated symbols of everyday experience the loneliness and isolation of her gothic like characters were merely extreme examples of feelings we all have though magnified and intensified to the nth degree tennessee williams in his introduction to mccullers' reflections in a golden eye posed the question \( in a mock dialogue \) most people asked about writers of the 'gothic' school such as carson mccullers flannery o'connor katherine anne porter and eudora welty why do they write about such dreadful things \? williams replies in my opinion it is most simply definable as a sense an intuition of an underlying dreadfulness in modern society why have they got to use symbols of the grotesque and the violent \? because a book is short and a man 's life is long the awfulness has to be compressed mccullers unlike any writer i have ever read pierces the heart of themes such as love isolation and loneliness with her lucid poetic prose tennessee williams in virginia spencer carr 's biography of mccullers summed up mccullers' writing as follows i have used the word 'heart' but it is not an adequate word to describe the core of carson mccullers' genius i believe in fact i know that there are many many with heart who lack the need or gift to express it and therefore carson mccullers is what i would call a necessary writer she owned the heart and the deep understanding of it but in addition she had that 'tongue of angels' that gave her power to sing of it to make of it an anthem	22
1	this was by far a great program and never had a problem with it loading on our computer fast installation and very easy to work with plenty of available online over the phone or program tutorial help ! awesome program even comes with a tshirt and 2 transfers	22
0	i think this may be a great product and is why i bought it however mine never worked \( and hence was never actually used it was just taken out of the box ! \) the remote would beep the collar but not spray seller did have manufacturer send new batteries \( which further delayed my getting a good response to this situation \) new batteries arrived item still did n't spray but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer to get a replacement even though i responded within their advertised 30 day return policy please read seller information and return policies carefully ! even if you get them to take something back \( only if never opened if opened and does n't work they toss you to the manufacturer \) there is a 25 restocking fee ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! pretty exorbitant and not amazon type service i have come to expect over many years of buying from amazon ! be very careful of sellers that are not amazon sometimes it is n't very clear it is not amazon my feedback on seller is on feedback page and seller responded but i do n't get a chance to respond to their feedback which gives the misconception that i actually used this product ! i could n't have used it as it did n't work ! if you want to buy this i 'd recommend a reputable pet store such as pet smart where you can easily take an item back if it does n't work and get a refund even if they are willing to replace something you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two and would want a refund which most stores have no problem with doing for you next time i go the established pet stores	22
0	when my house painter could n't figure out how to use the nozzle he somehow took apart the hose and lost one of the parts i looked everywhere on line for a replacement part but could not find anything finally i called hozelock in new york and they sent me a replacement part they charged me about 6 for shipping a part that cost about 3 the system ca n't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler also it is hard to reel the hose in overall i do n't think this item is worth the cost if you need to call hozelock their number is 1 800 297 7461	22
0	i bought this drive in late 2003 and it 's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then the positives first though it has an 8mb buffer it is very fast and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers it does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig wd 's and the newer seagates 2 5 years after purchase the drive started corrupting files like crazy wd has tools on their site to check your disk status and sure enough it was due for an rma when i checked the warranty status online 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my warranty period the drive warranty had started 6 months before i 'd purchased it ! anyway it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick still this is my second wd drive to die and i'm going with other brands from now	22
1	i would have given it 5 stars but my gerbils chewed the house up within a week or two and now after a couple of months they no longer have ramps currently they 're working on chewing up the shelves so i'm off to buy one that 's entirely wire wish i had done that in the first place	22
0	i was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when i got this soap but sadly that 's not what happened the smell is a very strong herbal like the kind you would add to an italian pasta dish not very appealing ! there is some complexity to the scent but it 's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through on the plus side the color is beautiful \( a rich dark purple \) and the lather is equally lovely to look at if you like true herbal scents then you should give this a try it just was n't for me	22
0	i ordered these white tank tops and 3 colored tank tops i have never received these white tank tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither i have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve	22

1	beautifully done kids discover issues are packed with information on one specific subject \( ie volcanoes the civil war \) my daughter is 8 and a good student she uses these magazines as reference texts more than as casual reading material i think these magazines would be enjoyed most by parents and students between the ages of 10 to 14	22
1	i'm still learning to use this camera and all the features so far it is amazing i 've been taking pictures of the kids and it looks like a pro did the shots i use the auto mode a lot and it works great the zoom is amazing i love that it tells me when i am focused also it has great battery life i'm very happy with this camera	22
0	i bought this camera like 7 months ago since it was so small and i liked the design but the pictures it takes suck specially in the night time or with flash you can barely see what you are photographing the video feature its ok even though you cant change the zoom while making the video but the design doesnt suit well this feature since the audio in is in the exact same place where you are suppossed to hold the camera so most of my videos dont have audio since i was blocking the audio entrace its small and portable and i could fit it in any pocket so thats good but its so small that the battery lasts only aorund 90 min that 's what it says but it keep going down like 5times faster than a regular min so it only does last like 30 min	22
1	tim mcgraw does it again it is a great album with some really great songs a must have	22
1	we started with dr brown 's when my daughter was just three weeks old she 's now 10 months and have loved them from the very beginning we 've used them both for breastmilk and for formula and they 've been great for both we 've never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting up episodes and i give all the credit to the bottles they 're comfortable for me to hold light enough that even a young ish baby can hold them on their own and easy to fill the cleaning is a bit of a pain more parts than in other brands of bottles but it 's worth it and we have n't found that dr brown 's leaks any more than any other brand definitely give these a try they 're great	22
0	not sure what to make of the movie but it is definitely not one of the best movies and not sure if it is even a movie	22
0	i was hoping for a little bit higher quality but you get what you pay for i gues	22
1	i subscribe to entertainment weekly premiere and any magazine with a photo of johnny depp or hobbits on the cover but scr \( i \) pt is my favorite magazine every issue of scr \( i \) pt has articles by the screenwriters of movies that are just opening explaining something about how the movie was written and featuring excerpts from the screennplay of that movie these are triply helpful as they \( 1 \) provide insight into how a successful screenwriter works his craft \( 2 \) supply brief examples of what the movie you just saw \( or are about to see \) looks like on the page and \( 3 \) are a useful tool in deciding which movie to go see saturday night each issue also has articles of the more general how to variety although these range from how to write great scenes characters to how to pitch to studios to why studio execs are using your script to wrap fish for a while there was a series of articles that were simply a compilation of all the genre cliches written in the hopes that if you knew what they were you could avoid them they were invariably hilarious these how to writing advice articles are often extremely funny \( this is not meant as an insult they are meant to be funny as well as helpful \) finally every issue has the news on sales contest winners and whatnot that is essential for any working screenwriter with a generous helping of heartwarming success stories to keep your spirits up while you 're waiting to hear from the studios i highly recommend this magazine enjoy	22
1	any game that gets my husband dressed up in a tiara and earrings while playing a board game with his girls is a great game ! it 's simple to play for anyone over age 3 \( unless the child is orally fixated there are smaller pieces so use your better judgment ! \) is fast enough to hold a child 's \( and adult 's ! \) interest and let 's everyone relax and not worry about rules we really enjoy it and are wearing it out pretty quickly it has been a great gift for other friends as well as it 's not too well known	22
1	these earrings are so exceptionally shiny and cute the are a nice size and look very well made a couple of small drawbacks the pointy edges of the sunshine 's rays are kind of sharp and also the hook part seems to be extra thin because a normal small rubber back does not fit and will slide right off but if you wear the earrings without a rubber back they will slide out and you will lose them \( i know this because i had to backtrack in the grocery store only to find my missing earring in the produce section ! \) they do provide a rubber back that fits but it is so very very tiny that i could easily lose it and it 's hard to handle with fingernails but do n't let those things stop you from buying these earrings because they are so distinctive and attractive i always get lots of compliments when i wear them	22
0	i purchased this item a few weeks ago to mainly kill fly 's it seemed that this was n't happening as there were fly 's still around and no evidence of fly 's being killed at night there would be a lot of flying bugs getting zapped though the noise would make you jump every time it scared my labrador retriever to the extent she would not go outside after dark the final straw happened when a young squirrel laid dead underneath it with no marks on it at all i could only figure that it had got zapped i finally switched it off and hung up some zip lock bags with water inside now there are no fly 's and no interference with the ecology of our garden	22
0	it 's always good to see an artist change and try new things back in 2003 when jewel did it was a big deal everyone accused her of selling out which i think is unfair this disc while different is just not what i would call jewel at her best i found america somewhat enjoyable and run 2 u was also but the rest of the cd did not sit well with me i did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 cd goodbye and i must say it 's jewel slowly regaining her musicality also glad to here that she will be making a country cd next it will fit her voice well	22
1	the book is complete brand new and i got it very quickly after the order even with the free shipping service in addition the price is pretty good for the book with such a good condition	22
0	eric maibus and scott bairstow have become fine young actors and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal pointless lurid and sadistic movie dee wallace stone should be ashamed for participating maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult with no conscience morals or regard for anyone but himself bairstow plays the usual quot misunderstood quot teen who looks to the group for acceptance the script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence enough is enough if this is the way teens talk then steer me clear folks there is no heart or soul in this movie and no reason to rent or buy no stars c'mon amazon when you gonna give us the 0 stars options \? \?	22
1	one of the best films of all time ! fans of katharine hepburn and cary grant are in for a treat with this one	22

0	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	22
1	'zulu' opens on january 22nd 1879 with a pacifist missionary otto witt \( jack hawkins \) and his blonde daughter margareta \( ulla jacobsson \) attending a zulu mass marriage ceremony the impressive dancing and chanting takes on a different tone when the preacher discovers that zulu forces have massacred hundreds of british troops at iswandhlwana and are determined to destroy rorke 's drift an army outpost in addition to being witt 's mission station the shaken reverend arrives and explains the situation to the british officers advising an immediate evacuation to his horror the officers decide to withstand and defend their ammunition dump with 139 welch infantrymen a mixture of committed soldiers and complaining malingerers the haughty arrogant lt bromhead \( michael caine \) is in charge but lt john chard \( stanley baker \) of the royal engineers on assignment to build a bridge takes command actually by strict seniority the situation becomes dramatic by the fact that chard has had no combat experience and on a distinguished level he is obviously not from an aristocratic background but urgency obliges the two officers to set up the defense of the station deploy their men tactically and prepare for the attack then thousands of zulus armed with short spears and captured rifles arrive on the grassy hilltops their unseen advance is announced by a threatening chanting and then they come into sight long lines of black figures descending the green slopes of the hills promising with the terrible clash of their shields and spears that soon they are going launch a fearless attack their techniques of tribal warfare fashioned an efficient and terrifying fighting force they begin to test the british firing power with the life of their warriors the british rifles cut them down and they retreat but they come again and again and again each time getting closer to the station cutting down the distance every withdraw is followed by a deathly silence it seems obviously that any of them will survive in every disciplined attack they are less in number and ammunition after a long night and at the rise of the sun the fearful noise suddenly alerts the redcoats to another charge most of the men in the infirmary were too sick or injured to help few are malingerers like private hook \( james booth \) who decides much later to take his bayonet and fights heroically in hand to hand combat with dozen of black warriors inside the burning building outside the exhausted soldiers prepare for what must be the last charge but instead they hear a massed yell from the zulus a salute of acknowledgment to the braves as they withdraw from the scene the battle at rorke 's drift was a decisive one in the british campaign to pacify south africa for european settlers who came to force their culture upon the angry natives as a page in british history it has the distinction of being the battle which produced the victoria crosses in few hours to eleven defenders for their extreme courage an all time record for one military engagement stanley baker is solid as the engineer who is forced to become a combat commanding officer michael caine splendid \( in his first major role \) as the pompous aristocrat james booth good enough as the guy who can easily find a reason to check himself into the hospital patrick magee excellent as the calm surgeon and nigel green a sergeant of the old order sternly watchful and understanding of his men but compassionate as in the last move when he lines the tired and dispirited survivors up for a head count he looks at them and quietly advises 'keep your voices down ! 'the film is a superb account of that bloody engagement and the fighting is shown in realistic detail it salutes the heroism of the zulus and the extreme courage of the redcoats cy endfield 's direction gives emphasis to the physical exhaustion of nonstop killing and the effect it has on men making some tremble with great fear more significantly he avoids any explanation about the racial nature of the conflict keeping out politics and history with john barry 's menacing musical score zulu was filmed in natal south africa and stephen dade captured the luscious colorful landscapes and the sense of strange isolation but the most arresting moment in the film is when enfield 's camera pans over a field carpeted with black corpses gathered side by side or one on top of the other	22
0	please sid with the dissapointment of civiv and now railroads say you have n't jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers sid the reason we purchase these games is because your name is on them this game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who 's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards you created after this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account	22
0	do not buy this iron it 's fabulous while it works for which it does merit the one star but it broke in less than a week it overheated or something and then would n't turn on again but here 's the kicker if you buy it from amazon the company wo n't honor the warranty i do n't have particularly heavy duty hair this is just totally unacceptable	22

0	investment banker with a conscience ben hartman and special agent anna navaro 's plot lines and bodies soon become intertwined in their quest for the secrets of sigma an elite cabal with roots in nazi germany that is bent on world domination what starts out as reasonable and entrancing enough genre pulp becomes sheer bond by the end but there 's no denying ludlum has a gift for keeping the heat turned up from page to page if you are new to espionage fiction and have even slightly literary sensibilities run do n't walk to writers like alan furst graham greene or even john le carr but if strong characters are n't a necessity you are able to suspend your disbelief and you are lusting for pure literary sugar you probably wo n't be disappointed ludlum is a great author for those who typically spend hours in front of the television and tremble in anticipation at the release of the next hollywood blockbuster because he provides essentially the same experience in written form he is a master of the wildly oscillating plot line but barely approaches apprentice status in any other literary area i found myself cringing in embarrassment for the author at many points but to his credit i was compelled to continue turning the pages until i had reached the end it 's like candy you ca n't stop eating it but feel ill once it 's gone if you are a die hard ludlumite i admit this is my first foray please point me to a better example of his work if one exists otherwise i 'll invest my time elsewhere and catch up on mr ludlum by proxy when the next bourne film comes out	22

0	i like to have natural sounds or some type of 'yoga style' music while i'm either practicing yoga or just trying to relax this cd just did n't fit there are a few ok 'songs' but the rest of it is either too fast upbeat or there 's too much talking chanting i found myself distracted when i put this cd on	22
0	i walk pretty much the same distance daily and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route i could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride etc but off by thousands of steps \? hardly worth it	22
1	do n't listen to the uneducated reviews here these are great for hitting the heavy bag speed bags focus mitts etc the length of these 108 makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves the 170 180 are for sparring and competitive bouts that is why ringside makes different lengths there is also a 120 length which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps	22
0	the game itself is very interesting the storyline is engaging and the controls are unique it 's an rpg which is quite a switch for mario the major problem with this game is interactivity not enough of it specifically there are far too many cutscenes that are not skippable many of these cutscenes lead directly into a boss battle the most frustrating instance of this is just before the final boss battle it takes about 10 minutes to get to the real fight from the prior save point this is n't a problem for the first time through the sequence but if you lose 4 or 5 times this just becomes a hassle and makes the game not really worth playing to see the end this is a major problem that most game designers have found work arounds for but nintendo revealed its lack of rpg experience in this element it 's an interesting game but just make sure to win or have a friend sibling \( enemy \? \) skip through the dialog sequences for you if you get tired of them	22
1	this was a lot of fun its big and different from my golden 's other toys and it makes a really unusual sound not a squeak but a honk if you will the problem came when my golden took to destroying it and eventually ripped out the honker this is of course inevitable with these toys so be prepared to supervise your dog 's short playtimes with this toy and to mend it several times to extend its lifespan	22
0	it 's got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might have had the good unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving the bad some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story	22

0	i purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better i was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly unfortunately i do n't have the original box therefore cannot return the item i am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from one step ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box through friends i have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that i wo n't be disappointed hopefully babiesrus will sell this other item in the future	22

0	i do n't know what 's up with all of these 4 5 star reviews this movie was awful there was no plot and the movie just seemed to drag not even the guest appearances by afrika bambataa melle mel and the rock steady crew could save it i could n't wait for it to be over with the graffiti throughout the movie was absolutely awful ramo and his girlfriend were too white to have a baby that dark with curly hair guy davis was fine back then but not anymore rae dawn chong was just annoying this is one movie i never want to see again	22
1	i had to replace my space saver b d on a sunday morning i wanted another thermal carafe model but was n't realy ready to shell out 80 for the braun even witht the good reviews i found this on clearance at target for 35 and i bought a cuisinart gold filter for it i did not like the fact the mr coffee filter had a solid bottom to the gold filter anways there is not much i can say bad about this machine things i like looks brew seletor self clean feature makes good coffee the carafe is one the best i have used the easy change water filter disks are a nice feature as well inexpensive and work pretty well i dont have any of the leak problems things i would change could make coffee a little hotter but not a deal breaker the unit beeps 5 times when finished brewing not a big deal when everyone is up and moving but i tend to set it to go on before the family is up overall for what i paid for this i'm very pleased	22
0	1 \) i ca n't 2 \) on second thought it deserves at least one star for having some silly funny stuff that you do n't find in other magazines that said it is grossly overrated how is it consistently in the top sellers list \? well there are as many millions of folks with a below average iq as there are above average it 's too bad they ca n't play up the silly humor a bit more while leaving the abhorrent juvenileness out the images are generally trashy and sometimes airbrushed to the point that it looks fake and ridiculous they could improve the quality of the photos a lot admit it you would probably hide an issue if you ran into anyone you actually respected does n't that say it all \? reconsider the standards you are setting for yourself and respect your own brain too	22
1	we have this product and love it ! at first we had a problem with the hooves not working i called the number on the box they were wonderful and sent me new hooves at no expense or item return then i find it was user error ! santa did n't realize there were buttons in the heel of the hoof that push down when walking i called the company back and they told me not to worry about the exta hooves they sent to enjoy i would order from them again	22
0	like the other reviews i find this game a rip off of caesare iii \( i did n't know there was a iv ! must look into that \) while the graphics are admirable the gameplay was n't challenging at all it did n't take me any time at all to win and i'm one of the worst game players ever otoh it 's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals do n't buy it now wait until it 's cheap like 9 95 or something	22

0	i 've been a digital artist for 5 years and always loved and supported paintshoppro and corel products i have to say i am very disappointed in the new version pspxi no problems with the download but the program crashes easily you can not drag and drop as fast as in 9 basically is slower in everything you do i am a photographer and looked forward to the new photo features which work but for panoramas and complicated work others than one photo forget it just hangs up and so slow you could go have dinner in between i have searched the net and support wise the upgrades and patches have not helped corel is not solving the problem and maybe they ca n't this is not a pc problem which they so want us to believe i have plenty of memory and speed on my pc it may be something involving how the xi stores it 's cache not sure but the changes are not workable sadly i think there are some corrupt files or driver problems that corel desparately needs to fix and supply us with or they will find themselves out of the ps market this is not just me talking it has happened to alot of loyal fans because it could be the better than photoshop if they fix it if you really want the program download the free trial first and or try the x or 9 version especially if your pc is an older model	22

0	the lotion does not get very warm and only the lotion in the uppermost part of the dispenser gets warm so if you want to use a lot of lotion you have to wait in between while the lotion warms up i have dry skin so i put lotion all over its more of an inconvenience to have to wait for each application to warm up and even when it does warm up it is n't super warm	22

0	mark twain once said that \( and i paraphrase \) the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read that is my experience with this book for some reason a tale of two cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists and i figured it was one of those books i should have under my belt so i picked it up what a slog ! a book that might have been fascinating due to its french revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama we were supposed to shed tears for sidney carton a character who you barely get to know and root for lucie manette the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness the only thing i liked about this book was how madame defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge an admittedly cool concept maybe this book speaks to another era maybe it 's past its prime maybe i do n't have the required literary sensibilities or maybe i could n't relate but a tale of two cities bored me to tears	22
1	i really like having this it 's odor free and easy to use yes you have to empty the bags and that takes time but it 's worth it i have found refills at walmart petsmart and petco so they have n't been hard to find	22

1	i like the 05 version better sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function but it does n't appear to me ea sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter i was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe i was expecting too much i wo n't buy the 07 when it comes out i 'll wait and see what they can do with it on playstation 3	22
1	video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems that has been the case with one of the biggest selling ones of all time gamepro they truly have made it one the most provocative and well in depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works the magazine is quite well but i honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for gamecube and game boy advance when most of it primarily focuses in on playstation 2 xbox yet gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer 's magazine anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games this magazine is worth reading overall b 1 2	22
1	i am not trying for a show quality shine just a nice clean car and drying with spots was always the issue for me outside the 6 wash i liked this i washed and watched dry two cars and a motorcycle in just the time it took to wet wipe with soap and rinse with the no spot setting worked great for the price	22

1	wow i just viewed spun the other night and i thought this movie was outrageous this is sort of a guilt pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards spun has an impressive cast of recognized actors the film is essentially about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts there is the cook \( mickey rourke he truly makes this story worth watching \) who makes the drug \( speed \) and sells it to spider mike \( john leguizamo \) a dealer with a junkie girlfriend cookie \( mena suvari looking infinitely less attractive than she did in american beauty \) one of his clients is ross \( jason schwartzman \) who does a lot of favours for the cook and his girlfriend nikki \( brittany murphy \) i was surprised at how funny the film was at times it does n't drown us in anti drug messages nor does it become one of those equally tedious drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party the humour is dark certainly but funny nevertheless a lot of it comes from a subplot about frisbee patrick fugit who is caught by a couple of tv policemen \( peter stormare and alexis arquette \) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get spider mike i will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead this is a film with a lot of energy that seems like its characters not entirely sure where it is going but determined to get there and quickly although i am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too the director jonas kerlund has directed music videos in the past and it shows in his impatient filming style as he plays around with animation speeded up camerawork and such like i'm not recommending the film for its style though although i am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen i am recommending it because i liked the main characters which i think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens i can imagine an entire film about the cook and nikki or spider mike and cookie or even just ross who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours days what makes spun better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community and we feel as if we are watching their everyday speeded up sleepless lives simply amazing	22
0	house of mirth is one of the most depressing movies i 've ever seen to be clear i 've seen movies like oh say schindler 's list or the heart is a lonely hunter that treat tragic events either in the macrocosm or the microcosm that did not leave me depressed rather they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think house of mirth deals with tragic themes including human society 's ability to destroy its own and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites it was n't though moving or thought provoking i was n't moved by gillian anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor i did n't believe gillain anderson 's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor rather i was bored i kept wanting the film to go faster it 's a great irony edith wharton 's novels are real page turners quick to the point hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality house of mirth has gorgeous clothing and sets i did n't care about anybody onscreen though i did n't believe anybody onscreen i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces as if to prove these points people are hypocrites see ! people are insincere see ! if a person has any decency at all that person is destroyed see ! i would tend to agree with all of the above points so why do i need to watch this movie \? also as a woman who as lily bart was meant to has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that i felt that this movie no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally betrayed lily bart lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film she all but participates in her own destruction you want just once for her to show some initiative some intelligence some ability to create her own fate the film denies her those abilities in this crippling of lily bart the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does movies like gone with the wind that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning and occasionally gaining some power imo are much easier to watch one might argue that such films are not realisitic i do n't know even we real life lily barts have our resources and our triumphs and again watching lily bart in house of mirth slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine	22
0	i was intrigued by satan 's little helper due to several things namely its halloween theme which i'm a big sucker for and the heralded return of jeff lieberman to the horror scene lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70 's and 80 's the last one being 1987 's remote control you would think that lieberman with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return well it almost feels like lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80 's due to how cheesy trashy cheap and godawful it is many myself included look upon the 80 's slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be the plot revolves around a 10 year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game satan 's little helper it 's now halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume which he wears proudly one afternoon he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house he becomes enamored with the tall mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper the two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy \( whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5 year old than a 10 year old \) inexplicably thinks it 's all still a game of make believe if you think the plot sounds bad that 's nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed nearly everything about it is god awful from the camcorder film quality to the laughable gore effects \( including the least ever convincing intestines i 've ever seen \) and especially the acting the 10 year old boy who appears in nearly every scene makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory the acting on just about everyone 's part is bad and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason the flaky sister and the eccentric kooky mother there is not a single character we can give a darn about and we do n't care the least bit when someone gets killed granted dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen but these ones truly take the cake i'm a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews i'm thinking some people are going to put this in the so good it 's bad category but i'm not having it some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be funny such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman an elderly lady and a stroller carrying a kid are downright appalling the villain himself is a bad joke as he does n't utter a single word throughout the film instead delivering thumbs up signs to the kid and wagging his finger cheesy \? heck this film is cheesier than a black diamond factory satan 's little helper comes across as the work of a first time wannabe horror amateur with no budget not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker to sum up how i feel about this film i will repeat a line that i see all over amazon that i usually feel redundant but somehow i find to be entirely fitting for this movie do not rent or buy this garbage ! !	22
0	i flip through time every now and again at the barber shop sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists for the most part since time receives most of its revenues from big business advertisements it ca n't challenge the establishment as it needs to so instead i read magazines like z utne mother jones the progressive the sun earth island and the new internationalist	22
0	after carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on amazon and reading all reviews i had hoped i had made a good choice with this cd unfortunately i discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5 1 system and my bose tri port headphones as a recording engineer i recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de coupled from the ground the bottom line is i hear this rumble each and everytime i start to relax and it renders the cd completely useless to me the recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic since nobody else has complained of this rumble i will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear	22

1	i love the new digital canon the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin i had the camera less than a month when the pop up flash quit working the canon people have been great and very helpful but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory the photos however are wonderful film quality for the most part printable and enlargable \( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos	22

1	the pedometer is just too sensitive ! ! it tends to over state the number of steps that i have taken i like the item but i cut the number of steps that i have taken by third so if i am tageting 10 000 steps a day i try to go 13 333 so that i can be sure that i really hit my target the item itself is well made light weight and easy to use and set	22
0	i was looking for a pair of roof prism binoculars like this for hawk and bird watching i had looked at swarovskis but they were way out of my budget nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution these binoculars are crystal clear with sharp focus the 42mm lens lets in lots of light lots more than the 35 's i 've been using i wear glasses and the twist up and down eyecups are a blessing there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm nice because i always used to lose them for the price these ca n't be beat	22

0	the product is fine but the description is misleading each package contains 40 count that is 40 filters but this is not a \( pack of 12 \) as you would think from the description from the price reduction \( from 23 88 to 1 93 \) and from the shipping weight \( 4 20 lbs \) it 's just one box of 40 filters and you 'll pay as i did 11 for fedex to bring you this one box soon after i submitted this feedback i was issued a partial refund of 7 product description still needs correcting but at least customer service was responsive	22
1	i love these crackers for several reasons they are absoutely delicious to begin with and they do not use ingredients like partially hydrogenated soybean oil they are hard to find in stores it 's a hit or miss thing here in the northeast so i ordered from amazon propmpt delivery and ease of purchasing will keep me coming back	22
1	we have gone through a few packages of the table toppers and we love them ! our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive and she does n't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating we finally found the shopper toppers at toys r us and i was so excited i bought two packages and they do n't work worth anything ! the adhesive on those is down the sides not across the top where it should be to stick on the shopping cart handle in fact we 've decided that the table toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart also with only a shopper topper in our bag while out for lunch recently we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table ! well done	22

0	i have the same criticisms as many others i had to put on rubber gloves to open the battery compartment after turning it off after the first use i could n't get it turned back on again and returned it to the store i loved the size but i bought a nice wireless by microsoft not a mini but easy to use a battery compartment that opens without difficulty and a nifty little snap in receiver that turns the mouse off automatically take it out put it in the usb port and the mouse is back on again price was comparable even though i pay a lot more for these items living in the caribbean amazon does not ship anything but books cd 's and dvd 's to the caribbean	22

1	i watch cnn too when there is a big story i get parts of it on cnn then newsweek comes and it fills in with a larger story the bigger picture in a way that i understand then i relate to other news sources as a more informed listener reader if it in fact has a liberal bias i have not detected it but i tend to have a slightly liberal bias myself so i ca n't speak to that i buy time on the newstand when there is something that seems to be particularly well covered in time i do not consider newsweek lesser i used to take time years ago now i prefer newsweek the only complaint i might have is that both magazines seem to be having more magazine or feature type stories that i do not see as news and am not interested in i think that is driven by these magazines \( both time and newsweek do it \) attempt to find out what works in this expanding world of media ninety percent of those human interest subjects are not my interest and that annoys me but the few that speak to me yes i will buy a magazine for that for instance if time has a good article on the older groups of people in america i will buy that single issue at the same time i am usually disappointed in whatever is featured in either magazine if it is not news driven newsweek has been my news magazine that comes in the mail for years for me it remains my choice mary p jones	22

1	if you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game it is as if you are the star of the film but that also means that there are many cut scenes these cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic but there are those of you out there that do n't liek cut scenes at all if this is the case for you reader do n't buy this game if you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you ca n't go wrong with this game i have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price it is that good if you like cut scenes	22

0	for indesign to not have one basic features everyone i know still does french folds but in order to see double page spreads in indesign you have to lay them out wrong in the program then you have to painstakingly go through your document and shift the entire document by one page layout by layout this is mortally stupid at this point adobe should have figured how a tool like i d is actually used in conjunction with a printer not just assumed the user wants to print what they see on their screen the oversight is the difference between avergage klunky desktop publishing software and a great layout tool why is n't there a button that toggles me between the layout view and priont output \? why do i have to slave over a document like this \? adobe stop thinking in the abstract and investigate how your software can facilitate printed results also who knows how you get an alpha path or clipping path into this \? mine shows me a heavily pixelated entirely xparent bw image when it supposed to be a cropped color image what do you want me to do with that	22
1	i forgot the toy needed a battery so for the first few days my cats played with it without the bird moving around in circles but mostly they ignored it when i got the battery and the bird started moving my two older cats were n't impressed but my youngest \( about 1 1 2 years \) went crazy it 's pretty funny watching her with the toy she can get fairly worked up attempting to take out the bird it 's also entertaining when she 's finished playing she has a tendency to walk away from it too slowly which means she is hit in the backside by the bird naturally this starts the fight with the bird all over again i'm pretty sure the other cats will play with it as well but even if it 's just the kitten it 's worth the money	22
1	if you are looking for this to be very accurate then you need to use the lithium batteries because of the cold temps here the cheaper batteries do not work as well maybe where it does n't get in the minus temps the rayovac batteries will be okay but not here in ne the sensor needs to be put in a location that is out of the sun and out of reach of your pets and children which makes for a little decision making time on your part	22

0	microsoft continues their legacy of software that does n't work i 've been using windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems microsoft has released you would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this instead it is many steps backwards btw i have a 4400 amd 3 gigs of ram and can say that vista is slow slow slow be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on xp cool interface about the only positive thing about vista i have found so far searches are also much faster but hardly a reason to upgrade be prepared for windows updates after installing vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working i'm tempted to go back to xp so needless to say a big waste of time and effort	22

1	this pedometer is easy to set up and use i tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1 2 mile and sure enough my pedometer read 1 2 mile the clip is sturdy i have n't had any problem with the device falling off the leash is a good extra if it did fall off it would n't hit the ground my doctor gave me a goal of 10 000 steps per day so i wear this all day long it is light and i do n't notice i am wearing it throughout the day the only downfall to this device \( as is probably true with others \) is that your stride is measured for walking so when you are running or doing other cardio activity \( elliptical \) it does n't accurately measure your distance since your stride is longer during a cardio activity \( running \) and the device is measuring your walking stride the distance measurement falls short however the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured i suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap	22
1	i have had this product for a year now when i first purchased it my wife thought it was another of my goofy gadget ideas but after a few nights with it projecting on the ceiling she grew to love it the projected image can be rotated and focused and even without my glasses i can read it in the dark \( and my eyes are n't that good \) it will not be visible when the room is lit it is great to be able to read the current time and remote temperature in the middle of the night when you wake up out of the box the radio sync 'd clock easily picked up the remote sensor \( for another oregon scientific clock we have \) on the back porch and synched to wwv in colorado within a few minutes over the last year it has performed flawlessly except for the time when we had to change the batteries on the remote which required a reset of the mother ship a tip when you change the batteries on either the remote or the base clock change both sets if the unit does not show the temperature after changing the battery reset it using a paper clip in the reset hole i also have the lacrosse projection clock in our other house and this oregon scientific model is a superior product i believe to the lacrosse equivalent	22

0	people were talking about this movie as if it were the next silence of the lambs there are several reasons why this is not so 1 the dumbest cop in the world this character never calls for backup and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues at the end he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight he 'd never survive on the sopranos 2 it 's sooooooo 1998 this movie assumes you know nothing about the internet 3 it tries to be cool by combining bdsm body modification and rituals but in the end it just makes all these things look bad 4 it 's inconsistent the dee snider character retires all his piercings for a few years and then suddenly they 're all back in the next scene 5 it 's unrealistic where the heck did snider get that second dungeon from in just a day \? 6 i wo n't even get into the gaping plot holes the acting pretty bad the dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood grumpy amy smart is totally wasted in this movie snider 's pretty good though actually he 's really good really bottom line you have only two reasons to buy this movie 1 you are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a twisted sister tour bus through them with room to spare 2 you 're a snider fan and you must own this if you belong to one of those two groups go for it for sister fans they 'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song captain howdy street justice you 've been warned !	22

1	nancy drew last train to blue moon canyon \( 13 \) before i begin my review will be spilt up into sections and have a in depth look at that topic if you hate reading medium long reviews or just do n't have the patience i would not continue reading but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you 'll continue gameplay interfacethis is a point and click mystery the arrows and hands are simple and easy to use they also have made and improvement in the arrows since the last game the hands manipulate items or add them to your inventory \( toolbox \) when playing the game you also have a panel at the bottom of the screen including a inventory \( depicted as a toolbox which i think should be a backpack instead \) a camera cell phone and a journal help and a menu button \( other games have a coin purse when money is used in the game \) the main menu is pretty simple however the loading and saving a game is a little clunky and you ca n't delete saved games it also prompts you about your decision it makes saving rewriting games take more than one click for this type of game the interface is perfect but i 'll knock off a star for the irritating save load page plota fairly used plot in this series finding treasure but her interactive made this treasure finding story a little more interesting jake hurly a miner and owner of a custom built train falls in love with a young french woman named camille on the way to finding gold camille later dies jake possibly finds treasure but he is nowhere to be found and his now haunted train is found out in out in the nevada desert with the engineer dead many years later lori girard \( daddy 's little fame seeking rich girl \) finds the train and puts it back into shape for a trip to copper gorge colorado she invites infamous guests along on the train to find out what happened to jake hurley and where his mine is using the clues jake left on the train a pretty simple treasure story \( this series often uses that story but in different ways \) now turned into a intriguing mystery good work her interactive the game also has some side mysteries like lori getting kidnapped and someone throwing an emergency brake \( both happen to be publicity stunts \) but you find who did those things only minutes after each event happened what i did n't like was there was not really a culprit because there was no crime committed the very end is when a crime is attempted after you find out who the culprit is the jake hurley part of the plot was fantastic but the sub plot \( s \) were n't very exciting charactersi loved the characters but you could n't really interact with them as much lori girard was one of my favorite characters i loved watching that dumb blonde trying to get publicity and how she always kept forgetting nancy 's name since lori is the hostess she was probably the main character tino baldcucci is a great character as well he is a private investigator but all he really did to get such fame was being at the right place at the right time he is as conceited as lori you 'll probably interact with him a lot more than john grey john grey is the first black male to be in this series he is the host of ghost hunters a cable show on the verge of cancellation about ghosts he 's a pretty good character but not a leading role unfortunately then there is charleena purcell a romance novelist introduced in nancy drew secret of shadow ranch \( 10 \) who is nice and very smart she is in the process of making her book that 's on a deadline who you 'll find out used one of lori 's story ideas in her latest book without permission i like her better now then when she was in nd 10 to bad she has no memory of that game and finally there is frank joe hardy these teenage brothers work for american teens against crime \( atac \) and who were invited because their dad was friends with lori 's dad the boys were nice enough to invite nancy along as well i personally liked this addition to the game because you get to play as frank as a short order cook they really do n't have much to do with the case they are just a good source of info i am looking forward to playing as them more in nancy drew creature of kapu cave \( 15 \) i really did n't like how there was not a lot of character interaction in this game but when you did interact at times it was really fun that 's something to add to nd 16 and beyond setting graphicsi love being on a train the feel was so exciting seeing the scenery pass by in the windows were great the cars were so detailed and beautiful i think my favorite place in the train was the projection car later you stop at copper gorge a little town in colorado there was the mysterious crypt and a museum taffy shop that was cheesy but enjoyable the crypt was small and there was n't much to do but i mean in real life all you do in crypts is mourn the graphics were great very realistic its amazing how much the graphics in this series keeps getting better and better this was probably the most unique setting in the series i personally love trains boats and planes so this made me really happy puzzles activitiesthe puzzles were fairly easy i liked how a lot of the puzzles were combined into one to find where jake 's mine is what was disappointing was the repetition of the puzzles there were about four or five pipe sets you had to connect which got a little annoying you also had to retrieve a lot of items like gemstones tools duct tape a pen and other stuff i do n't understand how they made finding the gemstones easier than playing an almost impossible game with tino to get a simple pen some of the puzzles were unique like camille 's doll sorting puzzle and her favorite dance step playing camptown races on the piano and using metal slugs in a mathematical way to open doors on a scale but some of these activities needed no skill at all like combinations a word search and a two memory games this game had variety but also repeated some puzzles as well which brought down its score endingonce you find out where jake 's mine your sent off there to get a head start for a treasure you 'd think that after all the puzzles you went through you would think finding the treasure in the mine would be somewhat harder than everything else you open the entrance memorize a couple things follow some lizards and then use the info you memorized not that difficult if you are smart then you find the treasure and your so called culprit you would n't know this person is the culprit when he she finds you in the mine and talks to you but then he she loses trust in you and you get caved in then you get out \( i thought this was fun to do felt like a roller coaster \) to stop the culprit i liked the ending and what the treasure was but getting through and out of the mine was relatively easy although the culprit was kind of obvious i liked what the culprit 's plan or goal was overall it was good ending yet a little easier than i thought it should have been overallthis was one of the better nancy drew games out there definitely one to add to your shelf the flaws in this game do n't affect the game that much as they could have if the setting was different the plot was pretty good and most of the puzzles fit into it i enjoyed this game a lot after i played it more than two times i think any game needs to be played more than two times to get the full experience some parts of the game are really exciting compared to other parts the repetition of some of the puzzles is n't too bad this game is outstanding but there is never going to be the best nancy drew game it really depends on your opinion add all these up and divide by 6 4 's \( gameplay interface \) 4 's \( plot \) 4 's \( characters \) 5 's \( setting graphics \) 3 's \( puzzles \) 4 's \( ending \) 24 stars divide by 6 \( categories \) 4 starsthanks for reading	22
0	i bought this product for my children because it looked neat ! what they do n't tell you is that the paint must be diluted before you can use it \( why not include the pre diluted paint \? but i digress \) even after thinning the paint the product hardly spins if we could get it to work it seemed like a neat concept but it just does n't work i have no idea if it is because it needs very thin paint or the motor is weak or what we returned ours for a refund	22
0	i really enjoyed my nano chi iron while it lasted \( rip 7 06 11 06 \) it handles well it 's a great straightener and it 's a pretty color however i dropped it approximately two feet onto a carpeted floor and it stopped working i purchased the chi about four months ago and think that a 120 iron should be a bit more resiliant i 'll still purchase chi products but would n't recommend investing in the nano technology just yet there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out and it 's not worth having to pay an extra 35 to have it repaired	22
0	i bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting although well built it is poorly designed the place where the hit a way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs the cables on the hit a way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit you might get one or two hits in before it is unusable a giant waste of money the only reason i give it 2 stars is the construction is solid	22
1	not much to add to the other positive reviews posted other than i am another user that loves my d50 have had it for a year now and shot over 10 000 photos with excellent results \( mostly landscape and wildlife \) excellent image quality and the hand grip fits perfectly to both my hand and my husbands the only con i can think of at this time is that there is no backlight on the top panel this makes it difficult to adjust settings in low no light situations also for people that are used to the little compact point shoot cameras this might seem a little overwhelming at first and bulky to carry around \( which is why i have a little pocket camera for my purse \) i also got the 18 200 lens and love it perfect walk around lens	22
0	i'm glad someone knows enough about english history to recognize the pure fiction of this film but in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy i also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of mary tudor over zealous and fanatic \( as was a common religious stance in those times promoted by both sides of the protestant catholic conflict \) she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes and throughout the film there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth no objectivity whatsoever i was sorely disappointed ! if you want to get to know elizabeth and the period in which she lived i would recommend the superb bbc series elizabeth r with glenda jackson and if you want even further background look to the bbc again in the six wives of henry viii with keith mitchell tidbits can be gained as well from the movie mary queen of scots \( although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it for example mary stuart and elizabeth never met although it was mary 's great desire \) and even another title anne of the thousand days those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times this film just does n't cut it	22
0	native tongueby carl hiaasenthis book is fast paced has a lot of energy and a zany weirdness no doubt it is a page turner and it is better than the other book of hiaasen 's i have read double whammy but all that does not a good read make a strength of hiaasen 's books are his characters well defined and numerous most are straightforward stereotypes from the out of luck journalist turned publicist the vapid sex phone girlfriend a steroid doped strongman the crude and sleazy millionaire bad guy a muscular but clear minded black good guy cop to the dumb but intrinsically good guy burglars and loads of redneck florida crackers hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops and by casting two characters that are quite original an environmentally militant 70 aged woman and an environmentally crazed former governor gone wildman and we meet psychotic whales and sex starved dolphins etc etc so what 's wrong mainly it 's that the book stays at a level of tv sitcom gone book it achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject one might think that the exception is the environment but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here so perhaps native tongue is just pure entertainment \? if you like brainless action gratuitous violence gross humor and zany fun native tongue might satisfy i have one additional problem with hiassen and it 's similar to the problem i so often have with michael crichton these books stink of hypocrisy crichton makes a \( seriously good \) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science hiassen 's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society but hiaasen 's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness while i enjoyed a few sections of native tongue i had no doubts at the end that i had wasted many hours that should have been better spent	22

0	i was very happy to discover that i could purchase an asian cabbage patch girl doll it was for a little korean girl the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for \( the hair \) well i was excited to find one and i wanted to make sure that i would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to texas in time for christmas i ordered in on the 27th and received it on dec 1st \( i paid for faster shipping \) when i opened the box it was an asian doll but not the one with the ponytails this doll had short hair i called amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it would n't happen again i have used amazon before with no problems but i am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch i should have read the other reviews i will never let that happen again beware do not order things of this nature from this website you will be disappointed	22
0	i was looking forward to purchasing this item until i got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost the cheapest shipping would run me 14 99 for an item costing 21 89 sorry weatherbuffs you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price	22
0	i got this product to help me sleep and it did not work for me i used to take some pain killer sleep aid made by members mark and that worked great but i no longer need the pain killer i bought this and have tried it 3 times now and i ca n't quite explain it but it did not make me tired it made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times i used it not only did it not make me drowsy i could n't sleep and i woke up several times during the night i think i would have done better without it but everyone reacts to drugs differently so try at your own risk	22
1	the foot massager is great it 's open design allows it to be used on the legs as well as the feet unlike others that are boot like the massager adjusts to your size legs and feet automatically for a snug fit the massager is adjustable to almost any configuartion with tilt raise lower and etc the only problem with this device is that it can become top heavy as a result of the adjustability of it so keeping it upright can be a bit challenging but for the price and quality this is a great relief on the feet and legs as well as wallet	22

1	i cannot speak about the food item because it is in my pantry and i have not tried it yet i will speak however on the customer service of importfood com thai supermarket first off this is the first time i have ever been asked to submit a review for something i purchased via amazon this tells me that importfood com is interested in feedback from their customers in order to continue their process improvement i applaud that and have happily complied secondly out of all the times i have ordered from amazon this was the fastest delivery i have ever had i was so surprised to see the box i did n't know what it was at first because i was n't expecting the product for several weeks not a couple of days when i opened the box i could n't believe that it was the product i had just ordered so i am a very happy customer to have found the exact item i was looking for at a very reasonable price with even better rate on shipping \( i was worried about the inc in gas would drive up shipping to make it not worth it \) and then to receive it so quickly thanks	22
1	the device shows a lot of info like it should nice design and accurate as well it 's just as good if not better than the television weather forecast and current conditions the only thing i would improve upon is the readability of the face of the instrument it has to be read from directly in front or it is not clear enough	22
0	they 're pretty but flimsy very light construction the lens is not really mirrored so if you attempting to hide your eyes forget it it would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap chinese knock off gave them two stars simply because they are good looking but cheap and they feel that way on your face	22
0	ok i really thought this ball would be great considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the nba not so ! this ball feels very similar to the cheap 20 balls you can get at your local department stores ! feels similar to the wilson ncaa solution game ball but slightly less tacky but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber i personally do not like that this ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box without a break in period well i hope it gets to feeling better over time but since it supposedly has not break in period i am very skeptical i honestly do not feel the crosstraxxion design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball if you like the feel of leather this is not for you i am not impressed ! search for reviews for this ball before purchasing ! the only thing you can do with this ball that you ca n't do with others is say well at least this is the official game ball the pros use !	22

0	as a fan of pete seeger 's music i bought this cd in the hope that the family connection would ensure similar quality of the music disappointingly i 've found this album really grates on me after a couple of songs peggy 's vocal style in particular becomes mighty annoying to listen to over the length of the album as her delivery can best be described as a neo hillbilly twang i may end up combining the best half dozen songs from this album with some other folk albums to generate a listenable quot best of quot set but i 'd find it unthinkable to listen to this entire set in one sitting only devoted fans of the genre or the duo should invest in this set more casual fans of folk should direct their dollars to any of pete 's fine albums such as the carnegie hall classic	22
0	i saw the show on stage i saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this unfortunately this is ann reinking 's version of bob fosse reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential fosse dancer of the 70 's and 80 's created this tribute the difference is ann reinking has taken the fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own as a tribute to fosse this is inaccurate therefore for fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works also there is a too big reliance on his concept musical dancin' the one good thing in this is the addition of another fosse creation ben vereen he shows why he can still pack a house my suggestion is to rent fosse films like sweet charity and all that jazz you 'll get to see the real fosse	22

0	cook 's illustrated is the first cooking magazine that i 'd found myself truly motivated to read cover to cover even though they do insert advertisements for their own products which i suppose to them makes this an ad free magazine but i'm not surprised they 've bent the rules with that claim the one time i found it necessary to contact cook 's illustrated about a customer service issue i was simply floored by the treatment that i received i 'll simply leave it at that i personally do n't intend on re subscribing \( fine cooking here i come ! \) you however may find that this is the cooking magazine for you and as far as what they do goes cook 's illustrated is good at what they do i 'll give them that if you have not found this review to be helpful i'm sorry if i have n't made the value in my warning apparent just know that there are those of us out there who have had bad experiences and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same	22
0	be cautioned when ordering this product what happened was i ordered this product a month ago and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite size version i called amazon explained my problem they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement well the replacement came last week and it was still the flatbread i'm not going to bother to call amazon again because i know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again the flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy i think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor you can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top it tastes very different than wheat and i like the taste of spelt quite a bit so please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order you may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call amazon to straighten things out	22

0	the manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the panasonic fz1 \( and by extension the fz3 which has an identical body \) i bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the fz1 with just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out if you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera ca n't fit in the bag at all there 's also no padding to speak of with this case by comparison my lowe case for my canon eos elan provides a secure padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again targus makes decent laptop cases but they have a great deal to learn about camera cases apparently apparently it does fit some cameras just not the panasonic fzs considering the product is made in china one should be able to expect a bit more at this price	22

1	car and driver is the multi purpose auto magazine it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world and magazines like motor trend which focus on the more practical the magazine is always a fun intereseting read and keeps you up to date on teh auto world i must however say that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track \( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography \)	22

0	ok ive been using proactiv 4 about a year now and i have to say that it did work for me well like 90 with one or two breakouts a month so i was pretty pleased about that people often asked me what i did cuz my change was drastic so that was nice one night i styed up late and that murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day couple of days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead i knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again i have now gone back to proactiv and seen improvement so hopefully within the next couple of weeks it will clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under a rock hahaha my main advice is to really do ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before	22

1	xxl is much better than the source and vibe it will always be my favorite magazine keep it up xx	22
1	i have been canvasing the internet for some type of guard to cover the hearth in our family room i have read countless reviews of the double faced tape foam pads that come off right away with little effort this product attached exactly as described i had the unit installed as well as the pads measured cut and installed in 10 minutes the taupe color is very discrete on our cream red black brick fireplace i ca n't see how my three little ones would ever get this off even if they tried great product and gives me the feeling of comfort that if someone falls and hits there head that the chance of sticthes has been greatly reduced an absolute must for your hearth	22
0	i have to agree with the bad reviews i used this smoker 6 times and the element burned out of course a replacement was 40 00 i purchased it new on sale for 65 00 it is now a charcoal smoker unless you have money to burn ! i would not recomend this item	22
0	i absolutely agree with the two other reviewers i had very high hopes too as i use mccann 's brown bread mix all the time i do n't think i could live without it so i was very disappointed with the fruit scones mix there is a very weird taste to me it seems like 'soapy' or something but definitely not a pleasure to eat i 've got tons of bags left of this mix which i will have to throw away i would definitely not recommend this product sorry	22
1	i 've tried many a serum potion lotion cream every over the counter fit it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had ! i know iknow there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting but i 've yet to see it	22

1	i muchly recommend suggest buying purchasing these batteries power sources in the pre tried used section you can save pay less for them these that way but be warned aware used pre tried batteries is may be no good since they is not may be rechargedable	22
1	pretty good solid peanut butter taste and no digestive problem i enjoyed them for hiking and biking i do n't recommend them near water because when wet they taste not so good good snack for kids when hungry and its better for them then sugarly things	22
0	i was hoping the book would be good most reviews are however the topics are not really covered at all more introduced it was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing they openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english just as well long rambling thaughts that do n't form conclusions not what i wanted or needed it actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go	22
1	i would agree with the translator that imitation of christ ranks very close to the bible i read it over and over it is shocking clear and concise it forces you to examine your conscience and admit that you are a sinner and encourages you not to be afraid to carry your cross and aim yes to be a saint thomas a kempis 's words cut to the heart and ring true over and over in the normal state of human depravity deception duplicity relativism and excuse making no one could write such a book without a transcendant almighty omniscient omnipresent and infinitely merciful lord each chapter feeds the hungry and thirsty soul and feeds the fire to seek our lord more and more i wait patiently for your return lord jesus for your judgement and the new heavan and earth	22
1	this battery arrived fast fits and works well i highly recommend this seller	22
0	i 've had this straightener for about 3 months i loved it at first but now it 's a love hate relationship the gold plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use the effect my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff ! to make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates i gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair something that is hard to do ! this is the second store brand straightener i 've purchased with poor results save your and buy a professional model from a hairdresser it 's cheaper in the long run	22
1	i 've been using these earbuds for several months now and they 're far better than the ones that come with the ipod they 're more comfortable and there 's so much more bass although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass my pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once and they still sound just as good as the day i got them ! \( i did have to glue one of the earpieces back together though \) i thought i 'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet but these things are industrial strength	22
1	i ordered one but would like to know if on the last review if that is salt water or fresh and what kind of luck and on the other update on further finds as for the other review just find google and type in bounty hunter and the name of the detector and you 'll find all of that then knock it down to the best buy and or support which ever is important to you i bought a detector when i was 13 by picking strawberries all summer i am 30 years past that and i had a blast until i sat on it lt i want that fun back ! i know im kinda turning this into a blog but its important for things left unsaid and more helpful for those checking it out for the first time	22
1	my son received this one as well as the other colorfelt toy he was not impressed with it in regards to playing with it on his own it does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together	22
1	this was the webkinz my daughter wanted and she 's been very happy with it there was a delivery problem but the seller from whom i bought it was a pleasure to deal wit	22
0	this item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks i bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and i only wear it 4 6 hours a night this product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so i like the design and it does n't cut up my mouth but i ca n't be replacing it every other month	22
1	i 've been using this for several years without ever having a problem i like this new version even better than the last version by having everything in one control panel makes it easier than before it uses less system resources than norton plus i know people that have gotten viruses using norton mcafee kaspersky always rates in the top three the only drawback is there is no anti spyware but i do n't feel that is an issue let them worry about viruses such i 'll continue using webroot 's spysweeper to control spyware together they make a great combo to keep my computer clean	22
0	i cannot review this item because a month later i still have not received the first issue of my subscription sorryfrank caldero	22
1	very compact light and easy to hold full marks for design buttons etc can take a bit of getting used to but ok once mastered main downside for me it only takes dvd r rw and not dvd r rw bit of a problem when you pick up the wrong ones ! also can be a problem taking it abroad i had issues charging it as it would take a standard us to uk converter plug as the pins are slightly wider than normal us plugs	22
0	i would like to buy one of these products from wine country gift baskets but i cannot find a description of what is actually in each one	22
0	i give it 3 stars for porn and 2 stars for a movie therefore collectively you have your single star by all means i suggest you get yourself some hardcore porn beat off and then watch a real movie caligula blows literally and royally it is a little under 3 hours which seemed like 3 days and there is only about 20 minutes of decent film the small amount of story that is somewhat portrayed is simply stepped on by asinine porn the most triumphant scene in the movie is where the roman soldiers attack the phallus humbling papyrus stalks while flailing their genitals to and fro this movie is ridiculous in order to enjoy this one must be completely perverted and dimwitted	22
1	this recommended software is easy to load except for online requirements to update the files due to changes in the documents from the time of publication software release the files for download was large and took a long time on a dialup internet connection the software was easy to use without documentation though documentation would have been much desired the time to fill in the data was not too long it took about 4 6 hours given that i had been filing all the tax info in a folder with all the references required the help in the software was great and insightful i preferred using a cpa in the past but since my taxes has gotten significantly easier this has been a definite cost savings e filing was easy but make sure not to lose the cd sleeve after downloading the software otherwise it costs extra to e file overall it appears to be a great software package with great info and help i plan to use it next year lord willing !	22
1	i used mine for two weeks snorkeling in hawaii it is n't perfect it does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface but it is n't enough to cause any problems it is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow you probably wo n't find anything better	22
0	really dry and just not as good as could be a disappointment after using this companys other products	22
0	one of my boys bought this item for me and well its ok for the price its kinda sticky on the skin unless you rub it in really well and the scent is extremly light which i dont like now if they were to make it stronger this would be a 5 star product	22
0	it is a very lovely two piece set and amazon shipped it to me twice and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards i gave up but from what i could tell from the remains this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear i'm not sure considering the shipping problems whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher	22
0	this seemed like a wonderful grill but the regulator \( which keeps gas from leaking \) failed after about a month unlike other grills the charbroil regulator has to be purchased as part of the full burner assembly \( over 100 while other grill manufacturers sell just the regulator and tube for about 20 \) the regulator 's not covered by their warranty either customer support has been terrible with communication only coming through charbroil 's faq 's on the web fortunately there are enough other charbroil owners with similar problems who have written on the web about this problem i will never buy a charbroil product again this has all been so terribly disappointing because i 've wanted to support a good u s company but charbroil 's engineering and customer support is reminding me of the big three automakers in the 1980s	22
0	i do n't know who jj cole made this hat for my daughter had the tiniest head and it still did n't fit waste of money	22

1	i bought this cd player for my daughter 's 5th birthday not expecting it to last a month to my surprise it 's worked wonderfully she figured out how to operate it pretty easily and she listens to it every night before bed we 've had it for 6 months now with no problems my favorite feature is the compartment for the cd 's it keeps them from being left lying around and getting scratched	22
0	to start i am a very big fan of doris day for yeays i had just bought the 6 dvd box set of her movies loved that so i decided to buy this tv series it is so awful words ca n't describe it it 's not because it 's dated because i love lucy is alot older sheer perfection it 's initially nice to see doris in another genre but this first series just does n't work for me for many reasons the subject matters chosen are thoughtful \( that 's the reason i gave it two stars the presence of doris \) i 'll tell you the show just bored me i found myself fast forworded through the last 10 episodes the dvd extra interviews with two members of the cast are interesting there 's no new interviews with doris \( that 's an old interview they put on there \) i think the only thing new is that 8x10 shot with her dog	22
1	this unit is well built will last and is easy to use assembly is a breeze we have had it almost two years and it performs superbly in all types of cooking it heats up quickly \( and gets hot ! \) yet the flames can be turned way down and never blow out we use it several times a week and a propane canister lasts about three to four weeks of course if you turn all its mighty burners on and leave 'em that way it 'll eat a lot of propane but that kind of usage would quickly cremate anything you might be cooking i suspect that people who complain about propane consumption with this barbecue are cooking with the hood up contrary to weber 's instructions \( and common sense \) and let 's face it any barbecue with six mighty burners like these will use its share of propane pluses thick solid stainless steel bars sear beautifully and will last forever you want solid bars ! the thermal inertia is key to good grilling and stainless means no rusty taste no chipping and easy to clean fine flame control six burners let you configure the heat the way you want the rotisserie and smoker box have thier own burners ! the side burner works well too for cooking veggies and stuff in a pot powerful yet capable of gentle cooking wo n't rust built like a tank no cheap chinese componentry as often found in even formerly premium brands and all house brands most of which are made entirely in china even the big stainless steel extravaganzas that sell for thousands do n't be fooled by fancy knobs and gewgaws the quality is just not there deep inside far too many barbecues today i 've personally witnessed two big top of the line house brand barbecues returned to a leading warehouse retailer by irate purchasers who could n't believe they 'd crap out after a year that never happens with weber convenient fold down work surfaces easy to clean huge cooking area anti flare burner configuration works well lights instantly easy to wheel around the yard something i wanted to be able to do and which a built in would n't allow fantastic weber service mine was manhandled by the shipping company weber handled my complaint with the shipping company for me \( i did n't have to do anything at all \) and sent me a new panel without any hassle at all their 24 hour support hotline is the best i 've used anywhere for any product and emails are handled same day negatives expensive \( but worth it \) i 'd buy it again in a heartbeat it was my first weber after years of thinking they were only popular because they 're stylish now i get it	22
1	so far this product is working fine has plenty of power heats food in a flash very good quality for the price i paid for i	22
1	this is amazing i tell ya seriously i 've doubted it since my first child and then my twins \( never got it \) with them just assumed it was some hype well with my last baby and finally a girl i caved its hard to hold a baby all day long when you hve 3 other children and a home to keep in order \( or try \) anyway her screams were out of no where she was n't happy being put anywhere to sleep other than on you and sometimes that was n't good enough she cried and cried and waled it really drove us all bonkers she is n't a pacifyer baby either so we were at loss she was obviously really gassy she got hiccups alot she 's breastfed and we could n't figure out what it was that maybe i was eating \? sure enough today we tried it and she 's peacefully sleeping without stirring i recomend it 110 my husband got it at his work with a 20 discount i'm so relieved	22
1	this movie is almost 40 years old can you believe it \? to those of you who have n't seen this classic my only question to you is why \? why in the world have you been depriving yourself of something so incredible so wonderful so fun so beautiful it is just one of those movies that makes you almost kind of sad that we do n't have filmakers and storytellers like we used to we have become a group of people who are more interested in constant action that we have forgotten how to tell a story we have become a group of people who desire to be constantly stimulated rather than allowing ourselves to get interested and involved if this movie was created in today 's market and it pains me to say this it would be a box office flop but fortunately it was made when it was made fortunately it had three of the most talented actors of our time in it the always incredible paul newman the likeable robert redford and the stunningly gorgeous katherine ross the combination of these three characters is absolutely magical if they made this movie today it would probably have in it brad pitt ben affleck and jennifer lopez yuk ! i better shutup before somebody gets a bright idea of remaking this classic movie i cannot even imagine somebody having the gall to even try and redo this jewel of a movie everything in this movie is top notch every scene is just gorgeous and full i was just a kid when i first saw it and i did n't fully understand all the layers that this movie contains now in my early 40s i truly appreciate roy hill 's vision everything seems so natural there is nothing forced in this movie there is nothing contrived there is nothing but pure movie magic if you 've been waiting for an invitation to finally see this movie consider this your invitation but i warn you do not buy it if your attention span is less than four seconds so if you 've read this entire review without changing the television channel or talking on the cell phone or text messaging one of your homies then you passed the test and you are free to view this incredible piece of cinema	22
0	i am a huge fan of btnh but even i will admitt this is not a good album the worst being home which uses samples from phil collins the whole thing feels kind of empty with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works there are a few songs worth listening to most notably is clevland is the city which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any harmony to it other songs worth mentioning are what about us not my baby and pump pump the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage it is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released	22
0	hi it was impossible to use this product because the keythey gave me did n't work imight make a fisbee out of the dvd ! jerr	22
1	with most of the carrying case made of either fake leather or some kind of neoprene material this one is really different the rigid structure also seem to do a great job to protect the camera there is also a belt loop and d ring feature which is great	22
1	i was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies hearing is believing it gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that i simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub i had purchased for movies it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy it really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market i am not certain it can go as low as 27hz since i have not measured but i am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls i just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system i could i was able to do so with the addition of this sub i am glad i found and tried it before paying much more for another sub i was considering yet i hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250 watt sub its peak dynamic power is 250 watts but the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier therefore it is a 150 watt sub	22
0	it amazes me that this model is being sold here since the product was recalled by the manufacturer a newer safer model is offered for just 10 more by vornado do your homework before you buy	22
1	i used to read the online content for this magazine \( i still check out the blog \) but i have to say that there is even more content in the magazine than there is online and it 's really worth subscribing the articles are well written and usually change my mind on issues i may not have realized i had a mind to change on i would recommend this magazine to anyone	22

0	i have owned my diaper dekor plus for 25 months in 2005 i found glowing reports in the wall street journal and most other places it definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile but the trapdoors have broken twice i contacted regal lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement that free replacement broke less than 6 months later you ca n't expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken ! this week i contacted regal lager again and they said a replacement is 10 i loved this pail until the trapdoors broke unfortunately it looks like it is a common design flaw as i browse the reviews from the last year or so i am an engineer and i do n't know what to say except i am really annoyed that the product is not more durable regal lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system instead of relying on 10 replacement parts especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle ! now i have to decide whether to spend 10 on another replacement try to fix it myself get a different pail or maybe none of the above at what point is enough enough \?	22
0	this is not a jockstrap it is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity i tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable let alone not exactly hygenic ! no surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by rips	22

0	my son is a thomas fanatic this lunchbox did n't last one week without one of the legs snapping off so it would n't stand up then a few weeks later he dropped it and the handle shattered total waste of money it 's a shame it has a nice storage box in front but the quality is below even what i 'd expect from a chinese sweatshop	22
1	while photek was \( and still is \) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound his approach changes significantly on quot solaris quot starting off with the first three tracks his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work \( especially on quot modus operandi quot \) but sound more full more resonant the tracks where he wanders into the realm of house were quite repeditive and despite robert owen 's wonderful efforts \( first time i 've heard him \) they were lacking the best track on the album and one of the best photek works is definitely quot infinity quot the rumbling bass really cuts right to the core and reminds me a little of source direct the trip hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music but the more ethereal quot halogen quot left an impression a wash of sound that previously parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll it comes off much better for the lack of any true form not a great album but solid and indicative of where photek would like to go in terms of his future works	22
0	do n't waste your money this album is cheesy sounds like a million other pop rock songs and is nothing compared to their earlier work with donnie van zant and max carl on vocals all i have to say is they need the old lead singer back ! the guitar work is ok but the classic 38 special sound has definitely been lost	22
1	i used to have some remington shaver that a friend bought me for the last 5 yrs it was n't bad but sometimes it irritated the skin my first shaver was my dad 's old school norelco shaver so i thought i 'd give them a try again the first one i got from amazon was 40 \( i forgot the model \) and ended up sending it back to norelco for their 60 day guarantee it was just alright this one i feel about the same way i mean it shaves decently but as an asian male with not much facial hair i still see that i have to shave every couple days which i prefer not to the cleaning system is cool and the fact that this shaver is so easy to clean \( it says you can open it up and run it under water which i 've been doing to clean it \) make it worthwhile to me though the battery life is also good if there was a half star system i 'd give this shaver a 4 5 5	22
1	i bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers with the touch of one button i can keep track of how long it has been since i fed my baby i do n't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone the first unit i was sent was defective and i received terrific customer service when i contacted the company i am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because i 'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well maybe a future model	22

0	i 've had this coffeemaker for two weeks i bought it because i had an old mr coffee that worked fine but was white and stained i liked that this was black and looked sleek the very second time i used it the off button stuck so you can no longer turn off the machine but have to wait for it to turn itself off also every pot has grounds in it i'm using the filters that came with it and have never even filled it to capacity and i ca n't figure out why there are always grounds in my coffee piece of junk do n't buy it	22

1	when i buy flash memory i consider price speed manufacturer and vendor i got this particular memory stick for a sonyericsson w810i phone i paid extra to get it from amazon \( no they do n't always have the best price \) this way i am confident that i can return it if i got the wrong one or have a problem with it the card works fine in my phone and since i have a usb cable that hooks up to the phone i do n't have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader i have not yet experienced any problems with sandisk memory products i am told that the sandisk sticks are faster than sony 's but i have no way to confirm this nor do i know if my phone \( mp3 player camera \) is able to take advantage of faster speeds the longest process is transferring music to the phone and i was n't in a hurry anyway this stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format so i can use the 128mb stick that i replaced in my sony camcorder \( which had a 4mb stick in it no it 's not a typo it 's actually a 4 megabyte memory stick \)	22
1	the samsung i bought shows a great quality pictue i love it	22
0	i ordered this the night of the oscars i will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy there was n't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging it looks like a bad vhs transfer i should have returned it but it would 've been more trouble than it was worth i thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be but unfortunately in my case i have to add buyer beware	22

1	wow ! is all i can say to express my reaction after getting prints taken with my 17 40 i 've been using nikon manual focus nikkors since 1988 and was always satisfied with the color and sharpness however after using the canon l series i 've sold a lot of my nikkors the color clarity sharpness and detail of the l lenses are amazing the prints have this 3 d effect \( without having to use those silly red blue glasses ! \) 8 \) within 3 weeks of receiving my 17 40 i ordered the 70 200 those two lenses will replace my whole nikkor collection build is really good the l zooms are a little bulkier but very managable the nikkors are smaller but very heavy but lense technology and coatings have improved so much in 20 years i can see the difference i tested the lens by pointing it toward the sun the 17 40 surprising handles flare very well with the sun just outside the field of view there was very little flare and loss of contrast i also make 12x18 prints and this lens handles them easily the body is going to be the limiting factor \( refering to digital bodies \) warning once you use l glass you are going to be spoiled you may not settle for consumer lenses anymore although some non l lenses are quick good from what i read	22

0	i 've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full time in the summer and very little the rest of the year while the shoes are comfortable i was disappointed at how fast they 're falling apart the padding around the ankle has torn there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes and i was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement the solid rubber outsole delivers long wearing durability that 's been my major complaint with these shoes shortly after i got them the soles cracked at the heel and now layers of the soles are peeling off i recommend buying another model	22
0	i have about two to three years of knit n style \( 2001 2003 \) magazines and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a cardigan pattern to knit for myself i have n't found a single one all of the patterns have serious faults drop shoulders \( totally unacceptable \) little or no armhole neck and or shoulder shaping most sleeves have little or no cap and worst of all they are all made in five or more pieces have n't any of these quot designers quot heard of elizabeth zimmerman \? i was going to give the lot to the library but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place if you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people why do n't you teach them the proper way to knit \? young people are smarter than you think	22

1	we have the baby bjorn step stool potty chair little potty and now the toilet trainer hind sight is 20 20 the toilet trainer and step stool is all you need our initial thought was to have the potty chair for home and the little potty for trips the reality is our daughter would sit on her potty then want to sit on the toilet like mommy and daddy we balanced her on the toilet before we decided to get the toilet trainer no more balancing acts on the toilet she can use her step stool to get on the toilet when she wants the toilet trainer travels well fits all types of toilets easy to install remove and clean ! the potty chair and little potty are fantastic quality but you might as well go with the toilet trainer from the start	22
1	when i was 21 and in my first year of graduate school paul fussell 's quot poetic meter and poetic form quot was one of the first text books assigned to me when i bought the book and saw how slim it was i snickered quot grad school 's gonna be a walk in the park ! quot yeah right ! this densely packed tome is not for the uninitiated and definitely not absorbed in just one reading on and off over the last 20 years i have come back to this book to refresh my memory and usually to astonish myself the book 's real strength besides professor fussell 's obvious command of his subject and his ability to convey that command is in the sprinkling of dozens of anecdotes by and about poets about other poets and poetry even at this late date in my life i ca n't pretend to understand the entire book but what i do understand i admire and respect quot poetic meter and poetic form quot is not recommended to anyone studying poetry it is urgently required	22

0	i am on my second zadro led lighted fogless mirror yes customer service was decent and they sent me a new one however the initial problem was repeated plus some it fogs up despite following directions using their spray and using words i shoul n't repeat here additionally the clock runs slow and one of the two lights is out after only a few months one good thing is that suction cups still hold it up as long as i press them in every week this product has problems which make a mockery of its zfogless claim save yourself the trouble do n't buy it	22

1	i had forgotten how awesome this movie is even for a grown up like me it could do without all the songs \( it was made before disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing \) but it 's brisk double layered humor more than makes up for it kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly adults will pick up on the nearly sarcastic nearly risque dialog so rare in disney animated movies plus big foot dancing to 'stayin' alive' is just freaking hilarious basically it 's just a disney movie but it 's a great \( and severely under appreciated \) disney movie	22

1	pros compact and complete this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it 's reversible backdrop \( gray blue \) i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well construction quality is good \( i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs \) sturdy enough for its intended purpose i like the output of the lights seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight cons only one complaint the output of the lights could be stronger requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture	22
0	i heard from a number of people that amon amarth were an excellent death metal band so with that in mind i though i 'd try osftgh what i hear and it certainly seems i'm missing out on something is sloppy musicianship and poor songwriting just because you have mead dripping from your beard and you scream out lyrics that contain no mercy vengeance and it 's your time to die does not mean you can create authentic viking metal these idiots could definitely take lessons from enslaved manegarm falkenbach to name a few do n't fall for the hype !	22

1	i think that the beginning of the book was the worst part he started by telling us that he was leaving and was n't going to tell anyone he did n't even say goodbye to a lady friend so he tells us that he 's leaving and then he goes back into the past back when he was a little kid he tells about different experiances how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years he tells about all the troubles that his family went through the end was the best part i usually hate the endings but this one was good this bool is meant for older people who like english books or is it ireland i think it was set in irelan	22
1	my first viewing of the campy film secretary could not have been more ironic because i had been working as a secretary ahem assistant for a solo practitioner for only two months i recall leaving the theater feeling empowered despite knowing that the next day i would have to fetch whatever my boss wanted when he wanted it there are bosses not just the lawyers who long for the old fashioned secretary bravo to the filmmaker for rendering secretary 's unflinching revelations about emotional pain as unsettling as its erotic depictions of the catharsis of that pain i found and still find the film to be a surreal and vicarious pleasure not that what ensues between the boss and assistant in secretary is unrealistic perhaps you know of a solo proprietor whose temp secretaries kept quitting but who now has a full time assistant why is that assistant a perfect match \? intellectually i admire the filmmaker 's courage in commenting poetically upon the ways in which american society conditions women to be passive and to devalue themselves leave it to an art indie film to expose how some \( or many \? \) american women find themselves either stuck in a time warp of adolescent vanity or suffering through existential paralysis because american women are taught to identify and value themselves through their relationships with men it is a total thrill in secretary to watch the script flip the stereotype of the skirt chasing boss on its head in terms of casting i cannot imagine anyone but maggie gyllenhaal in the title role her secretary is like the repressed alter ego of elizabeth taylor 's maggie the cat on that hot tin roof full of angst but no less smoldering maggie g appears to purr rather than speak james spader who once upon a time seemed typecast as a snooty yuppie gets the chance in secretary to fully realize his erotic potential while his character can be viewed as tongue in cheek he delivers a genuinely quirky and sensitive performance when you get down to it the various vicarious experiences in secretary will please some and repulse others for me i received instant motivation to strive for accuracy in transcribing my boss 's future dictation	22

0	my wife bought this one from best buy without me reviewing it 1st amazingly i would have bought it after reading the reviews here i'm starting to wonder who writes these things lg employees \? the microwave is fine no complaints the toaster however is an unmitigated disaster i am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances this appliance is a poster child for this thought the toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently \( sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10 ! \) more importantly the toaster broke after 31 days \( coincidently the best buy return policy ends at the same time best buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named ricky managing the store what can you expect \? \) lg picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty the problem is they ca n't think outside of the box they had me get it repaired but i have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up ok no problem one day later \? it breaks again it is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not that 's how bad it was lg will not budge have it repaired again \( great option costs lg money me more travel time and it wo n't do the job \) or do a rebate the rebate requires me to buy another lg or goldstar product huh \? so you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace \( they admitted they do n't have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new \) and then do n't stand behind your product you backend me into another lg or goldstar product that i would not have otherwise bought how does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here \? our we so bad as a manufacturer that we ca n't top this \? their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this you can cal korea but they wo n't change their policy they said i will never willingly buy another lg or goldstar product and i highly recommend you do the same shame on you lg you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me	22

0	got my bowflex weeks ago and having trouble lots of trouble putting it together it 's not the product 's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha seems the parts could 've been marked better identification is pretty much visual instead you have a picture map to compare what part is needed i was doing fine until i inserted the wrong bolt stripped the bolt trying to get it out got the wd40 on it finally had to use a crescent wrench so my confidence is blown and then i continued on to assemble the seat backwards the assemblage directions could be better believe me i used the 800 once but i finally found that no matter what was suggested the picture was misleading and there 's no way that could 've been explained onward through the fog !	22

1	i have had this awesome little device for about 5 years now in that time there have been two attempts by car thieves to take my car \( a honda civic \) the first attempt it looks as though they saw it and moved on \( door was open things shuffled about \) this was while it was parked at my school in the midst of a string of honda civic thefts \( there had been no less than 10 thefts of modified civics in the past two months which is what inspired me to buy this \) given the context of the situation and since nothing else was taken or disturbed the only logical conclusion is that they were after the car itself the second attempt was by a much more aggressive would be thief this one worked at the clutch lock for a good long time when i got to my car the next morning the clutch pedal covering was broken off and the pedal bar itself was bent slightly off to the right however the lock remained solidly in place they even broke into my trunk to retrieve the tools to try and pry it off they had no such luck the pedal cover was replaced for 10 and all was well i would trust any car to this in any situation certainly you should use an alarm as well and be conscious about where you leave your car but this is a fantastic deterrent this product is the best 60 bucks i have ever spent on my car get it	22
1	i purchased this dvd because it said it was an easier pilates video to do basically anyone even beginners could do it i have to disagree i started this video and tried to do all of the 5 ten minute sections it was n't completely hard but definitely challenging i am not the most fit person but also not the most unfit i had a harder time because i am just not as limber as you should be to use this pilates video i am not saying i would n't suggest it i am just saying it 's not definitely for beginners however the instructions are clear and since it 's broken up into the five ten minute sections it gets even lazy people like me to get off the couch and do it	22
0	oh my all the terrible reviews for this book are true ! ! ms steel is excessively repetitive i mean excessive ms steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over you get the picture i too found myself saying okay we get it already i also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had i do n't know the men ms steel knows and hangs out with but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them oh please no man on earth talks that way especially to other men this book is completely aweful the plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention i have read many of ms steel 's books and i believe this one is her worst i have now started reading sandra brown and she is sooo much better i recommend the alibi so far that has been my favorite by her she has mystery suspense romance her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than ms steels to sum it up i was completely disappointed with the book toxic bachelors i highly recommend sandra brown she is a much better author	22
0	my son is 5yrs old and this was one of the 1st things on his christmas list he loves power rangers of all kinds but when we finally opened this and i tried to put it together i thought i was doing it wrong b c nothing fit or stayed together ! ! my son still played with the dragon part that was already put together but the storage bin is useless and the rope that the power ranger can slide down is barely high enough that he stays off of the ground and he pretty much falls down rather than sliding down the so called instructions were horrible and another reviewer was correct in indicating how small the pictures were i would have never wasted my money on this if i would have read the reviews 1st \( i usually do \) my son played with it for about 5 10 minutes and then asked why santa would bring him something like that in my opinion it was a huge waste of about 50 and gave santa a bad name with my son for bringing him such a piece of junk	22

1	this univeral dvd player comes packed very neatly in an oppo cloth case and is very sleek the finish of the dvd player is excellent however the remote is not up to snuff in this department this player can play pal dvds it upconverts it to ntsc 1080i it 's loaded with features that you probably wo n't see on most dvd players out there the upconversion works well though i'm not sure the color handling is the best the audio controls in the setup are awesome people have complained about the disc tray being flimsy cheap but i think it 's just fine it 's very quick to load and play you may want to keep the remote safely because if you lose or damage it you wo n't be able to control most of the features the hdmi cable that is included with the player is of good quality probably worth around fifty bucks in the market price to performance features you ca n't beat this universal dvd player buy one and you 'll know	22

0	although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa i find this book difficult to understand the difficulty seems to come from the authors' desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages this leads to a cryptic language where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words a thing which personally frustrated me	22

0	hallmark entertainment has made many movies from children 's books and this probably one of the worst based on both alice in wonderland and through the looking glass this movie stars many of the familiar faces of hallmark movies and children 's movies such as gene wilder miranda richardson martin short and whoopi goldberg the lead character of alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good the movie revolves around her and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression even the crying scenes seemed fake where is dakota fanning when you need her \? the cinematography costume and set design are spot on as usual for hallmark movies but the soundtrack was unnoticeable the only bright spot was the engaging song by gene wilder 's character all in all quite boring	22

1	for the 50 bucks you pay here you get the phone plus 300 minutes of airtime that 's not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere it would be 20 bucks and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately 20 some odd bucks or so plus tax so cost works about to be about the same frankly i see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere regarding the sim card i noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion a sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to esd electro static discharge just like computer ram is esd is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed i 'd bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows before you handle the sim card you should ground yourself by touching something metal otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with esd the phone itself is ok it 's basic emphasis on the basic i just transferred my mobile from a motorola v120c and notwithstanding the annoying 20 polyphonic ringtones on the c139 about the only edge the c139 has over the v120c is the color display please also note that c139 does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper imo motorola could have added a port to accomodate a usb interface to this model it was short sighted and just dumb not to considering the v120c also in the same price range has such a port voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time i only just had the phone activated on this past saturday \( 10 28 06 \) and it took over 5 hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone also it is an entirely new network in southern california the network this model tracfone uses is cingular suffice it to say i followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it does n't recognize my number and to input my voicemail number and around and around it goes i anticipate nothing but problems with technical support when i contact them they are very polite as customer service reps however they can barely speak or understand english i am envisioning hours of bs with the call i have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatsoever note to tracfone customer service reps from mexico who can barely communicate with your american consumers are most assuredly not tech support also i was n't overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging the v120c is actually more intuitive it 's much easier to use but the c139 does have one advantage in this regard text messages cost only 0 3 units versus on the v120c tracfone was deducting 0 5 units for each incoming and outgoing text message i'm not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone it should be one uniform deduction across the board consumers should contact tracfone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon bottom line is that i would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic led phone and wants an inexpensive phone with a much easier on the eyes color display inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for 20 bucks but if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility then get yourself a nokia 2126 for the same money you spend here the nokia is a better phone it has a usb port a speakerphone plus other extras and you probably wo n't have any trouble setting up the voicemail either	22
1	i dog is so fun to use ! all you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player 's headphone port and i dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker i dog 's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play his tail serves as a mute button but be careful because he does n't like you touching too often ! i dog will get sad if you do n't give him any music to listen to if you do n't have a digital player you can set i dog by your boombox or other music device and he can hear that way there are only two reasons why i did n't give i dog 5 stars \( 1 \) the internal speaker is n't very loud so you have to have your music player turned up quite high and \( 2 \) the battery cover on i dog 's back leg is really hard to get off you will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off	22
0	this is one creative way in which to recoup some of the loss incurred by buying this nightmare if you are one of the unfortunate who rent this waste of time \( like i was \) recommend that your local video store make one empty space on their shelves and toss this loser this 71 minute experience which feels more like 100 days of viewing hell is nothing more then a montage of artsy disjoined surreal scenes it quickly becomes boring after the first 5 minutes tedious after 10 minutes and downright irritating at around 15 minutes i actually made the mistake of suffering through to the end hoping that something magical would happen to make everything half way understandable this film could only appeal to the rare artistically elite filmgoer who finds anything as superficial as character development or cumbersome as plot layout simply uninspiring	22
0	while this is an attractive looking paper towel holder it is n't very functional at first glance it looks like it should work as implied 'spring loaded arm puts pressure on paper towel roll regardless of how many towels are on that roll at the time allowing you to easily rip off a single sheet with one hand' unfortunately this model does n't work that way at least not the one i received i started with a partial roll and it was obvious this would n't work so i put in an extra large roll of top quality \( very thick roll \) paper towels and still they do n't come close to reaching the spring loaded arm this arm is no more effective at preventing a number of sheets from pulling off the roll than the old wooden one i had with no arm at all i'm very disappointed before deciding on this model i had viewed some very similar models that were higher in price maybe this is a case of you get what you pay for if you are looking for a paper towel holder that looks nice and are not concerned about function it may be worth the price if you are looking for one that looks nice and can offer you an easy one sheet at a time with one hand quick pull i suggest you look for a different model this unit wo n't do that job	22

1	freddy krueger is held in hell after being killed by his daughter allevidence of his existence have been taken out of his hometown as far aselm street is concerned freddy never existed he is unable to return and wreak havoc freddy is able to free jason voorhess from hell jason almostimmediately takes up his machete and starts killing freddy 's children jason starts killing too frequently for freddy 's taste and he is forcedto make a return to stop jason upon the return of freddy the viewer is treated to a battle royal of thetwo forces of evil the knife glove of freddy against the machete of jasonmakes for some exciting fighting the final battle finally is settled on apeir on a lake the two most evil people on earth cut each other to peices you think that you have a victor in this classical battle but the finalscene leaves you wondering who really won this fight i believe that theyleft the movie open for a sequel fans of a nightmare on elm street and friday the thirteenth will be greatly entertained	22
1	i bought this as a halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004 he loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house he does n't really use it much anymore but now my 18 month old loves it ! he can actually follow the whole progression turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time this toy has been great for our family it is pretty durable some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore but considering what it has gone through it has performed amazingly well	22
1	this seems to be a secure seat and our almost 5 year old is comfortable in it the buckling system is a bit inconvenient you really have to get your head down there and put the strap in just right to get the side thingy snapped i wish our son could buckle himself in at this point but this seat makes it too hard it 's also not a seat you want to do air travel with as it 's unwieldy to carry around but all in all i would say it 's a good purchase	22
1	i purchased the kurt kenetic two months ago and am thrilled with its performance and quality if you are considering purchasing a trainer fluid trainers are the way to go basically there are four major types of trainers magnetic wind rim driven and fluid the later is the best hands down ! fluid resistance trainers are more quiet smoother and more realistic than any of the others mentioned the only drawback to the fluid trainer is that over time they can leak resistance fluid there are three companies that have solutions to this drawback i highly recommend that you research all three and test them out where possible a good review page is roadbikereview com the cycleops fluid 2 is ultra smooth and quiet they have a limmited warranty on thier products but are known for standing behind their trainers for life and will fix any issues probably for life ! the one up trainer has all the advantages of a fluid trainer but uses no fluid in its designe it is made in america and carries a life time warranty the kurt kinetic which i decided to purchase is imho the best because it utilizes a sealed fluid unit and therefore is guranteed not to leak these three units are roughly the same price around 260 00 steep \? think of it this way this product is going to be your companion for many winters so do n't buy a loud crappy one with crappy customer service ! you 'll regret later that you did n't spend the extra 75 or 80 on a quality product i also tested the blackburn fluid 100 bucks cheaper not bad for price but since it is new to the market i was unsure about durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration i have heard amazing testimonials of how cyclops kurt and one up have replaced parts and even whole trainers no questions asked ! google these three companies and see for yourself	22
1	i loved the idea and ease of the senseo but i was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted the grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety so i decided to take a chance and order the columbia blend from amazon i have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what i had been getting if you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor but still a strong tasting coffee give it a try ! i will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs 18 in the regular bags	22

1	i bought this cd on a whim after i heard joaquin phoenix was directing their tired of being sorry video whoa ! i was addicted ! i could n't stop listening to it i had to get a 2nd copy for the car just so i could stop carrying it back and forth great driving music ! the songs are catchy and have a great beat i have n't heard anything this good in a long while i had to have more immediately and luckily found some earlier stuff of scott thomas' more on the acoustic indie side but awesome ! i highly recommend lovers thieves \( cdbaby com \) my faves from ringside are struggle trixie and dreamboat 730 you will not be disappointed	22
1	going to barsetshire is a delightful book and a much needed accompaniment to the thirkell novels ms snowden obviously spent a great deal of time reading the 29 novels in thirkell 's barsetshire series and has produced a companion to the series that makes it very easy to keep track of the characters places and cultural references especially for an american who is not well versed in mid 20th century english esoterica i also enjoyed the writing style and the well chosen quotes in addition to the book 's comprehensive content is its straightforward layout and user friendly format this exemplary reference guide is not a flashy publishing house production but instead keeps with the simple charm of barsetshire in its quality and overall appearance the original cover art showing an idyllic barsetshire scene is lovely i heartily recomend the book to all thirkell fans	22

1	im a graphic design student in college so i really needed a camera i decided on this one and i am really glad i did the pictures are nice and clean the camera itslef is a very sleek looking one and is very compact the only downfall to this is that it eats batteries pretty quick but i just took them out when i wasnt using them buy this camera	22

0	i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2 0 gb compact flash card i like it but the flash card does n't slide in easily sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins to add insult to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk therefore they should work seamlessly together but pathetically they do n't i 'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing for comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly there is no give at all but instead is an effortless process not a quality reader other than that it works as expected surprisingly the reader does n't topple over as easily as i thought it would it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in removing the card is extremely easy that 's a one handed process eject the card from the pc 's drive and then remove it data transfer from the card to pc is very quick overall i'm glad to have it but it 's an annoyance to use it i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader	22
1	this toy was an instant success with my son who is six he figured out how to put together the track in minutes unlike other construction toys skyrail is not limited to one or two designs my son can create endless configurations including loop the loops that really work this toy is also easy to disassemble the track and connectors seem a little flimsy but so far after many many uses none of the pieces has broken	22
0	design is great and very comfortable but sound quality is poor people on the other side of the conversation constantly claim that sound mic is not clear or muffled find an alternate hands free piece	22
1	it 's an ok knife that picture of it can trick you if you look at the middle of the page it says we ship black if we are out of silver do n't get me wrong black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green the odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery so i hope you like black weapons the tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley just try not to poke an eye out when will you need a led light on a sword \? \? \? unless your fighting ninjas in the dark do you know why this weapon is so cheap \? i think that it 's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive just do n't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine p s if you 're looking at my account name i am not neil meislin but i am related to him	22

0	i ordered the smack and yack disney cars sally lightning and ramone for christmas the only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was ramone sally and lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour they would n't work at all i ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on christmas i hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases	22
1	we bought two of these we were very impressed how easy the set up was since installing the weather station we have enjoyed the accuracy of the weather station both inside and outside temperatures one feature of this weather station is a ice alert up here in north we do get freezing rain ice and snow this station has been right on thebutton with those predictions i would highly recommend the purchase	22
1	this is a high quality precision made piece i'm very particular about the construction of things that i buy and this peerless arm more than met my expectations it was easy to attach to the back of my 32 lcd television and equally easy to mount to the wall i read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble not so here everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen all hardware is included along with clear complete instructions i 'd be surprised if you could find something better	22
1	like the new look but am having problems making the transition jury still out	22
1	i 've been a subscriber for several years now i was trying to decide between maxim and stuff i chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining \( i e how to do doughnuts in your car ect \) they do have some photos of actors and such but many were of people from other countries and just other pretty girls you may have never heard of i would suggest this magazine	22
1	the bad news first the extension cables are very stiff and they 're shipped in a tight loop do n't expect them to straighten out easily and they do n't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps i just swap cables from whichever bowflex station i'm not using and get a much better feel the ball is a ball it does the job the little pump they supply with it is n't great but it also does the job maybe you 'll tone your arms pumping up the ball \) there 's no check valve in the ball so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in fast once it 's fully inflated the mat looks a bit cheap but it 's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around the video is decent even if you already know what you 're doing it 's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a bowflex so far i would n't say you 've even come close to justifying the purchase price but those foot straps are just brilliant ! once you 've gotten them adjusted they 'll go on and off with no problem making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum but once you have them secured they wo n't come off or even shift much when you 're performing the exercises that may sound like no big deal but i 've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements the four points for cable attachment are well placed and solid i 've been doing resistance stretches for a long time and these are the best straps i 've ever used they 're worth the price of admission	22

1	would highly recommend we attend dog show that are in the middle of no were this product got us to every show we have been to since we started using it in march 2007 we especially in enjoyed the feature of being able to find what kind of business were in the area were we hate getting lost especially with a truck loaded down with dogs and conformation equiptment this product has stopped that from happening it would be nice if the 2008 version 1 it spoke the name of the streets while it was giving you the next turn 2 it would get rid of that agreement screen everytime you use it once should be enough and 3 it would be nice if we could log on to the web and down load the latest addition of gas station place to eat and etc while we were down loading the construction updates this product is a good buy for the money	22
1	this is a very good product it keeps you from having to try to mix your own cinnamon and sweetener it 's good for a lot of things for those who ca n't have sugar my favorite is cinnamon toast i will reorder it when i am out of it it 's so nice to have something with splenda instead of aspartame	22

1	this is worth the money in the materials it is made out of alone i am not in the habit of writing reviews but this juicer earns it perhaps you are like me and have never used a juicer before you want to get one without taking out a small loan because you just do n't know if your that into it if so this is your juicer there are enough other reviews to give you a good idea of what your getting i just want to back those up with my experience this is a good strong product	22
1	being a fan of russ meyer movies since classics like mudhoney vixen and lorna it is amazing what happens when russ gets some money to make a movie for a major company likewise italian competitor tinto brass russ gets in feel with picturing erotic in a slight different way i liked this movie very much for it 's blooming 60 's pop feeling and great decent inszenation of the participated women i'm in general a fan of exploitation movies and this one is an especially great one presentated on dvd with a great transfer and lots of extras well done \( hope my english is half the way understandable sorry i'm german \)	22
0	dirty deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself this is idiotic but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll it 's silly it 's a teenager movie it 's been done a million times before in hollywood \( most of the time poorly \) dirty deeds is one of the sub par high schoolers making mischief attempts where if you 're perusing cable late one night and ca n't find anything else on your 500 channels is maybe worth a stop if you 're determined to watch tv instead of just going to bed but who knows you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers ! just look what 1980 's teeneager movie hollywood knights launched for the likes of michelle pfeiffer tony danza robert wuhl and fran drescher everybody 's got to start somewhere right \?	22
0	i have now been shipped two iskins for my 60gig and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place there are at least three flavors of 60 gig ipods in the marketplace at present and more coming it appears so be careful which one you order the manufacturer 's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin even if you know the model number of your ipod i also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake throw it away	22

1	this game has outstanding graphics and great 3 d gameplay plus you can really battle it out online or in instant action to add to the few you can play in the clone wars or the galactic civil war the bad thing though is that in the clone wars the main battles are on naboo to be honest the clone wars started on geonosis and are in episode ii not i i love this game because you can use guns and other awesome weapons and you can also play as the wookies clones droids rebels and imperials if you are a beginner video game player or new to star wars when you choose create file try using easy this game follows the movies really well and you can explore mos eisley or maybe naboo if you like the more battles you win the bonuses you get if you read the instruction booklet it says if you go on a killing spree against the enemies you get a really cool bonus i highly recommend this game to all star wars fans ! the game will let you play the most greatest battles of all time so if you want a good long lasting game try this i really hope star wars fans will love the game multi player mode is great and i really enjoy playing it this game is great and i love it try playing it for yourself ! i am about to wrap this review up so listen that this game is great for the xbox and has terrific gameplay and features that you will want to play it all the time even though it is online or single player you can still have fun and know it is all out star wars action ! this game is great and i just love playing it ! i know that this is one out of two battle front games soon to be three i enjoy playing this ! buy it now ! p s buy every thing star wars	22

0	there was a time when liberalism had a connotation of deep thinking tolerance and openness to healthy civil debate no longer and harper's is a perfect symbol for all that ails the left to call this magazine left leaning is a farce it does n't lean it completely totally enthusiastically and blindly tumbles and falls into the far left swamp the tone is often hysterically and shrilly partisan reflecting the ongoing deafness and disconnection that the leftist media elites have towards the mainstream of america the quality of the writing and feature selection has declined precipitously through recent years this rag is about as credible now as the guardian national enquirer or come to think of it the new york times ! save your money lol !	22
1	i used meyenberg powdered goat milk with my first litter of pups five years ago and was very pleased with it so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born i supplement the mother 's food with it and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food the pups and their mother seem to love it and have suffered no digestive problems at all it dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store i recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both	22

1	this dvd gives a very good 60 minute workout as others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy the first time i did it i felt a bit awkward with the steps but when i did it the second time i was able to follow along with no problems the dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine if someone like denise austin were leading this one i do n't think i would play along minna is by far my favorite instructor so i go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout i would n't want to do this every day but it is good to have something different in the rotation i think the toning section is excellent i am not looking to bulk up i just want my body to firm up and look better when i wear shorts and a tank top i like how she combines upper and lower body exercises it 's easy to follow and you feel like you hit every muscle area in 30 minutes i use 3 pound weights at this point and i can see where in the future i might be buying 4 pound weights minna is a great instructor she has excellent cueing and is very encouraging she is never annoying i also have her optimizer balanced blend dvd and i love that one	22
1	the chip works just as advertised i have had no problems with it it was easily formatted to my kodak camera and it stores a huge amount of pictures and video either about 280 pictures or almost an hour of video great product i would recommend it for anyone looking for a lot of storage space for a good price	22

0	if you buy this be sure to set a restore point before installing this may work if you have never installed any other anti virus software this is not for a novice computer user to install unless maybe you are installing on a brand new computer after uninstalling norton \( my previous anti virus software \) i installed kapersky and immediately had total system lockup with warning message from windows \( the old blue screen of death \) saying a serious problem had occurred and if i had recently installed new hardware or software to uninstall it which i did then logged onto the kapersky forum and was told to download a norton removal tool and run it and then reinstall i did this and still ended up with total lockup and warning message after three tries i gave up luckily i had set restore points and was able to get my system back and am now back to using norton according to the forum there are also problems if you have installed mcafee i am running windows xp since i never got to use it i ca n't judge whether it has any value	22

0	we had a heated pad for years that finally played out it was wonderful wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one i bought this item i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it i was suspect when i opened it poor quality material poor bed fit very very warm on the lowest setting after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires which are quite large in my ribs it had to come off i had rather be cold and i hate being cold	22
1	first off let me start by saying that i really like my summit watch it is large \( some may go so far to call it huge \) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist and quite comfortable to wear those with bad eyesight will still be able to see the easy to read digital readout of the time barometric pressure altitude and compass the numbers are quite big so they are difficult to miss the altitude reading measures in increments of 1 foot which is about as good as you can get i like that but what i really like about the highgear watches that i have n't seen in other brands which offer similar features is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be no kidding this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny partly cloudy or raining pretty dang nifty if you ask me the barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather however after months of use i have to say that my little watch is way more accurate than my local tv weatherman i 'd say somewhere around 75 of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually are not bad it 's a feature i would very much like to have on my suunto and casio models with similar functions until then i 'll rely on my trusty \( and much cheaper \) highgear summit if you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass altitude and barometer functions before making that specific buy do some homework and wherever possible seek out a store where you can actually see the watches in person being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase find the best price and pull the model out and actually try it on before you buy for me the highgear summit was a good purchase however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package try the highgear axis or possibly the more stylish but much more compact \( and way more expensive \) suunto observer either way doing a little homework will pay off in the end happy hiking and i hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product good luck	22

0	i'm a compleat beatlemaniac and i do n't mind the political statements at all but this is a nearly unlistenable record that i have a hard time counting as a serious musical effort or even a real album i would have loved it if it had been a 7 single woman is the nigger of the world with the rest of it just words written in liner notes after that opening track the remainder is a serious chore to get through it 's almost unimaginable that this came out between the excellent imagine \( 1971 \) and the solid mind games \( 1973 \) but then again john was not consistent in part surely due to his apparent and admirable lack of commitment to being a pop star love john for the genius he was his commitment to peace and the great music he made it 's just that there 's barely any of it on this particular record	22

1	rock n' roll history has many example of band artists unlucky that did n't get the recognition they deserve here 's one what is big star about \? a rock n' roll slightly psychodelic most influenced by beatles and the byrds the first record \( 1 record 1972 \) is the battle of two frontman putting one classic pop rock tune after another chilton gets the most rock stuff chris the ballads and also a contribution from hummel the hippy india song best moments in the streets thirteen india song when my baby 's beside me my life is right the second album radio city 1973 chris left the band claiming that chilton was getting too much control of everything for this record hummel contributes more the band goes torward some stuff slightly different like the soul intended o my soul \( maybe a reflection of the record label atmosphere chilton here also takes full control of the musical direction the albm sounds not better or worse but less laboured sounding in some tracks more like a rehearsal with a great garage feeling stevens goes great on drums specally on back of a car best tracks way out west life is white \( although the harmonica annoys me a little \) mod lang \( very bowie mood \) back of a car september gurls at a glance big star reminds me backing home from school playing my guitar calling my girlfriend on the phone and waiting for the weekend to go to the beach a feeling of youthness that does n't come back just like those special moments in a band 's career that later they ca n't catch anymore no matter how hard they try for big star no differ they would never do anything like these two records and sadly after bell 's death chances are zero to none why did n't they succeeded well ego stuff lack of stax knowledge to deal with rock n' roll bands and the dicotomy that was ruling the rock n' roll scene at the time hard rock versus progressive rock and what about big star \? neither hard rock nor progressive but despite all that rubish big star is pure rock n'roll guitar band 70 's style recognizable in many current bands recording all over the world big star is eternal	22
0	i have been using turbotax since i started working full time after graduating form college this year turbotax really drops the ball 1 \) i did n't have any espp transactions for a few years tax year 2006 i had some and that was when i realized that nowadays they force you to use turbotax premier for espp calculations the last time i had espp in 2000 or so the deluxe version at that time could assist you to calcuate espp transactions with wizards now you ca n't with deluxe version 2 \) for first time married filed joinly couples they have to do a lot of work trying to merge their filed single returns from 2005 the deluxe version simply does not handle this at all even if it helps you transfer the 2005 returns they do n't merge the data properly for instance if both couple have short long term capital loss carryovers from 2005 the deluxe version does not do that for you same for state local taxes paid refunded worse if even if you try to correct it sometimes you ca n't there is obvious bugs and i have to choose override from the menu to directly update the forms 3 \) nitpick when you choose to print out the every forms by default they print out all those only for federal taxes i have to go to the state tab and choose my state go back to the print menu to print state tax forms i am not sure it that may be because this year is the first year i use the mac version of turbotax \( i use pc versions before \) but i really do not have a good tax preparation experience this year next year i may consider to switch	22

0	there is an interesting comparison to be made between ingmar bergman 's classic the virgin spring and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired last house on the left by wes craven they share identical plots feature graphic rape scenes and before it 's all over turn average men into murderers and yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961 's oscar winning best foreign film and the other appreciated only in underground circles but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation so just how different are they \? not as different as you might imagine but as different as art and exploitation the virgin spring is easily one of bergman 's most accessible films telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion he exposes a frankness and brutality people were n't accustomed to seeing a young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy though they initially seem helpful their actions quickly become violent after a graphic \( for the time \) rape the girl is murdered later the wrongdoers happen upon the girl 's home and seek shelter from her family both groups unaware of who the other is suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought it is a powerful tale of love loss and the depths people can be driven into where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code where savagery and rage take over bergman 's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by max von sydow as the father real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it 's a winning combination but what endures in the story of the virgin spring is how strong a component faith becomes when there is nothing left to believe in can you still believe \? a classic in every sense the virgin spring still has the power to shock but there 's something very redemptive about the film last house on the left however is probably more notorious than acclaimed the plot as i 've said is identical coming 12 years later in 1972 wes craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale it is a shocker and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the torture cinema of today it is brutal uncompromising and graphic and the film was championed in the underground horror market working with a small budget the film lacks the artistry of the virgin spring while it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock what it lacks is depth and subtlety the characters are n't particularly drawn out so their actions do n't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film without contemplating faith and moral choices what we 're left with is straightforward revenge and the film ultimately has no redemption no uplift it 's violence for the sake of violence it remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it 's own right and therein lies the difference between art and exploitation kgharris 11 06	22

1	there is little more i can contribute to this literary masterpiece even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work gustave flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected madame bovary with care he worked on the novel for nearly six years during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times often spending days perfecting a single paragraph the result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty madame bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine emma bovary as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth she exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle class humdrum lifestyle flaubert 's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal in perfect contrast to emma flaubert introduces charles bovary a proto typical doctor who has no real talent or ambition and is content to enjoy the simple things that life has to offer soon after their wedding emma becomes disillusioned by the bumbling charles and yearns for a romantic interlude flaubert represents the absolute clich of provincial life with his portrayal of this undemanding unimpressive and unnoticed middle class man flaubert brings all facets of human personas full circle with the shy well mannered and well liked young man next door leon with a slow blossoming relationship with emma leon leaves for paris to study law upon his return and with a little experience the two become lovers flaubert 's portrayal of this dysfunctional couple is reminiscent of tragic romances of yore thereafter the degeneracy of emma 's lifestyle is evident and she is brought to the brink of destruction in madame bovary gustave flaubert gives us a vivid and life like glance into the reality and the mannerisms and the customs of small town people living in france during the mid nineteenth century flaubert 's descriptions are detailed and beautiful and paint a real portrait of the natural world he is describing opening with first person narration that sometimes shifts to third person has earned gustave flaubert the reputation as one of the most celebrated and influential novelists of the nineteenth century	22

1	one of the few of these type of items available on the market i bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews i had received some free drives from newegg \( seagate \) and needed to house them this was a no brainer set up the utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off \( xp pro sp2 \) the firmware was one rev prior so i updated it absolutely smooth as silk reformatted the drives i chose the raid 1 option and ext3 format i like the fact that you can specify raid size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume the drive is fairly solid the fan is not very noisy the front slide up access door is a little kludgy good user interface i was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen raid and ext3 the only thing i can never get to work and it is 100 my lack of knowledge is the email alerts i could n't get infrant to do it and same with this one as an aside i love amazon and newegg great retailers both of them	22

1	product is excellent does what it says and then some instruction for installation and operating are very easy to follow \( a winner in my book \) i had issues unrelated to this product running into problems with the stereo i was using in the fact that it did n't have outputs for audio so i was forced to use the headphone jack which required further purchasing adapters for the rca cable was a bit frustrating but had nothing to do with this product i converted 2 albums last night into wav files cleaned them up with the audio cleaner included in the software used the editing ripper included to split the 1 recording into separate tracks actually the software does that for you but you have the option to preview there start and ending points for each of the tracks in case it may be off i only had minor adjustments the ripper was pretty much on the money overall i then downloaded the encoder recommended to work with this software and converted the wav files into mp3 's with no problem this is an excellent buy for those out there looking to do there own audio transfer of lp 's and cassettes the sound is excellent on playback	22

0	here 's my theory in regards to how one should rate a remix album if a song is remixed then that remix should be better than the original song otherwise what 's the point \? with that being said nu mixx klazzics is pretty much pointless this is nothing more than a cash in album the people at death row koch know that folks will continue to buy pac 's music as long as you can manage to put a new spin on it \( especially the die hards they 'll buy anything associated with the man \) well the spin they put on this particular album is just plain terrible if you have the source material stick with that these remixes do n't make the originals better they actually make them worse the beats sound like throw away beats from an old jt tha bigga figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered changed so that they sound updated \( removing snoop from 2 of amerikka 's most and distorting pac 's vocals when he says his name is just terrible \) but these changes are only for the worst in short all aspects of this album are sorry the guests are wack and the beats are generic hollow clubby beats remember y'all when these albums were dropped back in '96 the beats had more meat to them there is one decent track though life goes on gets a different look and i'm not so sure that it 's all that bad i find it tolerable but i could see why why someone would n't like it but this is coming from someone that was n't all that crazy about the original because i was n't feeling the beat if you enjoyed the original then stick with that also i like that the original version of hit 'em up was used here in this version 'pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that he was cool with \( thus proving that he was n't anti east coast just anti bad boy \) whoever gave the green light to have this released should be fired it 's a shame that folks are pimping tupac 's music like this but they 'll continue to do it as long as folks continue to buy it i'm drawing the line here shame on you suge your label is n't relevant anymore get over it and move on standout tracks do n't even waste your time looking for an	22

1	brain builder is a series of visual and auditory exercises aimed at improving attention concentration and memory this consists of seven exercises one involving visual reaction speed and accuracy and six memorizing a sting of randomly generated numbers presented audiably or visually in one of three modes base \( straightforward \) reverse \( you must give back the string in reverse the order given \) and flash \( visual numbers presented one at a time instead of all at once like base \) or random \( auditory where you cope with numbers being read at an uneven pace \) you are then immediately tested by having to type in what those were there is no time limit on response you progress to higher levels which means memorizing more numbers faster during the viewing or listening from an initially determined baseline test taken when first starting different voices men women adults and children read the auditory presentations all and all i found it to be fairly sophisticated and the exercises do seem help even beyond matters of number memorization the primary shortcoming seemed to be the lack of feedback or coaching other than telling you not to get discouraged and to keep working hard also the progress summeraries \( bar graphs \) fail to take into account the higher levels for scoring purposes so day to day comparison of results seems too flat overall i have enjoyed the program and have stuck with it although there are some days i wish for more variety and to do something else than just repeat numbers what they say about only having to practice about 10 minutes a day well i 've had to spend more like 30 minutes or more to do enough exercises to feel satisfied with my progress	22

1	disney made its mark as a major studio in 1937 with its first full length feature film snow white and the seven dwarves ironically given this early success snow white was their only hit movie for the next 13 years world war ii kicked the hell out of disney 's overseas markets even movies today regarded as classic disney pinnochio bambi fantasia lost money on initial release disney eked through by diversifying into training films for the us government and the south american films that were part of fdr 's good neighbor policy etc stuff that made back its costs but not much more by 1948 disney was in dire financial straits they had just enough money for one more movie walt disney realized he needed a hit or his studio probably would n't survive and it would have to be what they did best a full length animated feature film walt said to himself what we need is a movie about a girl in trouble audiences love that they loved snow white that 's what he wanted a movie like snow white but even more so more comedy more drama more magic more music more lovable characters he chose as the basis of his company 's hail mary pass arguably the most famous fairy tale in the world cinderella disney did n't have the money as they had on earlier films to lavishly storyboard every scene thus they hit upon the wonderfully clever idea of shooting the entire movie in live action then the animators used stills from that as storyboards the photos used survive to this day and many are provided as a special edition extra in some cases these photos have the animator 's drawings over them turning for instance an almost bare stage into a hall in cinderella 's family chateau in 1950 cinderella was released and was everything disney so desperately needed even today cinderella is arguably the best movie disney 's ever made it 's just awfully hard to argue with any aspect of this film the animation artwork was a product of disney 's famous nine old men at that time not yet old cinderella pulls off superbly something not particularly easy to do it integrates believable human characters with funny cartoon animals and makes it work from eric larson and marc davis' beautiful and graceful cinderella to ward kimball 's wonderful jaq and gus gus the mice and over the top lucifer the cat everything flows together so well it all seems perfectly natural part of walt disney 's plan to out snow white snow white with cinderella involved its music he very consciously wanted cinderella to be a source of hit songs there had been hit songs from disney films before \( heigh ho and whistle while you work from snow white when you wish upon a star from pinnochio etc \) but they 'd been almost accidental oh we have a hit song well that 's nice for cinderella disney for the first time went to tin pan alley \( 28th street in new york city where the professional songwriters could be found \) disney wanted his girl 's music done by the very best craftsmen the guys who wrote hit songs for a living the cinderella soundtrack hit big \( a 1 album with 3 4 million units sold \) with songs even today considered quintessential disney most notably a dream is a wish your heart makes from the movie 's opening scene the work song while the animals help cinderella clean the house and simultaneously build her ball gown and bibbidi bobbidi boo \( nominated for an academy award as best movie song of the year \) from the fairy godmother transformation scene for their best movie disney apparently spared no expense producing the dvd not only has the picture quality been digitally restored but the audio has also been cleaned up with a new 5 1 surround sound mix totally gone is the background hiss associated with so many old movies \( cinderella has the distinction of being the noisiest movie ever restored according to its audio crew \) the original mono soundtrack has also been spruced and is provided as an option for purists a word about the movie 's aspect ratio \( i e how wide the picture is compared to its height \) the dvd cover says cinderella is presented in its original full screen aspect ratio \( 1 33 1 \) this is untrue virtually all sound films until 1953 including cinderella were 1 37 1 since a tv screen is 1 33 1 you do n't lose a lot when the original is formatted to fit your television i just wish they had n't lied about it cinderella ends at breakneck pace we go straight from her foot sliding into the glass slipper to the wedding to happily ever after bing bang boom walt disney believed audiences like a happy ending but they do n't like a happy ending that goes on too long hey who am i to argue \? well maybe i 'll argue a dvd extra addresses scenes originally planned for the movie but not actually used one of these would have occurred after the fitting of the glass slipper and before the wedding cinderella is taken by the grand duke to the castle in her normal everyday clothes the first time prince charming sees her since the ball she 's not wearing a lovely gown she 's wearing her scullery maid outfit cinderella is frightened how will he react when he realizes she 's not a fine lady but a poor servant girl \? and of course he does n't care how she 's dressed he loves her anyway i can see that scene in my mind it would have worked beautifully this is the one way in which an almost perfect movie could have been even a tiny bit better	22
1	this is another praise for the game rolled into the other praises by now you 've read the synopsis by others your character the prince \( or one of his cousins \) rolls an orb \( i e katamari \) which collects every object in the level this game works on many levels it is first and foremost absurd and bewildering the introductory animations and cut scenes are off the wall yet amusing the incessant rolling is cathartic and addictive the bonuses involve finding hidden presents and cousins in the level there are many variations on the rolling theme in the game \( roll a sumo wrestler into food roll a snowball onto a snowman roll fireflies into a kid 's reading light time trials etc \) but the most satisfying is the original premise of rolling everything and anything into as large a ball as possible once you start to consume people trucks skyscrapers ships clouds etc then you feel very powerful music is very catchy something vacant from many video games my only criticism the cooperative two player mode can venture into frustration quite easily my wife and i played who are both good at the game but you often find yourself awkwardly and slowing moving where you want and that 's part of the problem where you want to roll may not be where the other person wants to roll so communicate well	22

0	this camera looks cool but it 's so so not cool the people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves this is by far one of the worst products i have ever purchased ever by the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place it clips on but not for long the camera 's internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow it 's complelety unreadable even with a 150mb card i could only take a few short quality videos you can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings and i'm talkin' low quality worse than any video you 've seen online more problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it the controls and interface are not intuitive you 'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep oh and the earbuds that come with the camera mp3 player hunk o junk are huuuuge they are n't comfortable in the least and the cord is too short i had the camera in my pocket and when i stood erect the earphones were violently yanked from my ears they 're obviously intended for oompa loompas i'm sure i could have found more problems with this thing but it eventually died on me for no reason do n't waste your time with this you will be sorely disappointed in fact if i could give this product a rating of 10 stars i would do so i'm so extremely disappointed with this camera	22

1	lagaan is a masterpiece the setting the music the full range of singing the craving for love all provide stimulating background for the depth of a plot which portrays a strong young man with failth in himself and his refusal to be ground under by external forces beyond his control you the reader must step up to the wicket sooner than you may realize and defend the slim sticks of your belief in defense of the innate dignity of mankind	22

0	i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe then another meanwhile fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose ninety percent of the books i 've read have been secular but i'm starting to read more christian novels but to me this book fails for three reasons the marriage conflict between mark and allie is n't believable the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing mark and allie 's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he has n't convinced her otherwise seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery but it is grounds for suspicion yet allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight instead mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie throughout the book references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie allie refers to mark 's act as adultery and recalls him lying his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie their marriage is struggling but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book mark says he did n't have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies later in the novel blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late the serial killer story is poorly done and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book when they book a suspect at the end it seems ridiculous the police work feels like it was written by an amateur one line in the novel as much as the evidence pointed to xxx stan did n't want to believe it in my opinion the evidence did n't point to that person and stan the detective seems foolish for believing it there is n't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story there is no sense of setting in the book there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other finally this book talks about god and prayer and being saved throughout the book and that 's great with a serial killer on the loose a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way at one point a conversation goes like this how can the murder be part of god 's plan \? maybe it is n't that would mean god is n't in control he is in control but he allows some things to happen then at another point mark says to allie i'm going to be fine it 's time to trust the lord he 's taken care of us so far then allie says but i do n't know what his plan is i do n't know how he wants this to end i do n't know what he wants to teach us at other points in the book characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god 's plan and that through god 's plan all things can be used for good this line of logic is infuriating bad things happen to everyone including god 's people god does n't allow a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife that 's a horrible message to send to a non christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck telling them it was part of god 's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians but like above where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson god does n't willfully kill people it comes down to the simple fact that all people including serial killers and christians have choices to make and have free will i'm surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book	22

0	sometimes you just have to spend the money to get the superior product buy from pottery barn and order additional covers from them as well same pillow but the fleece like cover exclusively at pottery barn is actual luxury more comfortable for mom and baby wears amazingly well due to thickness and stains lift right out we have used one cover continuously for over 4 months and it 's still like new in another class from the chintzie alternatives offered at other stores	22
0	these shoes are cute but 1 \) they are made wide 2 \) the heel is a little bigger than 2 3 \) they are uncomfortable to walk in i think i could find a better pair at wal mart if i had to the company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a big two thumbs down for that	22
0	not really impressed with this product it applies okay but the colors look really bright and odd on the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product i like lancome 's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice	22
1	saveur has been a guilty pleasure for me for some time guilty because it is hard to take serious a magazine with such a hoity sounding name and admittedly some of the travel and food stories are just on the edge of self indulgent self concious behaviour they laugh at me at home \( or used to \) for reading it what makes it good is the content the cover story each issue is usually a destination article focused on a particular area and its food \( cuisine is the wrong word here \) written in a personal vein with beautiful photos and this is the heart of the magazine but the other content is equally beautiful and it is amazing how many of the recipes actually are useful and have become mainstays for me not just something good looking hide the cover if you must but i think this is the best foodie magazine	22

0	while my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun content of the books in this set i felt it was disappointing as a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too quickly the first book is just letters and letter sounds very introductory the second book introduces three letter words right off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends that was ok to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words but by page 2 we were already leaping to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were already introducing a sight word does and a double consonant word cannot i thought the pace was frustrating for my son i was hoping expecting a book devoted to just blends and or 3 letter words instead this program is organized by vowels with the letter a being introduced first i do n't see that as a problem but i was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3 and sight words coming later like maybe book 4 unfortunately you ca n't see exactly what your getting until you open the box nonetheless the audio is entertaining for children with music and humor thrown in and the reward stickers poster and ribbon are a fun way to recognize your child 's achievement the practice game is basically just like the word whammer fridge phonics product but with cards instead of magnets	22
1	the computer game version of the number devil closely follows the book as kids progress through sections on prime numbers the fibonacci series pascal 's triangle and an infinite series approaching one nine of the ten games worked well for us but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth the arrow game we understood the math but could n't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows this was disappointing because we could never reach the bonus section all in all though this is a good investment for a child 8 or up who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers	22
1	purchased as a just in case and i hope i'm never in a situation where i will need to use it but at least i feel safer knowing it 's there i 've only tested this on pieces of wood and plexiglass and it works as it should this tool was also highlighted on an episode of mythbusters on the discovery channel in a submerged car myth they demonstrated how a tool just like this one and the lifehammer both worked perfectly on the side window of a submerged car so i'm sold on this tool 's ability	22

0	unfortunately there seemed to be no recourse after i ordered this for 2 newphews as a christmas gift and it did not arrive i tried to send an email to amazon com but got bumped to someone else \( distributor \? \) who never responded so disappointing since it was a gift for someone else happened not once but twice	22
0	i'm here to find replacement parts for this toy my daughter was working really hard to try to make something work on this and right when she got it together one of the wires attached to the light broke off when she tried to put it into the coil to make the connection we ca n't solder it back in there are no replacement parts and my daughter is crying at the kitchen table and we do n't want to order another one just to make her happy seriously this toy is a piece of crap i gave the toy high marks for educational value because it teaches kids an important lesson once corporations have your money they do n't care about whether or not you actually were able to use it or have fun or will need replacement parts they only want to get more money off you somehow also buyer beware is an important lesson	22

0	man i do n't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking but it should be illegal ! this is first off a terrible dvd 4 3 \( full screen \) format with a dark muddy picture worse the plot is typical predictable and poorly written other than looking for glimpses of teri hatcher 's body sitting through this fiasco is a total bore i was also surprised at how bad teri 's acting was in this movie since i 've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this that is probably the fault of the director erik anjou a third rate director \( at best ! \) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary gee i wonder why he is n't in more demand \( not ! \) ! i can enjoy b movies and bad movies but this one is just so totally non involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at i ca n't imagine that this mess was released on dvd for any reason other than to cash in on teri hatcher 's current popularity and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger \( 29 year old \) teri hatcher nude rent this if you must but wow there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad	22

1	i eat one of these twice a week before i play ice hockey i specifically buy this flavor because it contains caffeine though i do n't perceive any boost it could be there and i'm just not noticing it i feel they do the job of keeping me fueled for the workout it would be nice if the package made a specific recommendation about how long before a workout to eat the clif bar i find the size of a clif bar a bit disappointing especially considering the store price of 1 50 at 11 a case and with free shipping when spending 25 or more i 've not found a better price than amazon 's on clif bars	22
0	this is the worst ripoff of a major literary work i have ever seen it takes colossal gall \( to say nothing of immense bad taste \) to take the bare bones of a dostoevsky novella tack on every possible bodice ripper cliche in movies then try to interweave dostoevsky 's own personal travails as narrative interstices all done with no flair for nor flavor of the original the acting is strictly mid 20th century nyah ha ha masterpiece theater while the casting is about as suitable as ray winstone in his infamous henry viii turn i got this just to see the great luise rainer now i will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed	22
0	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be 1 in ranking often the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant or does n't make sense or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats the magazine also seems to be biased some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful after further reading of many issues you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers for example you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically trash and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews ultimately its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period its the pat robertson of auto magazines if it were possible i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star	22
0	the epson r2400 is a purely photo printer be sure to understand this before you buy so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it think again the k3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k3 ink compatibility with the plain paper all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality not at least not on premium quality photo paper perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore this is hint 1 hint 2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol the only option you have is to order the ink online trust amazon as they can find and deliver however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges cartridges certainly dont last very long and at 12 15 each with eight of them your burning 100 125 a set bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k3 inks will be imitated if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you however at 850 i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper i have n't been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon amazon 's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here	22
0	bought two of these one as a gift and one for myself luckily i tried mine out before i gave the other away this thing just vibrates no massage at all ! ! after 30 seconds you get nausea its not worth 23 99 its a piece of junk trust me you are not getting a bargain i guess you pay for what you get but in this case i ca n't even say that because in no way will this help someone with a bad back or someone who needs a rub	22
1	for someone who knows little about bach and wants to learn something you could n't do better than to give them this cd ormandy and the philadelphia orchestra give their signature warm plush sound to the work of the great johann sebastian bach making him sound very nearly like a romantic rather than a baroque or classical composer this is not a bad thing some complain that bach with his mathematical leanings leaves them cold that is n't possible with the inviting material on this cd	22

0	who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange i love beef jerky especially peppered and hot spicy varieties but this jerky lacks the chewy ness that i expect in a quality beef jerky this stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy grainy consistency the flavor is n't bad but after reluctantly finishing the first bag i ca n't bring myself to open the second one perhaps i was n't paying proper attention but i was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in brazil i would not have purchased it if i had known this	22
0	this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen the characters are unlikeable except for charity 's two friends the songs are far too long and i had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull i was especially disappointed with big spender because i love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from bob fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar the only redeeming factor was that sammy davis jr was in it he 's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid this was my first shirley maclaine film and on the back it said that sweet charity was her best movie i have no desire to see her other movies then	22
1	twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor normally i would n't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time yet twinings seems to hold up well i love tea would drink 24 7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them	22
1	we bought my son a couple of starfighters the tri fighter the at rt and the wheel bike he loves the starfighters and likes the at rt a little he rarely plays with the wheel bike i think the starfighters are just simpler sturdier and easier to play with the wheel bike \( and to a smaller extent the at rt \) are more complicated and thus less fun for a 5 year old we run around having mock dog fights with the starfighters but poor old general grievous sits in the toy box overall probably good for older kids who can more expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff but not all that fun for the younger guys	22
0	i bought these for my younger than three month old son he did n't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt i ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together i do not suggest that anyone buy these	22

1	i received my original new native sling as a baby shower gift back in 1997 i wore it nearly every day for 15 months and then again with babies 2 and 3 now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn \( we have the purple one \) so i thought it time to buy a second sling the original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we 'll still use it but i'm a bit tired of the purple color after nine years ! \) pros this sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you it 's a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily men do n't mind wearing it \( at least my husband did n't \) it comes in basic solid colors and does n't scream baby ! when you 're out and about many people could n't tell i was wearing the baby when she was little it 's a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse once you figure that out it 's more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler \( i 've even used it with two year olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller is n't an option \) you can carry the baby on your front or back \( with experience this is doable but mostly for older babies \) on your hip \( once your baby can sit strongly \) it 's also easy to throw in the wash when the baby 's diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it \( no complicated latches webbing or snaps to clean \) cons if you get the wrong size the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt my original is the large size \( based on chest measurements from the manufacturer \) but i'm going to order a medium this time my husband still likes the large but he has a longer torso than i newborns may need some support in the new native sling otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric i always use a tightly rolled up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first then lay the baby 's head and back on top of it this pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you do n't feel like she 's lost in there usually i only do this for the first few weeks after a while your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people the trickiest thing with the new native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps you have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it if you can master this the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all day babywearing highly recommended ! good value for your money	22
1	i purchased this tea with scepticism because i am a big rooibus fan i get organic rooibus tea loose and brew it strong with cream in general i think rooibus is a good tea that stands on its own does not need additions however in this case rooibus was used as a base for a nice clean herbal tea blend the flavor of rooibus is just the base note congratulations to tazo for their light touch with hibiscus if this tea is brewed properly 4 minutes max it is light and refreshing the touch of rosemary really adds a nice freshness to the blend if you brew it too long it does decline into a sourness that overshadows the subltety of the other flavors i use this when i want a simple herbal tea with no milk	22
0	every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor actress in it that everything will turn out good blue steel is one of those movies jamie lee curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties \( or should i say murders \) which she did not commit sounds like an interesting plot right \? it would be had the script not been so poorly written the supporting actors give such a bland typical performance that not even jamie lee could have saved the dialogue aside from the acting the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop \( jamie lee \) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her so why do i give blue steel an extra star \? well i 'll just say that if you are a fan of jamie lee curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television just do n't pay over 3 to rent it and certainly do n't buy it	22

0	i 've had this phone for approx 9 months now maybe longer and i truly do n't know how i 've stood using this dual phone system for so long however tonight i 've taken a giant step upward towards better quality and design with the panasonic kx tg 5432m dual system this dual handset is the worst i 've ever experienced in a cordless system from the moment i set it up the static has been atrocious step away from the base unit over ten feet and it sounds like someone gargling gravel or a mad cat hissing in your ear i ca n't even step into my attached garage to talk with someone without major static to the point of not even being able to be heard by the other person even within six feet of the base i receive intermittent static that becomes obnoxious and distracting not only to me but to the other person on the other end for they hear it too i will never purchase another uniden product if this is the non quality of product they put out i had a 2 4 mhz system that would outshine this system and i wish i 'd never gotten rid of it as the title says if you desire a lot of static when you talk on a phone this is the system you need to bring that crackling symphony of music to your ear the melodic consistancy this system creates in ones enjoyment of talking on the phone will not put you to sleep but rather increase your aggravation of dealing with what sounds like a major electrical storm going on inside your head uniden should be ashamed of this product stepping down from the soapbox now	22
0	or in their entire career for that matter i have tried to like this band but greg dulli just wo n't shut up every song is his snide lyrical diatribing on and on and on the guitarist keeps things mildly interesting but on this album in particular the drummer also wo n't shut up and play a straight beat for once it 's like three guys in their own worlds and they mash it together and call what they 've done songs except for the one decent song they did the only rock song i can think of that is hard psychedelic passionate powerful and set to a waltz beat of all things let me lie to you is the best song they ever made because everyone in the band is given room to breathe by the song 's framework and tempo instead of piling in on top of each other till the end of the song like they usually seem to do everyone agrees to hold back until the rushing choruses and it 's less muddled and better orchestrated for it it 's a shame they did n't do any other songs like this at least none that i have heard i tried to like them i really did i wanted to find the band that made that one song and discover a whole treasure chest of dark passionate noisy music like that too bad no wonder they drifted apart	22

1	i got this for my 3 year old niece she loves it and requests that it go with her all the time the box to hold all the pieces is handy the magnets are easy and there 's lots of variations of outfits having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends parents etc to play along and interact the only cons i see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy it could use a handle and the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit all in all a great gift and toy !	22

0	nothing in this book was usable for me okay very little if i was trying to write the next ethan frome then this book would be perfect instead i write sci fi and fantasy i was looking for tips to improve my description of things this book recommends describing different things too much emphasis on metaphor \( which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious \) if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate this book might be a waste of your time however poets and pure literary writers might find it more useful than i did	22
1	this is my favorite film bar none mpi home video is releasing this title on dvd 5 15 07 according to mpi 's official site in addition as of this writing \( feb 07 \) this stellar film is showing in theatrical re release in as many as 30 american cities this film has everything an epic should have a first rate cast beautifully written screenplay spectacular \( and mostly historically accurate \) settings even solid humor i 've been waiting for this to be released on dvd for years	22

1	my 13 year old cat was limping for a few days off and on and my vet said it was probably arthritis a friend had told me that giving her arthritic dog nutramax cosequin had helped him and i already knew that regular cosequin has helped me with my arthritis so i bought a box of nutramax cosequin for cats from my vet for my kitty to try it really made a difference ! he stopped limping and could walk farther and faster on our walks together around our lake he was so happy and so was i on my vet 's recommendation i continued giving him one tuna flavored capsule each day sprinkled over his food as a good preventative to slow further joint deterioration all without the side effects which he might have gottten from prescription medication i would highly recommend this product for cats and dogs as a first line of treatment for arthritis and buying it from amazon saved me about 2 3 of the cost from the vet	22
1	i was a bit afraid after reading the reviews but this game is a hit with kids all ages it takes about 3 minutes to set up but it 's not hard and the bees do n't fall thru we played more times than i can count this past week and everyone enjoyed i bought it for my 5 year old but her cousins \( ages 19 17 and 13yo \) joined in the fun and actually asked to play my husband and i also got a kick out of it ! even our 3yo loved it but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull randomly at leaves and none dropped she 's good ! our child did n't get bored while we were setting it back up but everyone was sticking leaves and talking so i guess it depends on your children 's patience or attention span in a few words we all loved it	22

0	some assembly is required i consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things i have an engineering degree i 've put together bikes furniture installed car stereos and this thing was an absolute pain especially for such a simple device i found the instructions to be woefully inadequate i found the images to be useless and the instructions leave out fairly critical steps like how to orient various pieces together takes 10 times longer to install then it would if they had taken the effort to provide more guidance it was aggravating enough to make me go straight to amazon upon finishing to leave feedback i did n't even buy it from amazon the gate itself is fine	22
1	i was really surprised to read some of the other reviews about this product it 's as we we 've purchased entirely different programs in my experience with this software i 've found it to be extremely smooth running and user friendly from installation to printing and the card selection and customization is second to none there have been perfect cards for every occasion to date and we 've customized them countless ways adding and editing photos moving text sending ecards you name it ! navigating within the art studio is very intuitive printing cards from the sofware is very easy and the on screen configuration works great unlike some of the other reviews i have n't had the problem of having to re configure every time i print we set it up once and that was it i 've printed on card stock paper which turns out gorgeous and we 've also printed the quarter fold plain letter size which also looks great and works perfect with size a2 envelopes \( this is a great printing option if you do n't want to buy card stock paper ! \) i 've used this software on all of my computers have recommended it to many people and so far have not yet encountered or heard of any problems i highly recommend it it 's a fun program the recipients will love their customized cards and it will save you money in the long run	22

1	while these recorders are considered old fashioned by electronic geeks they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape he still insisted he could n't remember anything but had to admit it was his voice and that he being the model of honesty and truth must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke very effective these old fashioned recorders	22

0	if you can learn to dance by reading a book whose recommendation was to hold your partner and quot move to the music quot then you may find quot kaizen event implementation manual quot useful this book talks about the history and terminology of lean manufacturing and does go into detail about team member selection after that this book shows blank forms of some of the data analysis forms often used during a kaizen event but tells you nothing of how to complete the forms and analyze the results nor is there any quot road map quot or guidelines for conducting a kaizen event itself there is information about how to contact the author in the event that you decide to hire him to quot fill in all blanks quot in person the book is simply another info mercial where in this case you are paying for the advertisement	22
1	i have owned only 2 grills in my lifetime both were little cheap and unsuited to my novice grilling status when i committed to buy a real barbeque grill i read scores of reviews and descriptions to find the right one after reading amazon 's customer reviews of the performer \( the 827020 22 5 inch performer charcoal grill with propane gas ingnition purchased in summer of 2003 \) i was so impressed i bought it what a grill ! i do n't know how weber does it \( convection perhaps \? \) even my overdone meats come out moist and flavorful veggies come out great i grilled zucchini squash last summer and yumm ! this grill gives me the best of both worlds gas and charcoal the gas feature allows me to light up quickly rain or shine the small propane tank is not the primary energy source so seldom needs refilling charcoal gives foods real barbeque flavor and my gardens love weber 's convenient one step ash disposal system i cannot praise this grill enough i only wish the newer version inspired more positive reviews and hope friends i recommended the performer to can still find this model	22

1	i have owned this smoker for 5 years now and have a few insights for those looking to purchase this smoker i have smoked 7 turkeys alot of pork and some beef all with really great results i love that its electric regulating temp with charcoal smokers can be tedious you barely have to do anything to it except add water and chips it will maintain the ideal temperature of 220 degrees fairly well but there are a few issues with this smoker 1 materials and construction metal is thin and the lid fits loosely the lid is suppose to fit loosely ! there is no vent so it helps with the smoke but because the metal is thin on cold and or windy days it can be difficult for it to maintain it 's temp on long smokes often runs 200 210 degrees this will increase your cooking time ! on hot days it will run at 230 240 degrees although i ca n't reccomend this modification to help with heat loss i have actually heard of people fitting a electric water heating blanket to the outside of the smoker to help with this 2 i wish the heating element was adjustable to help regulate the temp 3 the door is small which makes it hard to add chips or water although you can take the unit off its base to add chips this is akward and a bit dangerous since you may spill the water it is nice to remove the base to help clean the unit though 4 i installed an after market temp gauge in the lid \( a must \) overall a good entry level smoker that is super easy to use got mine at w mart for 75 anyhow it 's a great value for under a 100 now after 5 years it is about done and i need a new smoker i will try to upgrade although after looking around at all the electric smokers i might just buy another one of these i love the bullet design of the vertical smokers the stainless steel version of this model looks nice and is obviously made of better material but the main section is attacted to the base i do like being able to remove the base plus the element is still not adjustable the only other choice is a stainless steel meco smoker which has a better door design and a adjustable heating element but is double the price so i will either get this model again and do some modifications \( temp gauge and maybe an adjustable element \) or get the meco hope this review helps	22
1	i love the taste of this hemp protein powder i love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the nutiva hemp seeds it tastes great and satisfies me on every level i also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands i could n't believe when i saw that there was 14 grams per serving considering that 90 of americans are lacking in fiber this protein powder can be a great service to millions	22

1	saw this product or maybe it was a similar one in a shop in cairns australia it was selling for about 70 australia dollars which is still quite expensive converted to us i came back to u s and found it on amazon for 15 99 with free ship if i purchased 30 so i bought two one for myself one for my husband ! it is wonderful ! we wear contacts for distance so it is such a convenience to always have it around our necks less the neckchains which always used to get tangled it 's an ingenius invention	22
1	i started playing this game in it 's original german version which went through some revision as the expansion decks were put out as a result the english version may end up being a little more together as you get the expansion decks talk about a wonderful game to play for two people ! it is absolutely well put together though certainly different in playing than the boardgame version of catan it uses the same notions but has a far more dynamic involvement within the game play itself the expansion packs are absolutely great and overall add lots of options and twists to the play of the game it takes a couple of hours and a signicant amount of table space it travels well enough in it 's box but to actually play it you need time and lots of space i highly recommend it especially if you are only two people and looking for a game that you can play that is fun involving and certainly full of strategy this is one of the many wonderful games made by klaus teuber and i hope he keeps coming up with winners	22

1	well i am very impressed with this i also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best if not the best i 've used i say that because whether i straighten my hair or leave it curly this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great it feels so nice and clean i do n't rinse twice with this because it 's unnessesary i tried this because of watching blow out and on my last trip to america i bought a couple of bottles it 's one of the best purchases i made most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you not only does it look and smell great but what it does for your hair is amazing and apparently it 's very low in damaging chemicals i wo n't hesitate to buy more of jonathan 's products next time i go i love this and ca n't say enough about it	22

1	i 've always preferred wordperfect to word i find it is easier to use more intuitive and allows more control over documents it is less buggy and i have yet to find one thing that word does better than wp this new version of wp is even better than the old and i can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from word word users should find this version especially easy to switch to since it can be made to look and act like word \( though why anyone would want that i do n't know \) underneath the surface though it is still wp which means it is stable you can see codes in your document and manipulate them and it wo n't do things like decide when you put a number somewhere that you are making a list and start indenting and doing other weird things you do n't want and ca n't control i have been using wpx3 heavily since i got it but i still have n't used all the features i am especially looking forward to trying its pdf conversion function i also have n't used any of the other programs in the suite yet but if prior versions are any indicator they will also be easy to use and powerful	22

0	my son was so excited for this toy it was all he asked for on his 8th birthday we went out to the lake this week and then began our frustration first there is no way to launch this 30 feet unless the wind gusts and the moon and planets are alligned then the safety bobber is so safe it does n't even open when it hits the water but does cause such a large ripple in the lake that all fish are gone for hours my son set it down after a hour of frustration and had me trek to the car to grab is old trusty fishing rod that is not as colorful and plastic but does actually cast and catch fish do n't get me wrong i think the rod is a gret idea but the people who designed it did a very slipshoddy job and i would warn anyone about spending money on it	22

1	here 's a secret for the uninformed this is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish this is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get and if you 're a regular ebay seller it 's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges with this scale and a plastic bag you can weigh any package no matter how irregularly shaped and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two but remember it 's a secret	22
0	it 's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up but what was worse was that after i owned it for two weeks the thing stopped working ! it was never dropped or damaged in anyway it just stopped the display just faded away and would n't work again even with a new battery this one was such a waste of money i 'll definately buy a different brand next time	22

1	previously i owned colorvision 's spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it it did not include however a program for correcting the printer 's color rendition the new spyder2pro includes printfix plus this along with the monitor correction spyder2pro works very effectively i am very happy with the program for the price it is a great addition to photoshop editing the spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera i have not found any particular negatives about the program in the past i have used their tech service for fine tuning the program they were very responsive and helpful	22
0	without my husband being handy this would have been in the trash on dec 26th took almost 2 hours to assembly with these small wooden pegs that barely held the unit together it fell apart when my daughter was playing with it on christmas day and so my husband improvised with stronger screws to hold it together though she loves playing with it we need to find out where we can purchase the furniture that the picture shows \? \?	22

1	supposed being victimized by local communist regime and soviet oppressors since august 1968 a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals no wonder sex is a fix for such a lucky and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with southern european rather than slavic appearance a little extended up to 165 minutes of screening romantic tale with some near porno inclusions is a bit more over positive and over entertaining than its final collapsed in well movie spirit seems being similar to a beautiful life producers or more recent one of levi 's hitler as a comedy hero of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only	22

0	we have used quickbooks on a pc since the 1990 's we loved the way inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting quickbooks for mac is terrible in comparison if you plan to use the payroll features it is unusable quickbooks mac payroll redirects you to the internet where it is handled by paycycle \( an independent company \) payroll is not integrated at all in the mac \( instead import export operation \) on the pc it is part of the quickbooks application we could not get job costing to work and the tax calculations made no sense we were paying tons of money to paycycle so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically we finally reverted back to quickbooks for windows and are much happier with intuit handling our payroll	22
1	if you have always wanted a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits then dominions ii is really the only option out there its not perferct but its darn good the story if you can really call it that is that the world of dominions once had one god one day he just was n't there all of a sudden and everybody and their brother decided to try and apply for his job all of these pretender gods have to kill off all the other gods and put their religions out of commision in order to take over the world and become a true god to start up a new game of dominions ii you need to choose from one of the 17 different empires and then pick your pretender god from dozens of different avatars you can play as darn near anything you can imagine from the ordinary like the arch mage to the outrageously exotic like the fountain of blood every pretender god has strengths and weaknesses and some may be adept at only one or two paths of magic while others may learn many with ease you also pick a castle and set up your own dominion which is the effect your god has on his followers as his religion spreads across the world but that is n't all you still have n't actually started a game yet next you have to create the game by picking from one of nearly a dozen huge maps and setting all of the game settings such as victory conditions and the difficulty of neutral provinces and lets not forget you also choose which of the 17 empires will be playing and if they will be human or ai players the game itself is huge and has very few limits your empires unique units may be built in any province in which you have built a castle but every proince in the game also has its own units that may be built there to inculde many that none of the empires usually have access to plus units may be equiped with different armor and weapons and as such there may well be hundreds of unique units in the game with maybe even thousands of different equipment varaitions like the pretender gods units come in a huge array from simple like the light infantry to the wild like werewoles and vampires combine that with the fact that there are hundreds of spells in the game to research hundreds of magic items to forge and find and random events almost every turn no two games will ever end the same way and the game has nearly unlimited replyability combat is a bit unsual all units in order to move around the map or attack have to be assigned to a commander commanders are built in the same way you recruit normal units but they can only lead so many men however you can assign units under a commander to as many squads as you like and each squad as well as the commander himself can be issued a specific order such as casting spells using ranged weapons or attacking certain foes on the battle field the downside of all this is that you have to set up all of this before hand during your turn combat occours in between turns and you have no control over the battle its entirely up to your units to follow the plan you laid out for them for better or worse this system is certainly original but some things about the game really bother me my biggest complaint with the game has to be the computer ai its not thats its too stupid or too smart its actually a bit like the terminator it allways seems to know where you are and sends wave after wave of seemingly endless foes after you it ca n't be reasoned with it ca n't be bargined with and it wo n't stop until one of you is dead with no diplomacy options and units like spys assassins and scouts being extremely rare and expensive most games aginst the ai just deteroiate into massive rushing attacks with huge armies killing each other over and over with gods throwing spells at each other turn after turn another problem with the game is the manual which is huge but contains no information that is n't easily available in the game its the same problem evil genius had the manual is awful and all the hints that should hae been in the manual are hidden in the games loading screens i hope you can read fast the grapics obviously are n't exactly on par with half life 2 or doom 3 but they work however i 've got to take issue with the music and sound which is downright awful you better get used to hearing the same three music tracks over and over over all dominions ii is by far the best turn based fantasy game i 've ever played room for improvement is obviously here but this game should keep you occupied for a long time	22
0	i recently bought this thinking i could use it to upgrade my ti 86 calculator to my surprise i heard it was incompatible with xp i supposed the worst that could happen is that it would n't work as soon as i recieved the cable it said to go to the website so i went and updated the software specific to my calculator after the installation it asked me to restart after the restart i immediatly recieved a blue screen of death and luckily windows xp found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that i would have to do a format i have not fully installed it yet as now i have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not 100 xp compatible and may mess up your system	22
1	i bought these for my zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding compact headphone for work and working out at the gym if you are like me and ca n't stand all the earbuds out there then you need to find another solution i tried the premium zune buds at 40 bucks and the bose quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks but they just gave me earaches and i was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight i read countless reviews of this headphone and i can say this is the best sounding under 40 headphone out there that wo n't mess with your hair \( yes better than even the bose earbuds ! \) if you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player be prepared to be blown away tight full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids you do n't have to crank them either they sound rich even at lower volumes but if you do crank them they do n't distort at all if you have ever tried the bose quiet comforts at the stores these sound very similar but with an open air design ! the only negative is the comfort the little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so i think i 'll get used to it i 'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal \( which i had \) that could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems some other reviewers complained about the headband but it sounds like they were not wearing these right once on your noggin the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head this keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort i do not think the headband is too tight it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place i might buy a pair of the px 100 's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading the px 100 is the same exact phone in an over the head design at 40 i can afford to get both	22

1	cagney 's startling performance as tommy powers in william wellman 's public enemy was to be expected he was powerful when needed gentle with his short jabs of affection and his fast talking wit whether in anger or in good spirits was in amazing contrast to his relatively slower talking co stars or was it to be expected in 1931 \? i did n't know until watching the commentaries around this film that co star edward woods was supposed to be the lead and that cagney was to play matt at the last minute in movie minutes the roles were switched and yet both actors were beyond comfortable with their new parts \( edward woods was incredibly underrated does anybody know why he quit making movies in 1938 \? he lived for decades after that \) i wo n't rehash the plot here but i must pay homage to every cast member jean harlowe what more can be said \? leslie fenton as nails nathan was a study in polished brutality joan blondell as mamie was cute as a button with her wide eyed perkiness and sincere affection for her matt donald cook could not have been better cast as the brooding righteous older brother to tom \( at points he 's tougher than cagney 's tommy \) beryl mercer as ma gets away with being so sweet without being saccharine british actor murray kinell is just slimy enough to deserve his end as the fagin like putty nose and last but definitely not least is robert o'connor as the paternal crime boss paddy ryan who is sincere in his care for his young apprentices the uncredited child actors who played the young tommy and matt were priceless now can anyone tell me who tony the waiter was i loved his only line pop ! bur r p ! pa pop ! as for the dvd itself well the sound was sometimes muddy and the changes in film quality where they restored previously edited material are jarring but so what \? you can see and hear every word in this masterpiece better than films made ten years ago that were sloppily transferred to digital and the warner night at the movies \( 1931 \) was a brilliantly executed way to let us experience what it must have been like to go to the movies 75 years ago this is a must have disc for lovers of gangster movies or the classics	22

0	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	22
1	absolutely love this program i 'd been using norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch its not as user friendly as norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted on the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity making it an exceptionally good security program	22
1	im not a professional keyboard player i bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and guitar pro it suits those needs great its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing the keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard if your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the 100 bucks and get the bigger model	22

1	i 've never seen a movie with a more accurate depiction of life in the ussr from late 40s to early 50s what people had to live with psychologically far outweighed anything physical for the average person buy this film to understand	22
0	please promise me you will never play this it is not worth your time if you paid money for it try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin hard then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster seriously though this game is absolutely terrible the graphics are bad even for the psx the combat quickly becomes boring as all hell the story line was confused and the fact that there was a second dimension pointless there was no reason for there being 40 something characters most of them were exactly the same statwise and all of them were poorly designed the most annoying thing in the world bar nothing is having to re equip all your character 's spells whenever you switch characters you have like 50 spell slots god i do n't think i even need to say it but those crumbums at square could n't pull another hit out of their oversized victorian tophats if they wanted too they should really stick with straight to video final fantasy 7 anime movies from now on lest they risk making something like this again	22

1	i purchased the smallest version the lw 14 for the purpose of cleaning the air in a small kitchen without windows air ionizers did n't rid the air of the frying smells but this appliance works the initial price is high but not the cost to keep the venta running water is cheap power consumption on highest setting is about 35 watt for whisper quiet use in a bedroom a lower setting is better any air con would be much louder anyways and drown out the venta on the highest setting the motor used to power the machine is indeed very silent and possible ca n't be manufactured for 30 the other components are ruggedly constructed and hopefully last many years the device can also be used for aromatherapy which i'm just testing with some natural mint oil against my cold	22

1	i know i'm a little late but what the heck \? i felt like writing a review for this game final fantasy x is just a fantastic game simple as that its extremely deep has a fantastic story great characters great battle system and it 's the perfect length for a rpg \( 45 55 hours \) not everyone likes tidus be he honestly does n't bother me and i think he is a interesting character the rest of the cast is well developed and they all have interesting personalities that are distinct to this universe the cast is very memorable you 'll remember them for years to come and i think that speaks volumes as to how good this game is its enhanced by the usual good voice acting that square is known for so that does n't disapoint the gameplay is extremely fun and its actually one of my favorite battle systems the battle system can make or break a rpg and this one does n't disappoint its fast paced so it does n't get bogged down by long battles you can also swap characters mid battle thats a awesome feature the gameplay is also incredibly deep i 've heard of people literally pouring hundreds of hours into this game so if thats your thing i'm sure you 've probably already played this game if for some reason you have not played this game and your into rpg 's do n't hesitate to pick this game up its cheap now and its one of the best and most balanced rpg 's i 've ever played	22

1	the wsj has always been required reading for business people and finance wonks but in the past several years the whole thing reporting layout editorials has been overhauled and the result is one of the best general newspapers in america first of all business economics finance etc are extremely important to everyone whether their profession involves these things or not everyone 's lives are shaped by these things and it is important to understand them second of all a thoughtful couterpoint to the liberal media has long been lacking and the wsj editorials fill the need read both the wsj and the new york times every day and you will likley hear two thoughtful but opposing sides of all the major issues confronting our nation and world from which you can begin to develop your own independent view i cannot recommend strongly enough that everyone subscribe to and read the wsj every \( week \) day	22

0	the reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna be 's of true cultural wits like mencken and updike some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable i 'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag and save your money to buy books that nourish you	22

1	this book covers in depth the lbo of rjr nabisco in the late 1980s recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew i wanted to go into m a work i decided to read it i thought the book was excellent but maybe unnecessarily long the authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation the two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless for someone interested in pursuing a top wall street job this book is a must for everyone else that just likes good non fiction this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era	22

1	first off those of you calling it a clip should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself please call it a magazine \( actual name for it \) and a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30 06 round second dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar it 's plastic it shoots things i'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance so yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you not a sport i also suggest getting 20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water have fun p s though they may noth have the trigger finger ability spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb 's if you are playin with friends i suggest getting a 30 dollar rifle with 250 300 fps \( shoots like 300 350	22

0	the panasonic is very compact very stylish sexy as my wife called it but the photos are very disappointing they are way to noisy ! even if set on the lowest asa setting at 80asa it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100asa the colours are good and it does take very good videos but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in photoshop cs2 of course it is easy to understand why the native resolution of the images if one investigates such things will notice that the panasonic is only 72 dpi same as sony 's canon improves this to 180 and nikon is at 300 dpi it is not just about megapixels folks but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi so before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model do yourself a favour try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition set the camera for the lowest asa and the highest picture quality in jpg format take the photos pop the sd card into the computer compare the images in photoshop enlarge to full pixel size \( 100 \) and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself that is what i did since i was not very happy with the images my panasonic produced ! i had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly and today i traded it in on a nikon p5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the leica d lux3 10mp camera and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store but it was very educational for them too	22

0	while i think the basics of the book are good i do n't like how fat free items are treated as always being the best option i did much better on the south beach diet where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods fat is what makes us feel satisfied after years of trying to diet by limiting fat it was a revelation to me i could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived an omelette made of egg whites and fat free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary secondly many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low fat i just noticed this week that cool whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it 's top ingredients this ca n't be better for you than actual cream i also prefer the book french woman do n't get fat which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good natural food when it 's in season the pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle i feel that the g i diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before i think this book is about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated it certainly can help get people on the right track but i think there are better books available	22

0	the population of hong kong is approximately 7 million people i 'd say that about half of them get shot in this movie usually when a movie runs over 2 hours it 's because there 's a lot of plot that the director wanted to squeeze in in the case of hard boiled the running time of 126 minutes was clearly necessitated by john woo 's desire to get into the guinness book of records for most people killed by gunfire in a single motion picture chow yun fat is a charismatic actor who can bring a wonderful balletic grace to gunplay and this movie gives him plenty of opportunity to show his stuff he shoots \( usually with a pistol in each hand \) while diving headlong over furniture while swinging from a rope while sliding down a banister \( ! \) while being hurled through the air by explosions sometimes he even shoots while standing still and he shoots and shoots and shoots and the bad guys shoot and shoot and shoot and yun fat 's fellow cops shoot and shoot and you get the idea there are some fine action scenes in this film but my eyes were glazing over long before it ended there was n't enough to distinguish one scene of a bunch of people being machine gunned from the next and it became painfully repetitious personally i would highly recommend the replacement killers over hard boiled there 's plenty of yun fat 's balletic shoot em up action but not so much that you find yourself in the odd position of being lulled to sleep by gunfire	22
1	ever notice how hard it is to find a watch that really fits the arm of your 6 year old \? not any more this not only gave my kids a watch that actually fits it was fun for them to assemble them and they are still mixing up the colors of the bands you can simply add or subtract links to get the perfect fit the different links provided means if it breaks there 's plenty of spares there 's no spare clasp pieces so if they break the clasp they 're done but the clasps are quite sturdy the kids have broken a couple of links without breaking the clasps already they have learned to be aware of the watch on their wrist so they have n't broken any more links since the first few days \( and there 's twice as many links as what we need \) overall this was a great product that my kids enjoy	22

1	charles laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly played role as england 's king henry the eigth who infamously married six different queens divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted the script to this magnificent alexander korda production is a witty jab at english history buffs touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of ann boleyn concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty capacious king laughton as ever is a marvel skillfully presenting henry at first as a thinly cariacatured lout and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point this is all about the cleverly rendered script which turns british schoolboy lessons on their heads and on the classy ensemble acting which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print \( i'm writing in the year 2003 perhaps criterion or some other class act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon \) still fans of early british cinema will enjoy this film a lot	22

1	i purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that i expected it did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time i wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall i am very happy with my gym and i use it all the time only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way i look	22
1	even without the great looking box this product is well worth the money but with the box it is almost a work of art \( of course some stain in the bare wood would help \) this cleaning kit is a must for any collector of japanese weapons	22
0	i bought these today so that i could review an mp3 presentation as soon as i put the headphone on i wanted to take them back ! it has the most annoying buzzing sound what philips means what they say noise canceling is that the buzzing sound will drown out all background noise ! well i'm taking these back	22
0	i had high hopes for this book there are too many parts that feel self serving and pointless i felt like i was reading the author 's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation the material on ideo could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader i found the preface by one of the author 's former professors to be the best part of the book i would not recommend buying this book	22
1	reasonably priced used it once so far to jump start worked perfectly very well built feels sturdy \( the led charge indicator is useful \)	22

1	like an apricot but better in my opinion the downy fuzz the sweet juicy flesh there really is nothing like a good peach i think they are best on their own though some like to cut them up in a fruit salad or make a peach melba that is fine but i would strongly advise against cooking them in my opinion this is a waste of a good peach a friend of mine swears by his baked peaches with demerera sugar and cinnamon but he is a savage and a charlatan to conclude peaches are without doubt one of the finest fruits around there are few things as satisfying as a sweet ripe peach on a sunny day	22
0	i read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives a lively debate there were so many brilliant things said about the film that i found myself passing out helpful votes \( to both positive blisteringly negative reviews \) like they were candy the movie is an evocative work of art i encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view i agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers but i will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned the dvd cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers a sort of blue lagoon from the renaissance it is not it is misleading i concede a \) the story is probably not historically accurate b \) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition c \) tossi was probably inconsiderate conceited and immoral but the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters having said that i do object that the movie according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available is not just inaccurate but oppositional to what probably occurred therefore i critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person the movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional \( or incorrect \) causal factors and those cause effect relationships do n't seem to ring true having said that i agree with some of richard burt 's review comments that historical accuracy may still be subject to interpretation it is reasonable that artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial \( defending her freedom and reputation \) than she might have been with tassi personally and it seems too easy to just paint tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done there is usually more complexity and diverse conflicting interests in most people especially artists one strong objection near the end of the film artemisia says no one dies of sorrow while there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment the line frustrated me people do die of sorrow my limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest most sensitive artistic and caring people i 've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow and the people i have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow not selfish controlling or passive aggressive sorrow but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations often unidentified misunderstood misconceptions sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit character the soul creativity sorrow is not incidental sorrow can destroy health or as the angel of america in angels in america says the body is the garden of the soul sorrow is worth full attention the movie tries to examine the effect of artemisia 's loyalties to her father and her teacher the screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply good or bad both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on artemesia her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression they work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts at the same time they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices privacy and pacing beyond her desired level of influence artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father 's drive and design at the same time she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in in polite society may your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find and may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties compare caravaggio 's judith beheading holofernes to artemisia 's version of the same painting her version is more violent realistic \( less idealized in posing dirtiness lighting etc \) her version has the female servant actively helping judith artemisia 's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate violence sexuality compassion artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best that 's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions	22

0	to me this game was seriously disappointing so disappointing i did n't finish the second case before setting it down forever i was highly entertained at first it 's cute funny and going around clicking on things for a new ds user was highly entertaining however it quickly got older 1 you ca n't skip through the horrendously long dialog ever even after you 've heard it about a million times because you 're clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do 2 i found myself looking for an internet walk through yes on this simplistic game i could n't figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you 've read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level 3 possible spolier there seemed to be a glich in the second story in which i talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then i could never get a ticket into the planetarium after that i just could n't take it any more and gave up 4 the places and people never change for each case from my understanding it 's all the exact same tiny few places i'm not a big gamer but i like a world bigger than three feet i let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me just to help this review i'm a college age female and this is my first gaming console although i 've played the ps2 quite a bit maybe it 's really a hit or miss but i do n't really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level a really high patience level	22

0	save your 3 50 dvd rental fee if you 're looking for a movie that will make you feel like city of angels made you feel look elsewhere ! sorry my vote is for hollywood the director of wings admits that there was no script before shooting began the extras that came with the wings dvd interviews and info on berlin were more entertaining than the movie	22
0	claiming that this fan 's 3 speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling is very misleading on low the fan barely moves any air on high it still does n't move much air and is incredibly quiet nearing silent in my opinion if you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads this is not the fan for you the 3 speed switch is useless as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high	22

0	went to see this movie at the imax in san antonio this weekend i have to say i actually laughed most of the way through the effects were decent but most of the time i had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3d effects that was when i was n't having to look around the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie some of the torture scenes and the faustian plotline along with the hideous firey face that is mr d make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of 10 but the terrible plot along with the worst voice acting i have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of 10 basically i guess you could say i was slightly displeased with the movie i do have to admit that i got a hearty laugh when the main character johnny \( played by jasper steverlinck an up and coming rocker and lead singer of the band arid a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot i could find in the movie \) throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil mr d and destroy the haunted castle unfortunately the scene was designed to be serious	22
0	i chose these earrings because of the yellow and white gold combo they felt quite flimsy when i got them i do like a lightweight earring but not a flimsy one the studs on these are not attached as firmly as i would like one has already come off they are however very pretty the quality was just not what i expected	22
1	we like this stroller it seems to be pretty durable and its weight and portability \( shoulder strap \) make it ideal for trips especially in airports my husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall \( 6'4 \) but it is fine for me \( 5'3 \) we like it for our 5 month old son because he is able to recline but still sit up enough to watch what 's going on he can hold his head up well but is n't sitting up unsupported yet so the various levels of the reclining back are nice overall a good stroller for the price	22
1	i had these on my wish list and decided to order them for myself after christmas after looking in stores and not finding anything that looked quite the same ! they just arrived and all i can say is wow ! nice look substantial size and plenty of statement picture does not do them justice all i can say is do n't hesitate you will be dissappointed if they sell out	22
0	i received this subscription as a trial and found it one of the most boring publications that i have ever read by the last few issues that i got i was n't even looking at the pictures anymore there are drawn out descriptions of their views of the finer things in life which were very materialistic at the end of every issue there were pictures of quot real life quot wedding announcements perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper but it struck me as out of place in a magazine	22
1	for the price this is a very nice fire pit it looks good and works fine i did find the instructions a bit more complicated than they needed to be but it was not hard to put together	22
1	the wagon is great as expected 5 stars for the wagon no stars for delivery it arrived with a dent though and when we called they told us a replacement would n't be available until mid february plus we 'd have to figure out how to re pack the thing which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent so we gently banged it out and spray painted the spot and the recipients probably wo n't care but it was a pain in the butt and there did n't seem any way to deal with it that would n't have been too much trouble	22
0	i did not pay head to the other reveiws and bought this bike anyway the first day i had it the back fender snapped off leaving sharp points exposed sadly we had to tell our 4 year old on his birthday that he could not ride the bike so we returned it and got another one not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one than the exhaust pipes came off leaving a very sharp screw exposed then the tire came off and the rim broke becuase it was plastic as well also the vinyl on the seat started to come apart at this point i had to return it and fight to get my money back ! ! it was a week after it had been delivered to the house i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike !	22
1	this game is very fun and has lots of action that is for sure many people may find this good enough for the game to satisfy them but i am not one of them the mythology part is good and the creatures and gods are described and portrayed very well but the plot to the campaign messes it all up the last campaign was much larger and it was more fun i was disappointed in the new campaign i 'd say the first one is better if you make a big deal about graphics though than this game is for you it has excellent graphics and features the ocean and mountain looks so realistic they do a good job showing you underwater these graphics blow away the graphics of the age of empires series if you were expecting a good campaign your not going to be very happy plot isnt so good and its very short it has about half of the other games campaigns a big difference is that in normal games the titans always come out they 're kind of annoying overall this game is good but not as good as the prequal graphics 10 10campaign plot 3 10music 6 10mythology 9 10overall 7 10	22
1	i bought this for my father in law who had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old my mother in law at sixty seven does n't have a lot of arm and shoulder strength and cannot wield a full size wheelchair around and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota camry the light weight of this chair works great for short trips to appointments i would n't recommend it for a long day shopping at the mall however it 's not as easy to use as a full size standard wheelchair this is a great chair for shorter trips and appointments to make transferring easier to manage	22

0	i pre ordered this right after i saw it on i want that tech toys and it finally arrived just after christmas after nearly five months of waiting the first few days had serious set up issues where the water would n't drain my cats were interested in watching it but since the water would n't go out they were not interested in using it for its intended purpose i had it sitting next to their litter maid and they would n't use the new box their excessive use overwhelmed and burned out the littermaid motor so it had to be thrown out now with just the cat genie i hoped they would adapt they did not they pee on the floor poop on the floor finally one of the four was willing to use the new box then it stopped draining and even that one cat would't go near it because it was full of water i am at my wits end plugging and unplugging trying to reset it i have made two attempts to contact the parent company who makes these with no return calls or emails i am very tech saavy we have lots of robots around here roombas scoobas spotbots and others so this cat genie was ideal but i guess it is n't ready yet	22
0	i bought this apple humidifier in early november it stopped working soon at the first time i used it i later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again you have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working i contacted the manufacturer and got replacement however the new one has the same problem and what 's worse it leaks ! ! i talked to the manufacturer again but they did n't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else now i have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do	22
1	i bought this rangefinder for golf it is small enough that i could keep it in my pocket it really helps me with the approach shots to the greens it takes a bit of experience to be able to focus on the flag i usually use a person on the green as my target after i got an approximate read i use the scan mode to find the exact distance to the flag be careful with the tiny battery cover it came loose and i lost it on the golf course fortunately i recovered it amongst the green grass the cover is also green i now put a tape over it to secure the cover	22

0	the first half of this movie starts out promising the 2nd half is not so good it becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical whereas it started out charming and promising of particular annoyance is the ending where we find the hackneyed politically correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple 's separation and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he indeed the wife 's character is strikingly uneven in this movie her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half quite inconsistent	22
0	i 've owned this camera a little over a year it was my 2nd digital camera it always had focus issues in low light i thought it was me but after working extensively with the manual after i finally had some time i discovered that it was the camera you really need a tripod for those low light shots i was n't able to return it so i 've taken hundreds of pictures with it it takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen however the lens will no longer contract and i get an error message that is unresolvable unless i pay at least 170 i'm just going to get a better quality camera i will not buy sony again	22
1	i bought this dryer based on other people 's review it is an excellent dryer the air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did i did n't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers however since it dries my hair fast my arms do n't mind the weight \) 2 thumbs up in my book ! !	22

1	if you 're looking for a high quality telephoto zoom lens that is fast enough to use indoors you may have found what you 're looking for the 70 200 2 8 lens produces beautiful results that are overall on par with the 135 2 prime lens \( although not quite as sharp \) the main downside to this lens is that it 's big and heavy i do n't mind carrying it around my neck on the camera so much but when you go to use if you have to put extra effort into keeping the lens from shaking in your hands due to the weight and it 's not exactly the sort of lens that i would want to toss into my backpack just due to the immense size if you do n't mind spending an extra 500 consider also the 70 200 2 8 is \( image stabilization \) version of this lens it weighs even more but the built in is unit should help compensate for shaky hands whilst using the lens	22
1	in anthoney bourdain 's book kitchen confidential he talks about how in a real kitchen the chefs do n't use henkle or wustoff knives they use global cat cora of american iron chef also uses global knives i needed a good knife in my kitchen so i decided to check out global as well first of all it 's incredibly light if i'm chopping a lot of onions for a french onion soup or making a big batch of mirepoix for some beef stock i notice that lightness then there 's the balance see that notch where the blade meets the handle \? pick the knife up by that notch and it balanced exactly level try that with a standard knife and you 'll see how handle heavy they are finaly the edge these knives are insanely sharp they cut like a dream i just went to a knife sharpening clinic by wustoff and they suggest honeing your knife with 5 or 6 stroks on a steel before every meal that you cook i 've found that this keeps the edge razor sharp however you should realize that the edge on these knives is at 15 degrees not 20 degrees so adjust the angle you use to hone the edge overall it 's an amazing knife take care of it and it will serve you as a professional quality tool for a long time	22

1	lindt lindor truffles are very smooth quite rich and very sweet they tend to melt in your mouth \( and in your hands so get shoveling \) for me they 're a bit too sweet as i prefer the taste of leonidas or cote d'or chocolates as they have a bit more bite to them they are also much harder to find and more expensive soooooo if you want good rich chocolate and you like your chocolate sweet lindt lindor truffles is a good place to look	22
0	all of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs ing you those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans that game was barely mediocre at best other ff7 releases advent children cell phone game and movie tv show thing all three things resectively sucked now comes dierge of cerberus whoop did eeee doo ! ! the only reason why i rented it was because the title says final fantasy in it the only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes other than that boring if you can get more than 20 minutes through the game then by all means it 's the game for you	22

1	the touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice the onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen \( easier sad than done \) if anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer	22

1	perhaps the long shadow of francis parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the french and indian war \( seven year 's war \) whatever the reason it 's good to see from the publication of several books that americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre revolutionary period when the british were triumphant and the indians still counted as a political force it 's past time for a thorough revision of parkman who was ungenerous with the indians although i thrilled as a young reader to his descriptions of their ferocity for example the insensate fury of the iroquois actually the iroquois were less insensate than they were astute calloway omits the bloody details and vivid writing of parkman but he gives us a thorough picture of what happened in the wake of the english victory over the french in north america in particular he focuses on the frontier and the built in conflict of american settlers british policy and the indian tribes who either went down to defeat with the french or were betrayed by perfidious albion they made their point however in pontiac 's war and by clearing white settlers from the frontier but their numbers were declining and they would soon be overwhelmed this is a good book about the issues of the frontier between whites and indians in addition there 's a good account of the french movement from canada to louisiana and the spanish rule in florida and the trans mississippi smallchief	22
1	which is ok i think if they made this game fully controlled by the stylus and touchpad it would make it a bit wacky sort of like mario 64 ds and like mario kart you have the 2nd screen as your map but you can also use it to use items whenever you like and also jump from area to area whenever you want that 's really the jist of this game when it comes to new features someone wrote loosely based off the old 2d side scroller marios but actually this is very much based off them entirely the only difference is that the environments and characters are in full 3d yet still side scrolling view which is a nice touch watching the 3d models move around like that other then that it 's a nice update to the old classics especially big mario which you never do get much to play with thanks to the use of a giant mushroom and vice versa a mini mushroom that causes mario to shrink \( and the only way to access the other levels by defeating the enemy bosses as mini mario \) there 's also a new shell costume of which mario dons but can quickly get out of control if you run to fast and he spins all over all in all it 's a very fun game entertaining but not very hard which is good for the young folks but those reminiscent of the old days know how hard it was to beat a mario game back then and this was surprisingly easy luckily the game is packed with mulitplayer features and mini games to add to the value and they do not all are entirely fun but the majority do make use of the touchpad and make up for not using it much throughout the game playing 2 player will always be fun of course unfortunately it 's not wifi so you have to be within range of someone else with the game	22

0	not too long after i purchased this camera the screen turned white when i turned it on i would turn it off and on and nothing would help finally i would take the batteries out and put them back in this seemed to fix the problem a few times after that i thought it was just operator error but it was n't the camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away so after being annoyed i left the camera alone for awhile an event came up about a month later i got my camera and tried to turn it on nothing happened so i changed the batteries still nothing happened i'm not sure what happened i do believe i purchased a lemon camera i'm hoping to resolve these issues with samsung it was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time so i guess you get what you pay for !	22
0	at 300mm this lens is very soft it 's hard to get a shot that looks like it 's in focus to do so you need to shoot at about f 11 and then since there is little light available you usually have to bump the iso to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed of course the high iso then introduces other artifacts the focus is also dead slow and often does n't lock on this is a lens that i have constantly fought with do n't upgrade to the new 70 300 is either as it 's only marginally better buy the 70 200 f 4l it 's a far superior lens	22
1	i do n't often watch foreign films the reason being as an american i do n't feel that i can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works french spanish german etc regardless of nationality genre or time period they generally leave me cold with that in mind i went into this with no doubts as to the film 's greatness but again did n't think as an american i would be able to see it as the situational nuances would be lost on me as it turned out i was wrong and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily and did n't seem obtuse or foreign the experience could best be likened to watching the graduate as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching i wo n't recap the storyline or discuss details of the movie itself i just wanted to say that i went into this skeptical expecting to find a picture that i could n't relate to but what i found was an immediate compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition	22

0	this mirror really is n't worth the money you 'd be better off just buying a plain mirror for baby to look in and for you to look at baby that 's about all this thing does the remote control has to be pointed directly at the mirror kinda hard to do driving down the road also the music is n't very loud atleast not loud enough to get baby 's attention when upset which is what i was hoping for and the lights are n't very bright really ca n't see that they even light up unless it 's very dark out also the positioner works fairly well when baby is facing backwards but once you turn baby around and have to attach the mirror to the back of the front seat it does n't stay in place that well you could spend alot less money for just a plain baby in sight mirror	22
0	i purchased this item for my son 's birthday not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly after a couple of days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min successful flight on the second day after 15 mins of recharging the battery the battery case and wires melted have contacted company for a refund	22
0	here 's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set \( i e k 3rd \) every science kit including this one basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and voila ! you made a volcano nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of mt st helen 's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors \? you guessed it food dye all these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards back in the middle ages people who sold this kind of hokum for the price it now commands were called alchemists they eventually went out of business buy the kid a suzukie violin or a football helmet instead	22

1	i purchased the bike carrier for my cargo carrier it arrived without the bolts \( i 'll tell you about this later \) you have to alternate bikes front tire back tire front tire to get all three on it 's really easy to attach and works great you will have to purchase straps to secure the bikes to the carrier the carrier is great but lund international is not now about the missing bolts the first time i called lund international the service rep was very friendly took my address and phone number and said he would send the missing bolts right away i called about a month later and the friendly service rep appoligized and said he would send them i decided to purchase the bolts from the local hardware store instead i wonder what their warrenty is like if they wo n't replace missing bolts i hope this is n't standard business for the lund company	22
0	i bought a 743 for the wife for christmas i had a 6330 that i was very happy with so a 743 should be better right \? every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead we finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on ! after several e mails they told me to call service i got someone in india that could not understand me and i had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying they made it very dificult to get it sent in i sent it in today but i do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far i hope it comes back at least	22

0	as a musician who 's dealt w opening many cd packages for many years let me save you some money you do n't need a special tool to open cds just run the bottom edge of the cd against any solid rough surface \( like a sidewalk or concrete wall \) a couple of times the plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie allowing you to take it off effortlessly getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the cd off is easy too again no tools required you 'll notice that the cd cover is hinged at the top bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back it just pops in out held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top bottom then bend the whole thing back toward the top of the cd case where the sticker is affixed so that the sticker becomes straightened out this will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece \( try peeling the front cover off the sticker rather than vice versa \) and you 're done ! all you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy the whole process takes under a minute and you 'll still have the money in your pocket that you did n't spend on an iffy cd opening tool to buy another cd with	22

1	i bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the hungry girl website and i am glad that i did they work well in a number of different recipes are filling and add a calcium boost to the dishes i use them in for very few calories these are not pasta type noodles of course the texture is different \( softer and kind of slippery \) and they have virtually no flavor of their own they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them i probably wo n't use these noodles with european style or american style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce those types of sauces were created for grain based pastas which these are not on the other hand these noodles are fine in such asian recipes as pad thai lo mein and dan dan noodes \( basically noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce \) there are a lot of asian style recipes in cookbooks and on the internet which are fairly easy to make taste terrific and work beautifully with these noodles you can prepare yourself a real treat if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture and for a fraction of the calories you 'd eat if using regular noodles or rice in short if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles you 're likely to be disappointed but if you use them in pad thai any type of curry other asian dishes or most soups you 're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low cal low carb meal one thing when you open the bag there is a slight ammonia like odor \( it smells ammonia like to me anyway \) if you rinse the noodles well and then parboil them for a few minutes as per the package directions the odor really does disappear it is not a strong odor it wo n't permeate your kitchen or anything like that but you will definitely want to rinse and parboil the noodles before using them just follow the package directions	22

1	i just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday i was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me i was surprised because i had n't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air when i realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry like seventh generation 's lavender laundry detergent i love this product if you use them in tandem not only do your clothes smell like real lavender \( not the chemically based smells of mainstream products \) but they come out clean and soft i especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it 's gentle enough to use on my baby 's clothes too ! i love that it 's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil it 's also safe for my septic system so i'm sold on this product if you 're sensitive to the chemical based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or ca n't find one that smells good to you try this one !	22

0	got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it is n't all that easy to get on and off with 8 snap on straps it 's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on off on a regular basis i realized changing the crib sheet was just easier with crib mattresses being vinyl covered why do we need waterproof sheets anyway i just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl so simple sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products by the way two of the straps broke off in the wash thank god it was after i realized i did n't need this anyway	22
0	i was going to buy this camera for my teenage daughter today but after reading the reviews i decided that it is not a god risk if the customer service is that bad and the screen seems to break without any kind of impact i'm sure it takes nice pictures but a lot of cameras take nice pictures i have to go where the service will at least respect you	22

0	i gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf this pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it it has problems that need modification the top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb that means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it add some adhesive velchro to the back of the case make a fabric band for your ankle attach the ends to each other with velchro put a strip of velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band i get accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle i got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline the hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted i opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring the strut is made of thin brass aluminum from a soda can would work too i made a v in one end of the strut to hold the spring i pushed lightly against the spring from the left side drilled a hole in the brass and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board the strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it i now have quite a few miles on the pedometer \( i have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely \) several times the pedometer reset itself to 0 for no apparent reason i know nothing pushed on the reset button one incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security once it reset while i was walking twice it reset while i was napping on the sofa i am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit but i do not know static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers too this pedometer uses a counter circuit if someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts connect a button switch to the two wires freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue	22

0	i thought this would be a good product for my computer i did n't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download during the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove \( uninstall delete \) all of your known antivirus spyware and firewalls from your computer prior to install this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message i received an error message that prevented me from completing the download i purchased the software on aug 3 and called customer support they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue they were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support those that know the basics and those that know more they asked me to set up a time span when i would like to receive a call from the teir ii agents i chose 6 9pm i received several calls over the next two weeks all of them were outside of the specified time i missed several of them because i have a career and a life when i finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue here it was two weeks after i purchased the software i still did not have what i needed i was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software i called in several times druing the ordeal and the teir i agents just told me that i have to wait for the call they 'll get to it when they get to it i was very upset with the customer support i have no idea how the product is but the customer support is just horrible go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the post your own thoughts page through member accounts you 'll see that i'm not alone in this issue i have since purchased other software that cover what microsoft says it will with onecare i did not have one problem with these installs please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system \( seperate from onecare \) this costs an additional 35 ontop of the cost for onecare	22
0	i love the idea behind this game and it 's pretty impressively exectuted i had three gripes though 1 \) it 's so fast paced that i found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 \) i could n't get the magnify and reduce \( with quick little circles \) to work this caused me great frustration 3 \) there 's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times i quit playing it pretty quickly	22
0	this fountain is a piece of junk i ordered three of them and all three had cracks and holes in the top piece the top piece is a molded resin that is very thin in places the thin regions easily crack making it unsightly interfering with the performance and within days rendering the fountain unusable i was very disappointed and ended up buying an entirely different fountain	22

0	the author makes a couple of valuable points first any long term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent secular \( i e indefinitely long \) bear markets most leading investment advisors recommend a buy and hold strategy but this only works during predominately bull market periods most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982 1999 bull market which is anomalous in historical terms the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that buy and hold does n't always provide the best returns obviously then it 's better to pull out during the bear markets but that 's easier said than done the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets including p e ratio interest and inflation rates and gdp the problem is that those characteristics do n't always correlate with market performance for example this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market well if you heeded his advice you would have missed the bull market of 2004 2005 and early 2006 especially in small mid caps and foreign stocks even with high p e ratios a bull market can continue for several years witness the late 90s it 's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis there is so much volatility on a daily weekly monthly and yearly basis that 's it 's impossible to know when the market has switched directions by the time that it is apparent it 's too late to profit even in the midst of great bull markets there might be week month or even year long downturns the author says nothing about individual stock picking beyond a general value approach the book is all about big picture long term trends another problem is that the author 's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900 but the market \( and economy \) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s 50s 60s and 70s as they say past performance does not predict future returns the investment advice provided here is not useful he suggests a portfolio of hedge funds ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k he also recommends a bond ladder an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations i do n't need to spend 25 and five hours reading to learn that ! one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for most studies just average the returns across years but that does n't reflect real returns let 's say you invest 100k into a stock that returns 35 the first year and 15 the second your average return should be 10 a year right \? wrong at the end of the first year you have 135k minus 15 the second year leaves you with 115k total equal to 7 a year compounded if you had received 10 a year compounded your final total would be over 121k that 's 6k difference in just 2 years and the volatility costs add up the book is very poorly written plodding sooooo boring with tons of repetition just as an example the graph showing the y curve relationship between p e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times	22
0	this item was recommended in a magazine article for calluses on your feet so i bought this specifically for that use i used the triangular pumice attachment only i was under the impression that the attachment would rotate but in general it 's just a vibrating \( 2 levels \) machine with attachments that you move around your body manually the vibrations were n't intense enough to make any difference the actual machine has no function the body resurfacing cream which has little scrubbing crystals was ok but can easily be used without this machine	22
0	i bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting by the end of my fitting my feet were throbbing red and pinched literally my pinky toe was purple i bought my true size but i still do n't think these shoes would 've been wearable even with a size larger they must just be really narrow	22
1	i got this product when the price dropped down to 12 so for that price i liked this product a lot it heats the lotion well initially i thought it was small but now i think it is the correct size i did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this i switch it on when i go for a bath and by the time i am back the lotion is ready and warm it is a great buy and for all you bargain shoppers wait till the price drops it is especially a great buy during winter	22

1	in my opinion sony 's strength lies in its tvs this line of lcd sets are expensive but you 'll definitely get what you pay for the picture quality is incredible ! the beauty of this set is also material it is a work of art while the internal speakers are decent i would have been just as happy not to have them but thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel you do n't even know the speakers are there some reviewers have mentioned lcd clouding and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate google search but sony stands by its products and if you receive a set that is not up to standards they will rectify the situation also many reviewers are mentioning a lower quality picture it is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the tv and what signal will give you the optimal image not all hd signals are the same and will provide you with varying degrees of quality be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device but i have yet to see a signal that was n't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous panasonic tube set the interchangable bezels is a nice idea but only for those with deep \( er \) pockets the silver set alone is beautiful and if i had only one complaint it would be that it 's harder to get matching sony peripherals in silver than you might think all in all it 's the best lcd you can buy	22

1	works great out of the box some reviews mentioned problems with the cd but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try it mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet no problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems the brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and i use it as a night light in the kitchen the remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater \( magnet \) with my wife useing it to hang things this is a thomson inc product \( purchased the ge rca names several years ago \) that makes tv 's ect i am very happy with the product and recommend it	22
0	this sounds great in theory being that you do n't have to get under the car to drain the oil fantastic ! but while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars i do n't quite agree you still have to get under the car to change the oil filter so i 'd suggest saving 50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car which is actually faster than using this device	22
0	i would give this toy a 0 if it was an option when you unfold the tiny track and get the train going it ca n't even make one corner turn without coming off the track ! the train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track this is very frustrating for my kids and i cannot believe they even put this on the market \? you ca n't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it i am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is we wanted this toy for portability our kids also have the geotrax working railway which is awesome but not as portable	22
1	i only have a couple of problems with this remote you have to keep pressing the buttons for dvd vcr audio sat etc to change the setting that sounds like i'm complaining a lot and i am \( sue me ha ha \) the other is this i bought this as a replacement for a remote that quit working i ca n't teach it the functions that i need through the learn command since the orginal remote quit which kind of defeats the purpose of having a new remote i have one of those all in in one home theater units and the remote would n't allow me to set the vcr clock and local channels after a power outage other than that i have no problem with it	22

0	this is a good book but most are under the impression that einstein actually created the content of the book einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest german and italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory for instance e mc 2 was not created by einstein as so many people people an italian physicist came up with it if you do n't believe me check any encyclopedia einstein suceeded in taking everyone 's work and compiling it this was helpful to the world of physics unfortunately this stuff is outdated and autodynamics has disproven many things that einstein says in this book when it came out it was already outdated this was published in the 60s autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s \( 45 i believe \) if this was published in the 20s or even the 30s it would have been a good book	22

1	this book is a personal re examination of food what we eat and why we eat it in this book prentice examines food customs and traditions searching for their physiological and environmental rationale her primary observation about food traditions is that they are strictly tied to the seasons and thus the continual year round availability of our foodstuffs has resulted in loss of much traditional knowledge about what is good for us and what is n't in recognition of the essential seasonality of foods prentice organizes this book into the thirteen moons that make up the year from the famine moon to the sap moon from the egg moon to the corn moon from the blood moon to the wolf moon each chapter describes the ecology that led to the association between a particular food item and a specific time of the year in the chapters prentice discusses the nutritional contributions of the featured food items and how her relationship with that food has changed over the years for example she explains how she used to avoid milk and other dairy products but now relishes them as a gift of love from mother earth each chapter also includes recipes of the season ranging from exotic dishes of non western food cultures like cardamom and jaggery pudding to simple directions for lost arts such as rendering pork or making homemade yogurt and sauerkraut prentice was once a strict vegan who for health reasons eventually found herself drawn to a diet which includes animal products but not the products of industrial agriculture there is much that vegetarians and vegans would not like in prentice 's essays since she explains how her 10 years of vegetarianism were not healthy for her having had the same experience myself after being a vegetarian for 20 years i can appreciate the wisdom in what she writes while vegetarian diets work well for some they are not appropriate for everybody but at the same time diets that include the consumption of industrially produced and processed animal products do nobody any good we need to be willing to recognize our relation and responsibilities to the animals that we consume i first heard of this book when i attended a vermont localvore potluck at which prentice was the invited guest chef i was deeply offended then at her attitude when she announced she was going to make a salad using a recipe from her book but lamented the lack of local artichokes or olive oil `how could such a person be associated with local cooking ' i wondered `if she does n't even have the sense to find out what the best local ingredients are and celebrate them instead of parading the products of another region in front of us \? ' i figured that a seasonal local cookbook written by a national author would be a worthless concept fortunately that 's not what this book attempts instead the book is much more about rediscovering our connection to food than about specific local recipes although she has become famous for leading the concept of eating foods only from one 's local region what she urges here is really an appreciation for the products of small farms thus instead of simply cheering on local food prentice argues in this book that our industrial agriculture system has torn us away from one of the most essential of human traits our relationship to the food that nourishes us instead of following diets of avoidance prentice advocates recognizing the meaning that each item of food brings to our lives and using food to re establish our connection to the land indeed the only foods that prentice avoids are those heavily processed products of industrial agriculture refined sugar white flour and pre packaged extruded junk although the book contains a few recipes it is not a cookbook but rather a wake up call our poor diet is at least partly a physical manifestation of a spiritual decay together with some suggestions of how we can begin the journey back to healthy eating	22

0	i owned this set for about 2 and a half years before i finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers \( i used it about 4 5 times per year \) first off the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head second the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair third the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use i would roll up my hair \( which would take like 30 minutes because of the difficulty \) and if i walked around the house to watch tv while i waited for my hair to set the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room i eventually lost like 6 clips from the springing out thing the results of these rollers were great though i used them on my wedding day and people loved it good results but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers	22
0	i bought this toy from my son for his 2nd birthday less than a week ago it is designed for the sandbox but has already stopped working because sand has gotten into all the sliding parts it also has a locking mechanism that is too difficult for even my almost 4 year old to figure out but my kids love to ride around on it it 's just too bad the rest of it is so poorly designed	22

1	this game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious you will need a lot of patience to play it	22
0	this game has a good concept nice graphics and some definitely funny moments but the gameplay is a total bore there are two main gameplay styles investigation and trial investigation is the worst it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room talking to everyone and a ton of pointless reading much like an old point and click adventure on pc the court sections are a little better but not much once again it 's very linear you do n't have to use your brain much just try all the options and once again there is a huge amount of reading there is way too much dialogue packed into the game and not near enough actual gameplay and most of the talking is aimless too very little of it actually advances the plot overall this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text	22

0	i would n't recommend this movie unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone due to a high content of bad words screaming and violence it 's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else some people really enjoyed it and that 's not me and that 's not the other two people i know who watched it some violent parts are a bit hard to believe but i guess that 's what the story is about this movie is a bit of a hollywood style suspense with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies there 's one good idea in this movie and that 's how life develops as it goes along and one action or inaction changes how life plays out but this is no where near original even the simpsons had an episode like that so this movie is definitely not on my best movies list	22

1	in many languages around the world chai simply means tea in india however the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the west is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers spiced milk tea chai comes in a variety of recipes that differ from region to region although traditionally it consists of a blend of black tea rich milk various spices and a sweetner the spices most commonly used are cardamom cinnamon ginger cloves and pepper tazo 's very peppery chai adds rooibos vanilla star anise and chicory to the traditional recipe you should always have this tea with real sugar even if you have all your regular tea without any kind of sweetener because only sugar will bring out the full flavor of the spices and if you like your store bought chai maybe you 'll one day try brewing chai from fresh black tea and spices too ! namaste	22
1	well of course it 's that hokey romantic type and of course you see the ending coming from a mile away of course we 've seen it all before but as far as entertainment value goes it 's got it reese witherspoon proves once again that she can flesh out an otherwise empty character and give it some personality there 's really not much to the characters in this movie but there does n't need to be i was a little wary of the jon heder character having just come off the great napolean dynamite buzz but i found his character interesting and did n't think he had nearly enough time to flesh it out but he did a good job with what he had you do n't have to bust your brain trying to figure out this one but it works when you 're in the mood for a straightforward romance it is what it is	22

0	i bought this upgrade because i thought it would let me share my contacts it says so on the box but it does n't it works just like the old contacts which you ca n't share with others except if you export it no live sharing why could n't they make it so i could put the file on my server \? or on a secure site \? then all my office can work off one contact list 50 or more of the time the business contacts ca n't be found when you search for a contact it 's like the business contacts is an add in that does n't work with outlook or you add contacts save it email to the saved email address and then go to find the contact later and it is gone also lots of times when you try to send the email wo n't send it stays in the outbox and repeatedly you open and hit the send button but it wo n't change to send status now if you leave it in the outbox sometimes that fools the program into letting you send other email or sometimes you can forward and send geez what a waste of money this upgrade was we wo n't be using it on any of our other computers and we have n't bought if on the new computers we have ordered	22

1	i first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure it got me curious as they rarely do passing sephora i went in for a test and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent it seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo after a few days i still could n't get the scent out of my head so i went back to grab it up i 've only had this experience with a few other fragrences but they were of a totally different style angel by thierry mugler and flower by kenzo	23
0	i was really disappointed with this item especially as it 's nutrition info is really amazing it 's very gritty and strong tasting and did not blend well it 's also dark green which is n't a big deal for a lot of items but can turn things a very weird color depending on what you blend it with i am returning them as there are better tasting and equally nutritious protein powders available	23

1	after playing grand theft auto iii i thought there was no way rockstar could top themselves in fact when the advance word for this game got out i actually thought this was nothing more than an add on for gta3 stupid thought i know on the whole gta vc is bigger badder and more audacious than gta3 ever was so here 's the story in 1986 tommy vercetti a hitter for the forelli crime family in liberty city is finally released from prison sonny forelli his boss immediately sends him down to vice city to close a major drug deal being handled by ken rosenberg a shyster lawyer and the forellis' contact no sooner is the deal closed than gunmen break it all up kill everyone but tommy and ken and take both the drugs and the cash now tommy has to recover the money for sonny but before long he decides to make a name for himself in this town the setting is pure '80s excess through and through if you take the bottomless amoral corruption of scarface the day glo polyester fashion of miami vice and the innate cheesy greed of ronald reagan 's 1980s american culture you 'll have vice city you 'll see it in the fashion sense of the citizens the local architecture and the cars tooling around on the road you 'll even hear it in the radio stations which boast an array of heavy metal dance latino and bubblegum pop music the like of which you have n't even thought of since the '80s i swear try listening to one of the radio stations and see if the memories do n't come flooding back the voice acting is as usual superb ray liotta did an outstanding job bringing tommy vercetti to life and in making an otherwise loathsome sociopath into a strangely likable character and there are others as well burt reynolds dennis hopper gary busey lee majors fairuza balk and robert davi all turn in great performances but philip michael thomas who played don johnson 's partner tubbs on miami vice gets special mention in more ways than one his character lance vance is the one to keep an eye on while the main story missions only take up a third of the game itself it 's the addition of a new feature that not only rounds things out it also adds length to the game and really makes you feel like you 're establishing a criminal empire they 're called asset properties at a certain point in the game you have the option of buying certain businesses once you buy one of these asset properties and you complete its mission strand that business will start generating a daily amount of money for you to pick up some of them are perfectly legitimate such as the taxi company or the nightclub others are a little sketchy like the boatyard or the strip club but others are absolutely illegal like the protection rackets the ice cream company or the car showroom they add a great amount of depth and they let you establish contacts across town needless to say once sonny forelli comes to town to check up on you make no mistake he 's now in your town so if you feel the need to get away from it all and indulge your inner tony montana book a trip to vice city like san andreas it 's a great place to visit and unwind and also like san andreas you 'll be glad you do n't live there	23

0	i have been using turbo tax since 1998 i use computers every day and \( as an engineer \) i am used to using difficult applications \( pro e mathcad ug etc \) this years edition of turbo tax deluxe was the worst turbo tax i have ever seen \( i usually like it very much \) i purchased in january and had to update 4 times one update took 6 hours \( some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option \) in addition the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable \( farm income at the pa state form \) when i tried to delete the entries \( at the federal level as instructed \) they would not my 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated \( copy 2 and every time i deleted it it would reappear on the next pass through every time i entered the state tab it acted like i was never there before with a start state button that always lead me through all the same questions \( it did retain my answers from prior visits \) where was the continue state button \? i also noticed that using the back button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur even though the same foreward choices were made once i backed up to check something then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from 46 to 1548 ! ! upon backing up i saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked i did not check them but rather backed up two more screens then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked ! one more foreward click and my taxes again returned to 46 one of the years i liked best was when there was a checklist so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed this years state was definetly worse than the federal but even that was a dissapointment i did complete this years filings submitted both online i hope i do n't get burned ! turbo tax ! please improve for next year or it may be my last year you realize that at 59 95 39 95 filing my time aggravation like this year and an accountant is looking attractive if you are on the inside you probably know why this is happening outsourcing code gen to india not outsourcing code gen to india programmer cut backs programming application changes archiving application changes project management issues whatever just realize that there is a problem fix it	23
1	this is truly a good system iv'e sat on it dropped it kicked it thrashed it and it still is working fine i did consider buying the psp at first but then i thought i have an ipod nano a dvd player and a laptop i didn 't see the point for having 2 of the above also honsetly who would want to go on the web with a slow psp can you imagine how hard it is to type ! ! anyway the games i recommend for the nds is mario kart ds animal crossing megaman battle network five and for people that are reall hard core gamers spiderman \( this is an extrmeley har game trust me \) also i do find picto chat quite usless 33ft range is n't enough also i was reading the psp reviews and about 85 percent of them said that the psp is for more mature gamers what got me is that alot of kid reviews were saying that all these kids playing m rated games is sorta scary but that 's just my opion also if you have the fat ds dont buy a ds lite thres no need unless your eyesight is bad all it has is a brighter screen and a sleeker design so it 's not werth it once again this is only my opion im just giving my advice the wifi feature is pretty cool i am aware that psp has this too by the way anyway mario kart ds does a great job usuing wi fi the feeling of sitting in your room playing with people across the world on this handheld is quite an extroindary feeling well all in all if you really need a gaming device with good grapghics and multi media features get the psp but im warning you it is very very fragile if you have a music device and a computer and just want a good gaming system with great games and is very durable get nds they are both good systems just think about what you need in a system do you want a gaming device or a multimedia device its your choice in the end i hope this review has helped i just want to make your shopping a tad bit easiers cheers hisham amery	23
1	note this review is spoiler free with regards to the game 's storyall good things must eventually come to an end such as the star wars series the lord of the rings trilogy and the jak and daxter trilogy \( not including the racing game and daxter 's own psp game \) after two excellent games our favorite elfin friend and his furry sidekick come to the last entry in the jak trilogy the big question is is it a good ending \? i'm pleased to say that overall yes jak 3 takes place an undetermined time after the conclusion of jak 2 haven city has become divided after relentless attacks by robots metal heads and other nasties the population blames jak for these problems and he finds himself flown out to the wasteland a harsh and unforgiving desert where nobody can survive without help abandoned by those he saved jak and his buddy daxter set out on thier final adventure like it 's two predecessors jak 3 is a platforming game combined with a gun shooter you get various jumps kicks punches and leaps and you also get a wide array of firearms to take out your foes when your fancy kung fu and karate are n't enough jak 's moves remain largely unchanged from jak 2 \( which will now be called j2 \) he can still punch like a man jump like a kangaroo and leap like a bullfrog gunplay remains pretty much the same as well you get four guns \( blaster rifle machine gun and peacemaker \) but in a nice twist each weapon gets various upgrades as the game goes on the rifle for example starts out in it 's default setting hower the next upgrade allows it to shoot richochet bullets while the third upgrade gives it a flying platform that shoots bullets in all directions each gun has three upgrades and playing with them is a blast the peace maker for example can fire a shot that paralyzes all enemies and makes them float around \( whee ! \) while it 's final upgrade well let 's just say that you 'll be shooting mini nukes a lot the biggest change to jak 's game play comes in the form of vehicles while j2 had flying vehicles and zoomers jak 3 has cars \( and not the nice talking pixar kind \) because half the game is set in the desert jak and daxter get around on dune buggies there are eight of them and each has various unique traits some are really really fast one can jump riddiculously high \( wheee ! \) and some of them will spin out of control at the slightest twitch of the control stick \( boo ! \) you 'll be spending a lot of time driving the buggies and for the most part it 's enjoyable and fun though some of them \( such as the sand shark \) can be a bit difficult to handle another new feature of jak 3 is the sheer size of it j1 and j2 had two enormous areas to run around in here you have not one not two but three yes three ! gigantic areas to run around in and like the previous games there are no loading times an astonishing feat considering how enormous both worlds \( spargus city the wasteland and haven city \) are you 'll definatly see a lot of amazing sights during your trips throughout jak 3 's world \( such as how haven city has ahem changed since the last game \) dark jak powers return as well but are now balanced by a new side to our hero light jak if dark jak is the attacking force light jak is the defensive force dark allows you to kill things really quickly while light allows you to heal fly \( this is so awesome ! \) surround yourself with an inpenetrable shield and even slow down time to a crawl both powers can be activated at any time as long as you have light and dark eco in your meters and in a very nice touch you can stop being light or dark at a touch of a button to save your energy for when you really need it while both light and dark do come into play at vital moments during gameplay both are really just a little added bonus to spice up gameplay when you want to as you can play throughout the game without needing to use either force \( except for scripted moments where you need to \) but then again being able to heal yourself whenever you want is a very handy thing ! smile like j2 jak 3 has you going from place to place talking to people and doing what they tell you to do and when you finish with that you head over to the next person and do what they want to do etc it 's a linear system that makes it easy to tell where to go and what to do next and it sounds fairly restrictive but it does have one big strength you do n't have to start the next mission until you want to if you want you can wander around the wasteland blowing up wanderers for twenty hours go hunt down twelve precurser orbs and watch the sun go up and down three times and then tackle the mission this free roaming system allows you to do what you 'd like to do if you do n't feel like doing missions for a while one thing i 'd like to address before we go any further is the difficulty level if one takes a look at my review for j2 one can find a lot of anger and hatred directed towards naughty dog for making j2 the most unnecessarily hardest game i 've ever played \( and it still is by the way tied only with spider man for ps2 \) i am very pleased that naughty dog towned down the difficulty a lot for jak 3 no longer does each and every mission require twenty attempts before you pass it and no longer will you be throwing the controller into the tv while screaming obscenities becuase that a hole errol won that fricken race again here the difficulty seems just right not too hard not too easy most missions require a few attempts before they are completed and a few can be finished on one try there are still a few that are quite difficult and one or two that are grit your teeth inducing but overall nothing as infuriating as many moments from the previous entry in the series oh and there are only a few go through the ring missions this time around thank goodness in addition to the free roaming gameplay there are also plenty of secrets to unlock in this quest there are over 600 precurser orbs to find and collect in jak 3 and by doing so you get to unlock various features such as unlimited dark and light jak power invincibility extra vehicles various weapon upgrades etc while some are hidden behind corners many of these orbs are collected by doing various challenges that people throw your way such as searching around a paticular area going through rings \( grumbles \) following a little blue light and even stopping time there are plenty of things to do to get those little shiny orbs but the results are well worth it in addition jak 3 arguably has the best moments in the series in terms of wow factor fighting a gigantic sixty story tall monster with only a dune buggy is a moment that sends shivers down your spine even with all these fine points jak 3 does stutter a little bit in what is arguably the most important part of the game the story j2 is most memorable to me for it 's story it had many twists and turns and you never really knew what to expect next the story in jak 3 is a good one and it does keep your interest in what is going to happen next but ultimitly it left me unsatisfied how so \? the three biggest ones are charachters the precursers and the ending and for those of you worrying that i'm going to tell you who the precursers are \( which i wo n't \) i'm going to keep this as spoiler free as i can first off the charachters we have jak and daxter of course and those two are always fun to watch and care about we have many returning charachters such as torn sig and samos and we have some new residents from spargus city the problem \? almost all of the returning charachters have zilch charachter development it 's assumed that you know them from the last game and because of that jak 3 takes no time to explain who they are or what they do that may be okay but pretty much none of the charachters are expanded at all torn is still gruff and tough \( but not as much as last time \) ashelin is the firm leader and samos gives warnings on what may happen to the planet if things go badly keira who was such a vital charachter in j1 and j2 has absoloutly nothing to do in the story aside from look pretty and important sig well he 's just there because he 's cool the only returning charachter who kept me interested was tess who fufills the dumb blonde role her relationship with daxter is sweet and lighthearted and kept my interest easily errol returns as well \( though i wo n't say how \) but he 's gone from insanely irritating to average irritating a sad departure from his compellingly egotistic nature in j2 of the new charachters only one damos kept my interest due to his charachter tough yet gentle and caring at the same time he 's easily the most compelling of jak 's new companions the new villian count veger is n't that compelling though he does have some very powerful scenes \( especially one near the ending \) one of the claims on the back of the game box is that we 'll discover the shocking secret of who the precursers really are as i said earlier i wo n't reveal who the precursers are \( someone did that and ruined the suprise for me \) except that in my personal opinion we should have never find out who the precursers were and leave them as a mystery i personally felt that seeing who they really are sucked out all the suspense and mystery esepcially since they have been talked about at length for two games now it 's like revealing the face of doctor claw when you go back and experience your old memories there is no more mystery or wonder anymore in my personal opinion these beings should have remained hidden forever however the saddest part of the game for me is the ending again i wo n't ruin it for you but it 's always sad when game developers have to wrap an entire trilogy up in three minutes some people criticise the ending of the film return of the king saying that it goes on too long however the ending to the lord of the rings film trilogy took it 's time wrapping up the threads from three movies and bringing closure to the story and leaving one satisfied however jak 3 does n't do that as the game goes on and gets closer to the end the feeling of dread and the idea that everything can be destroyed just vanishes and is pretty much gone by the time the final boss battle comes \( and sadly the battle itself is n't that exciting or memorable \) the ending does end the trilogy but leaves the door wide open for more games \( of which two have already happened \) i 've invested a lot of time on these three games i 've grown attatched to it 's charachters and i would like closure to all thier stories saldy that does n't happen everything is left wide open when in my opinion it should have been closed there is no real ending here at least one that ties everything up nicely but despite my points with the story i do want to stress that jak 3 is a very good game it 's a satisfying blend of storytelling platforming shooting driving and action it 's one of those games where you keep saying just five more minutes just five more minutes only to discover that time has flown by and it 's two in the morning it 's addictive fun and for me a blast to play i definitly recommend it especially if you find it for under twenty dollars	23
1	i have tried other systems before and they took the long way around about getting to the rock and roll stuff i wanted this one however jumps straight into what i wanted to know about rock guitar the teaching method is fantastic the program shows not only where notes would fall but includes a virtual fret board so i can see exactly what to play this feature includes a slow version to start with then a normal speed version that \( in almost every case \) is exactly like the song being heard i have played guitar \( that is fooled with guitar \) for about twenty years this program got me playing and learning every day for a couple hours now i have much more fun jamming and playing songs i have heard i recommend this for anyone beginners to intermediate	23
0	i bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching tv i wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive what it boils down to is that this is a foot hook tied to a bar with a nylon strap the nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly the idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit ups crunches the problem is that the nylon strap does n't actually hold your feet down i wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room negative on both accounts you need a good sturdy door to implement this product and then it still does n't truly hold your feet down looks like i 'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down	23
1	a good friend has this for her daughter i fell in love with it when i saw it completely adorable and works like a charm bought one as a baby gift as well but i 'd kinda like one myself	23

0	the reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna be 's of true cultural wits like mencken and updike some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable i 'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag and save your money to buy books that nourish you	23

1	when you look at the price it may seem pricey but when you get the product there is some serious engineering involved the web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason i bought an ergotron the attention to detail is incredible mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two person job other than that the installation was flawless this is a very solid and well machined kudos to ergotron \( also these guys are serious about ergonomics 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations \) wonderful product 5 stars shipping from amazon was slow and behind schedule	23

0	this album was released in 1999 and now seven years later this album does not even matter britney spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity innovation creativity and ability to transcend cultures and generations great music stirs something inside the listener and matters to the person who created it britney spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things it saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally and yet the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years decades even after their release music like this britney spears and her peers disappears into the folds of time it does not matter	23

1	i just bought a xbox 360 pro system a couple of weeks ago from my local gamespot store along with call of duty 3 i later on got gears of war from circuit city the xbox 360 pro system is by far the best console system out there no matter what anybody says for the money yes the sony playstation 3 has the blu ray disc media format and the nintendo wii system has the new remote controller for 3 d movement but both the playstation 3 and the nintendo wii console systems just came out and both systems already have major bugs in them there are already alot of people out there who regret buying one of those systems if your smart you 'll wait a year until all the bugs are fix in both those console systems and then think about purchasing one of those systems that is what i did with the xbox 360 yes there were major problems with the xbox 360 when it first came out just like there are major problems now with the playstation 3 and the nintendo wii console systems i waited a year until microsoft fixed all the bugs in the xbox 360 and then i went out and purchased it right now the xbox 360 has the best selection of games out there the xbox live marketplace is the best online service out there go read the reviews for the few games that are out for the playstation 3 and you will see what i mean about which system has better games to play there are already a huge selection of games to play on the xbox 360 with a whole bunch of new games for the xbox 360 coming out next year unfortunately there are not too many new games coming out for the playstation 3 or the nintendo wii next year also the nintendo wii has very poor graphics and you ca n't play dvd movies on it and the playstation 3 has very few games to choose from to play and it also has poor online service the xbox 360 is already one year ahead of the other two systems on being out in the retail market and that my friend will make a huge difference on which system to choose from to go out to buy and play	23

1	these are quite good tasting ! even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time it would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also did n't have to be bought 'in bulk ' but overall they 're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings	23
1	my husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots i also like the fact you can buy them in black and amazon had a fantastic price on them i do n't know the wearability of the socks since i just got them for my husband for christmas i bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay no holes in the toes yet ! overall i think the socks are great	23

0	i started reading this immediately after the last reh compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling while reh was first and foremost a story teller pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather 's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous alcibiades this as previous reviewers have mentioned creates a large gap between reader and story but why do this \? why use such a crappy method of story telling \? i guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue all in all it 's a slow uninspired day dream story so crappy that i felt it necessary to write this review echoing previous harsh reviews i want my money back	23

1	we have purchased this ramen at a store that specializes in asian food there are numerous varieties of ramen so you have to try many of them to find those that you think have the best flavor we were a bit apprehensive the first time we tried this ramen however it has since become one of our favorites the spice is hot but it adds a really good flavor to the noodles a real winner when you are in the mood for spicy food or on a cold day because this ramen is very hot we have also mixed a package of this ramen with a package of chicken ramen to lower the chemical heat even with such a mixture the soup is still fairly hot when i say hot i mean spicy hot for many people medium hot is incredibly hot but i can barely discern any spice in medium hot salsa i am accustomed to eating spicy mexican food and korean food so when i say this soup is hot you have a good reference	23
1	i love to cook i am not a professional by all means but i do enjoy the concept of preparing food other than tv bon appetit is one of my main sources i refer to that inspires me to create my next meal i have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now i have to admit i do n't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that i read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue \( i love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years \) and thanksgiving what i am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end from my point of view a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make i am blessed to live in a big city where i can find most of the ingredients but if i lived in a smaller city or town it probably would be difficult to find these recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed all in all i still enjoy reading bon appetit and being inspired by the magazine	23

0	many albums including this one have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting except for the first two tracks the use of many poetry elements in their lyrics ca n't save the blandness of the music what about everything and life less ordinary are good songs the rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep	23
0	two main problems with this cordless massager the first being that it does n't hold a charge for very long you may get an hour use on a full charge and that shows diminishing power as it goes add to that it 's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment if you 're looking for something to rumble a slight bit this is for you otherwise save your money	23

0	this is the 7th olympus camera i 've owned over the years from film to digital i have always been very pleased with olympus cameras and their usual superior optics this camera though is a major disappointment mainly because even though it can shoot in raw there is no compatible conversion available yet leaving you unable to process raw images this renders the camera worthless at this time for serious pictures as you have no choice but to shoot in jpeg olympus should have ensured that vendors such as adobe had the necessary information to make the compatible raw conversion plug ins available before this camera hit the market there 's no excuse for olympus to not have made sure this was the case indeed it 's downright irresponsible having said the above the camera lens is quite nice the camera itself operates well you can take quite good pictures however the camera is not suitable for flash pictures in medium to low light situations as there is significant lag time from the time you press the shutter to the picture actually being taken if you 're taking pictures of people they will have moved by the time the picture is taken the battery life is very good the camera fits nicely in your palm and having a 28 500 mm lens is great if you do n't shoot in raw and you do n't depend on flash photography the camera is worth a look otherwise look at other products at this time	23

0	update i think i 've figured out why they 've made the changes which take away much of the magick that is riverdance the people i work with know how crazy i am about all things celtic so bless 'em they thought i would like michael flatley 's latest creation celtic tiger and got me that for my holiday gift this year after watching that hideously tacky travesty of a show it seems like whoever is in charge of rd these days is trying to compete with sacred meets vegas and vegas wins junk that mr flatley has produced ! so come on take rd back to it 's magickal lovely sacred roots ! what are they thinking \? who changed the number that originally featured davey spillane playing the pipes \? why on earth would anyone want to take one of the most soul hauntingly lovely pieces of sacred musick ever written amd make subtle alterations to it \? and the sound quality of the tape leaves a lot to be desired ! as always the performers are awesome ! and i 've gotten over the trauma of knowing that i 'll never get to see michael and jean live ! just kidding about the trauma part however the rd of my dreams definietely has those two in the lead roles ! but come on a lugh with black hair ! the best lugh i 've actually seen live was patrick roddy the best brigit i 've seen live is eileen martin the last time i saw rd live was about a year ago and this was the version that i saw and it kind of made me think that rd was trying to go hollywood ! however there were a few good things about the changes the narration about how it 's all a journey from one lifetime to the next and the inclusion of the shivna number ! it 's quite good ! i would n't realy advise buying this tape unless you are a rd nut like i am and buy anything about rd that you can get your hands on !	23

0	the slick stylish spanish thriller nobody knows anybody is set in seville during holy week in the year 2000 newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would be writer simon cardenas \( eduardo noriega \) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word adversary as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue since the message also contained threats simon does what he 's told and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events directed by mateo gil nobody knows anything opens with a scene of a man stabbed to death with a crucifix through his heart and this scene is one of the ideas that feeds the notion you are about to see some sort of horror film with religious overtones but the plot moves away from the horror aspect into straight thriller territory the film which owes much of its style to american thrillers is slickly produced and the exotic settings of the sights and sounds of seville help but the preposterous plot with its huge gaps in logic and implausibility ultimately left this viewer disappointed and feeling a bit cheated by the experience i was intrigued at first by the film and drawn into the plot however once the plot and the mystery aspect became clear \( and i ca n't give away too much here \) the film became silly and trite there 's little character development our hero is a flat dull passive character and the film 's emphasis is on the thrill aspect a slick product that is ultimately empty and really ridiculous this film is in spanish with english subtitles displacedhuma	23

1	this movie is high in my top 10 off all times list and is probably the best 'mainstream hollywood' movie i can think of i watched it for the 3rd or 4th time and it is just as enjoying thrilling and suspenseful as it was when i saw it first more than 10 years ago my 12 years old daughter watched it with me for the first time and enjoyed it just as well great performance by all cast but especially hanks paxton and beacon probably ron howard best film ever	23

0	i was so excited to see this game come out i loved the godfather and from russia with love and the hype surrounding this game was incredible the actual game however was incredibly disappointing the driving controls especially compared to the driving controls in the godfather are awful i was having so much trouble driving i kept looking through the handbook to see if i was doing something wrong but from what i saw i was using the controller the way i was supposed to most of the missions involve driving under a specific time limit and with these awful controls i gave up early way too frustrating the musical play list that you get to control was fun but i would have liked more free roaming like in the godfather i was also looking forward to hearing everyone 's voices that were in the opening credits dale earnhardt jr \? \? \? but since i have almost totally given up on it now i guess i wo n't get to hear their voice acting talent does anyone know if they plan to re release this on the xbox 360 \? maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then this game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to	23

1	this film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9 11 \( it 's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb \) i also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on tim allen and the comparisons to get shorty rather than as a plot driven movie i tell you though this film is simply funny just like an old marx brothers film the plot is there only to set in motion the quick witted dialogue and interaction between the characters i have enjoyed both of dave barry 's humor novels \( this and tricky business \) they made me laugh out loud as did this movie i think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly for those that have laughed at dennis farina from his roles in get shorty and even snatch he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks \( literally \) on his trip to do a quick sniper job tom sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you 'll ever see there are some movies that you may see once in the theaters yet can watch over and over everytime it is on tv because it retains the ability to always make you laugh no matter how many times you have seen it check this one out !	23

1	katamari damacy is one of the best games ever made it 's also the freshest game do n't let the kiddie theme deter you this is extremely playable for anyone the music has very good genre recordings some of them are accoustic jazz studio recordings in japanese but the jazz sound is there especially in gin tonic red red roses which is a noir ish 15 minute scat vocal swing track with percussion piano double bass and flute the game has a two player mode which is set in an arena as a competition to see who 's better the one player mode is the story driven mode about the king of the cosmos father of your protagonist who is a little green guy that looks similar to a teletubby the objective is to use the two analog sticks to make the character push around a small ball inside a garden or the rooms in a house or both into objects normally found in those three dimensional environments such as pairs of scissors mice golf balls flowers paperclips dining chairs spoons anything and everything the rolling of the ball has a snowball effect which means the more things your character rolls up into the ball the larger the ball becomes there 's a big transition moment in the game where after rolling the ball around the rooms of a house the character breaks out of the house down the driveway to a farmer 's market on the other side of the street where he starts rolling in watermelons until the ball gets even larger and rolls in bicycles little kids and then adults the game play is a surreal fantasy but it all comes together in its finale with an abstract epiphany that the world is a small enough place to understand each other when replacing the unnecessary with the meaningful the more i played this game the hungrier i got and the ending surprised me with an epiphany it 's by namco who as you know is the japanese company that produced the original pac man arcade game since then it has produced several genre games for sony 's playstation including the soul edge series soul blade and soul calibur the tekken series the ridge racer rage racer series and the ace combat air combat series all of which has been prime landmarks in that console 's history this game is so fresh it struck a blow to me strangely it is one of those japanese releases that almost did n't make it over to america when it was brand new its list price was only 20 most games are 50 upon release the raving critical success and the sleeper hit popularity of this game garnered a sequel but i have n't played it yet at any rate it just may continue on as one of namco 's great series if it maintains the inertia of this original one	23

0	while many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror in my more than four decades on this planet there is only one film that caused such a level of disbelief disgust and abhorrence that i actually walked out of a theater halfway through its showing it was a film so onerous pointless and unfunny that it stands in the pantheon of some of the most colossal wastes of time money and talent in the history of western civilization that film is cabin boy to some cabin boy may well serve as the cornerstone of an evening 's entertainment assuming the evening also features sock puppets and pirate hats made out of newspaper imagine watching someone pick at a zit for several hours then eat a sandwich that 's the kind of inventive knee slapping laugh out loud fun you 'll find in cabin boy having some respect for chris elliott 's work on the old letterman show on nbc i was profoundly disappointed by this unspeakably inept attempt at humor if it does n't induce deep rem sleep cabin boy will surely leave you either angry or depressed one would venture to guess these were not the results elliott intended letterman 's genius level cameo notwithstanding cabin boy is about as funny as a prostate exam without the local and the lube	23

0	let me start by saying that i may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co workers in regards to movies to watch at least when it comes to the horror genre numerous people where i work told me that this movie the descent was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made in their defense my co workers were n't the only people with this opinion many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing well apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to because i was sorely disappointed but more on that later for now i will give you my plot summary for last year 's supposed horror spectacular the descent the descent begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident one year later at the prodding of those same friends she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave in fact it 's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave making matters worse this cave is not like any ordinary cave for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story and the shocking opener really caught my attention giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected however once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave which is actually where the majority of the film takes place things begin to go awry for the picture at first the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie this is a cave that no one has been in and these girls are hardly professional so who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave it 's absolutely stupid especially when placed viewed in the context of the character 's interaction and companionship with each other none of these girls would do this to each other after this occurs the mutants show up a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction however this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster because it 's now just one gory scene after another and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie a decision i somewhat agreed with yet still did n't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls you just assume they 're cannibalistic but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there even though the descent was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity the descent is unrated and contains violence and language	23

1	hi i just recently purchased this phone and so far these are the problems yes you do have to restart the device it does get hung but i do n't blame the phone after all it has windows mobile 5 in it the restart has occurred twice to me in the past week so be careful this phone is pretty close to being perfect other than the fact that it has windows the 3g connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have if you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature which in return will give u a nice thick bill once you buy the phone i suggest that you get this software spb pocket plus it helps shutting down softwares running in the background and adds more features the screen clarity is amazing and it has great features it can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware the one star missing is cause it has windows sorry microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too	23
1	celestron 's tool is easy to carry easy to use and \( at least in my case ! \) gives me quick precision collimation with my newtonian why pay for a laser collimator \( which needs to be calibrated \) when you can use this \? collimation is the most important part of your setup without good mirror alignment all you 'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights this combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless and also fairly fast highly recommended for any level of observer	23
0	i am sorry to say that i thoroughly disliked of human bondage i know it is on every must read list for fiction \( which is why i decided to read it \) however i just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature \? not only did i find it dull but i was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character 's perception of women ! i'm not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways yellow teethed sallow skin dirty hands tear stained over powdered face it goes on and on i wondered if the author was uncomfortable women \? i looked online for some information about maugham to my surprise i found out that maugham was bisexual he did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men in no way can i say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book but in some way it answered my question or concern instead of this book i 'd recommend the following classics beautiful and damned by f scott fitzgerald madame bovary by flaubert at least in these books maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional good or bad	23
0	the camera is decent the fact that it does n't come with the correct cable nor software to transfer video to a computer is unacceptable what do they expect 90 of consumers are going to do with it	23
0	this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making x men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke	23
0	i purchased the 75 300mm for a trip to a nascar nextel cup championship in homestead fl i was mostly disappointed with the lens from the beginning the lens is not very sharp feels very cheap and the autofocus is slow and hilariously innaccurate in low light i packed up and returned the lens about an hour after i got off the plane i am going to save my money for something sturdier and with a better maximum aperture i suggest you do the same	23
0	i ordered a swarovsky crystal pendant which i thought was clear like one i had purchased once on a visit to a swarovsky factory the one i received is clear but not like the first one it is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one i was disappointed	23

1	after doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model i decided to purchase this shredder so far it was a wise decision i have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money i have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome i put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag and i can just keep reusing the same bag it really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working no jams etc great buy !	23

0	but the touch wheel is harder to use i bought this case about a month ago and immediately put my baby into it since that point time i had a harder time turning it off pausing adjusting the volume using the back and forth touch points and setting a stop point in a audiobook this is the result of the mini being recessed into the case i took my mini out of the case today and had immediate ease of use with the touch wheel again the case will protect your mini without a doubt but you lose the functionality that the wheel is so popular for also make sure you tighten down the pivot head with a screwdriver since i nearly almost lost my mini because it came apart from the belt clip i 'll only use when absolutely necessary now	23
1	i got this cam as a gift and it is very nice and sleek and easy to use ! the pictures are nice and it is light and easy to have it with youeverywhere	23
0	i'm an avid tony yayo fan but this album just did n't cut it maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure i do n't know but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them hopefully his next album will be way better a few songs are good to listen to i would think coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about but so seductive being your first single \? \? come on i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean rating c	23

1	fast delivery great price i would buy from them again thanks	23
0	the sony mdr if3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear perhaps if one were an elf or a small child they would fit properly however if you 're like me a mere adult mortal they probably wo n't fit you they would be okay for simple stereo listening but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description if you 're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie the sony mdr if8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money	23
1	i am enjoying the sneakers this summer comfy perfect for elliptical trainer stationery bike and weight room very stylish i love skechers footwear	23

0	i bought the duro med 7921lcst bg because of a back injury i need good back support in order to sit somewhat comfortably this product is very disappointing the material with which it is filled is of such a low density that it gives practically no support at all if you need firm back support i would look elsewhere \( i do n't know of a good source yet \) if you do n't need such support then i do n't know why you 'd have any interest in this product but i suppose there could be valid reasons that i ca n't imagine	23

1	it 's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that xtc 's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70 's first wave of british punk rock those were different times after all you could n't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky jerky spastic wit of quot white music quot come to think of it not many people could make much sense of it back then either andy partridge 's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than quot pop quot and barry andrews' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song nevertheless the album worked it rocked in its own art damaged way and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation that lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the fab four 's quot hard day 's night quot was cleverly appropriated for the intro to quot this is pop quot a few songs later dylan 's quot all along the watchtower quot got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia there may have been more intense punk artifacts from the class of '78 but not many were anywhere near as smart as quot white music quot	23
0	i purchased partition magic 8 0 based on my previous experience with symantec virus protection and firewall products i am sorry that i did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by symantec for other products that i have purchased from them all i wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my c drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive i was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with symantec technical support i was only able to speak to technical support staff in india who finally told me that they could not solve my problem but that i would be called back by a senior engineer it never happened despite repeated promises i finally gave up and returned the product to symantec for a refund	23
0	just received one for my son 's birthday he loves it as he has a laptop like daddy the quality is terrible like another user 's experience the right side of the device does n't work properly and this is brand new apparently the sensors on the device do n't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side i ca n't exchange it as i am not in the us so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are this of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old ps the box says for 4 8 yr olds vs amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer	23
0	i though i hated yu gi oh because mostly everyone i played against summoned like a dark magician without even sacrificing weird right \( so instead i bought the computer yugi the destiny 2 learn how 2 play im a very good duelist now because i have 2 god cards obelisk and shining dragon so i bought this deck and i found this deck was unstoppable	23

1	this is a wonderful cover for your blackberry very sturdy and easy to use love it !	23
1	this is a really nice little bomb and smells of those little candy conversation hearts that come out for valentine 's day each year sort of tangy and light and sweet but as with all that lush does there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again the tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation according to the first lush times catalog it appeared in so whenever i am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake i bathe in this and feel better it also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits the only downside to this bomb is that the scent does n't linger much at all once you get out of the bath which is disappointing to me since it smells so good ! still it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one i come back to time and time again	23
1	this game has outstanding graphics and great 3 d gameplay plus you can really battle it out online or in instant action to add to the few you can play in the clone wars or the galactic civil war the bad thing though is that in the clone wars the main battles are on naboo to be honest the clone wars started on geonosis and are in episode ii not i i love this game because you can use guns and other awesome weapons and you can also play as the wookies clones droids rebels and imperials if you are a beginner video game player or new to star wars when you choose create file try using easy this game follows the movies really well and you can explore mos eisley or maybe naboo if you like the more battles you win the bonuses you get if you read the instruction booklet it says if you go on a killing spree against the enemies you get a really cool bonus i highly recommend this game to all star wars fans ! the game will let you play the most greatest battles of all time so if you want a good long lasting game try this i really hope star wars fans will love the game multi player mode is great and i really enjoy playing it this game is great and i love it try playing it for yourself ! i am about to wrap this review up so listen that this game is great for the xbox and has terrific gameplay and features that you will want to play it all the time even though it is online or single player you can still have fun and know it is all out star wars action ! this game is great and i just love playing it ! i know that this is one out of two battle front games soon to be three i enjoy playing this ! buy it now ! p s buy every thing star wars	23
0	the book i am going to talk about is the book arms and the man by bernard shaw i really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand the reason i did n't like it was because it was challenging for me the english was hard to understand i liked how the writer wrote the book and i would probably look for another one of his books this book was more like an opera with out music if i could have and known to i probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book one reason i picked the book was because it was dealing with war and i thought it would have been cool to read about war but when i got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war if you 're an older audience it would be a good book or if you 're looking for a good love war story	23
0	i have been using frederic fekkai 's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so i thought i would try the luscious curls it was very thick which may be a good thing since there is so little of it but does n't spread through hair very well it left my hair a little crunchy and the crunchiness did n't go away for a few hours when it did dry i felt that my curls just kind of hung there without much body or shine i have used loreal 's professional line prior to this and i will definitely go back to it it 's cheaper better quality and twice the size of luscious curls	23
1	most people i know who have viewed this film fall into two categories on one side there are those who hate it while on the other are those who like it i am of the latter group this is not a comedy although one gets the feeling that with so many absurdities in the lives of the characters that make us laugh it appears to be a comedy however make no mistake about it this brilliant film is more than that it is a biting satire of a very dark side of life one i would n't wish on anyone i did n't know what to make of this film when i first viewed it and i knew it was darker than a dark comedy surely the director was making another statement in this film \? and maybe he was the dysfunctional life of vanessa \( reese witherspoon \) and the even more dysfunctional life of the sociopathic bob wolverton \( keifer sutherland \) converge in one hell of a nightmare this satire on the life of vanessa as a modern day little red riding hood meeting bob the big bad wolf while on her way to grandma 's house was like a punch in the face when i first saw this film i did n't think of it as a comedy as many do but actually a sad commentary on one part of american society this film hits you in the gut even though some parts of the film are funny the disturbing parts are much more powerful highly recommended	23
0	i bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister the skates are good overall they are easy enough to put on and take off the padding inside is nice the only drawback i can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll i am not sure if i just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates i will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting	23
1	looks exactly as the posted picture except the badge reads panasonic not lumix fits the camera perfectly no extra room for memory cards spare battery charger etc it 's easier to insert the camera with both zippers down the belt loop wo n't fit most belts no straps however the camera 's strap is good enough good protection	23
1	my grandparents bought me this for christmas and i really love it ! the doll is absolutely breathtaking and she has honey blond hair with golden highlights her eyes are a deep blue green color and she is very pretty overall the closet she comes with is very cute and i can put barbie shirts and skirts on the little hangers ! there is a lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories i love this toy	23
0	i tried the trick of resizing but honestly the image quality is still abyssmal the images are so low resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out please if you 're thinking of buying this for someone for christmas this year choose something else it might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like this will be a huge disappointment the good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance that 's almost guaranteed so put this one on the must buy for mom list for the 2008 christmas season i very seldom write a review and only wrote this one to keep people from making the same mistake i did	23
1	not sure how i got it but i got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot would n't get rid of on top of that i got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus would n't get rid of so out of desperation to do something quickly i went to b buy and bought this for 40 they did n't have a large selection so i put down the money for it imagine my feeling when i saw it on amazon for 20 still this product works well it made me uninstall spybot adaware and turn off my windows firewall to install it you can install it on 3 different computers or it asked you to switch your license from one of them should you install it a fourth time so you can install it more than 3 times you jsut have to switch your lisenses understand \? product works very well and got rid of my problems you get updates for 1 year and then you have to renew i think this is stupid personally but its the trend now days its a rip you pay 40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what i want it to do i wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it the firewall slows down your connection but they all do i have 3mg dsl and my speed test are down around 1300k so i 've lost alot of bandwith i guess its worth the protection before with spybot and adaware the spyscans would typically find 25 issues of spyware now with trend micro i find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan so i'm happy with the product except for my decrease in dsl speed	23
1	great if you need more mags get this it fits perfect it is exactly what it says it is	23
0	people buy fast food they know its bad for them people pay the geek squad 229 to do 5 minutes of work people also pay 10 bucks for words techno beats called pop music amazing if you had this much money go get a gym membership pay off your cars donate it to children 's hospital why support some teen that in 2 years will die from the music scence and laugh in her mansion	23
0	do not order this item if you want a dvd player with a 5 inch screen this item is not as pictured you will receive a small orange colored player with a 3 5 inch screen	23
0	i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew the versitility of this one looks great well i liked it more than either one of my children did as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom ! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that it just got taken apart and lost its interest no matter which way i arranged the peices infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads	23
1	product arrived when it was supposed and exactly as in the ad i'm glad i ordered item	23
1	there are no professionals or would be professional photographers in our house instead we are ametuers who love to get fun shots of our friends and family we 're not particularly interested in birds flowers bugs race cars etc we want to catch our kids doing what they love best football basketball swimming band golf my only advantage is that i am very experienced with adobe photoshop which lets me creatively salvage some less than perfect shots this year our son is a high school senior instead of buying an expensive portrait package we voted to spend the money on a canon digital rebel xt kit \( with lens \) we choose one extra zoom lense \( the 75 300mm f4 5 6 iii usm telephoto \) for up close action sports shots we did n't chose the is lens because it was out of our price range we are having great fun with this camera and lens we have already taken a variety of football game pictures using the 'basic' sports setting on the camera \( burst mode at full zoom \) they are great crisp and clear these have been taken in full sun we realize that we 'll have to get a little more creative when we are taking pictures in lower light situations but i think we can do it i would recommend this lens for anyone who just wants to capture some fun shots they might not be professional quality but they are just what we wanted	23
1	this has been the best investment i 've made for quite some time after experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit hawaii last year and having my computer die i invested into this unit i read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken i thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so i'm going to try it and see sure enough this unit came with no problems i plugged it in and let it charge over night i then added my computer and my monitor to it i 've seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and i'm so thankful that it has saved my computer if anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers i fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge	23
0	beware this unit does not work with toshiba laptops tech support is non existent you will never get through on the phone email support is non existent you will have to wait weeks to hear back if it does work with your laptop this unit does a great job of recording and playing	23
1	i love earthbound mini carrots they taste sweet and you do n't find dried out pieces in bag like in some other companies i eat them out of the bag as a snack i boil these and mash them with potatoes and use the water in soups and various dishes on the downside mini carrots which are young carrots are abruptly pulled out of the ground by their hair the carrots' skin is then peeled off and stuffed in a plastic bag while still living then they are eaten alive or boiled alive and the're babies ! ! ! yes little carrots are babies and we eat them it 's cruel world if your a carrot	23
1	gene watson 's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for sonny james ernest tubb and dottie west i had never heard of him but then when i heard his voice on the cd i knew the songs it 's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should every song is great but the one which i really like is quot the old man and his horn quot this was a song i had never heard it also shows the versatility of gene 's song selections he has the best voice of any country singer i have ever heard	23
0	dsc series camera all have a ccd imager defect that will leave screen blank after you use the camera for 2 or 3 years \( do a google search you will find out what happened \) sony knew this problem years ago but refuse to fix it they will wait until the camera fail and then charge you 300 to fix it that 's what happens to my dsc f717 ever wondering why dell hp etc all recall sony battery for laptop but sony did not recall their own laptop battery \? sony will never fix their own problem we the customer have to pay for their mistake	23
1	i really like this case ! it is easy to put on and take off it does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen it does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and i think it makes my phone easier to hold i would like for more colors i would really like for something to glow in the dark so that i could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse	23
0	i bought this ear plugs are uncomfortable my ears hurt and in the first use just fall down i just prefered the ones who are made of pvc are better	23
0	rather than this sling i recommend you check out for your sling they are hand made based on your body size and come in a variety of colors this is a far better buy than the native baby carrier	23
1	most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere having lived in washington i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all ca n't live in the pacific northwest i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice but i do wish bh g would take that into consideration otherwise i love this magazine i used to get several magazines but this was always my favorite it is chock full of ideas that we can really use and i love the photography what sets bh g apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses slippers on the floor newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable i would say get this magazine right away i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing	23
0	i have owned the bed and it is very dangerous for a child i am stunned that this product is still on the market while it is very cute and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for my daughter loved the look of this her first big girl bed that was until it fell to pieces with her in it ! the metal rails that are to hold the bed together and the matress in place are not properly planned out if you can even manage to get this bed built which is difficult much more so than it seems at first the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed it is flimsy poorly designed dissapointing and dangerous delta should be ashamed	23
0	the padding is too bulky toward the knuckels there is no padding on the fingers the gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves	23

0	i could n't read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter your wives are your fields so go to your fields as you like is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i'm not going to finish this book because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic oppressed other type of woman thanks	23
1	in spite of some of the poor reviews for this product it met all of my expectations 100 thanks to the reviews i understood that the unit does n't have a builtin antenna or batteries which was helpful to know in advance but of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place i was looking for a small tv to fit in the corner of my bathroom and this unit is perfect for that as a bonus i can not only watch the news while i'm getting ready for work in the morning but i can listen to mp3 rips when i'm in the shower i 've owned the unit for several weeks now use it every day and have never had a problem playing any disk either copy protected movies or cds my only concern so far has been that i did n't receive a warrantee card with the unit i especially like the portability it 's so easy to pick up and take anywhere such as watching a movie in bed and even outside \( if it 's not too bright out \) for watching sports on the patio the speakers are adequate considering their size and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if i want better quality in summary i have to repeat that my expectations were set before i bought the unit and i am very pleased with what i got for the price	23
1	i took my unit to a monthly meeting for seniors their machine broke i took mine as a replacement they liked it so well they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings they like all the different aspects of the machine a suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet write down the date the numbers from the machine \?	23
1	i have this memory card and nyko 's version of the same thing and this one is much more reliable i 've had it filled up nearly to the top with 950 blocks used out of the 1019 avaliable and it never lost or corrupted any of the data great for madden football owners since it takes like 165 blocks of memory to save a franchise	23
1	this is really a great item very comfortable i would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose great for the intended purpose though	23
0	i normally bbq 8 9 racks of ribs at once for our annual party thought that this weber rib rack would make it easier however i found that it was more of a hinderance than a help i like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce several times so i have to remove them from the rack for basting getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain if you 're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook then it might be useful but that 's not me so i gave my weber rib rack to my brother in law	23
0	our 4 month old loved this toy at first but we have had to replace the batteries so frequently that in the end it did n't work more than it did runs through batteries much too quickly also unable to start it from the remote control so we had to reach over the carseat and push the button to begin but now it is in the trash because i touched the straps holding it up and they disintegrated into blue dust not very safe very disappointed	23
1	i was in the travel industry for years and found cn to be an excellent albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations and all other aspects of travel whether upscale or backpack yes it is not encyclopaedic and yes it is chock full of adverts however the latter brings the cost of publication no doubt and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue their travel product ratings are next to none and shortlists the selection process allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions	23
0	this product is a box o' junk my son got this for christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it the hat fell apart within three days \( and he hardly played with it just wore it on his head a few times \) the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat which is obviously dangerous i contacted the company and they have not responded	23
1	for a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used i found h2o plus to be amazing stuff non greasy no heavy scents it 's worth every penny	23
1	just returned from a trip to hawaii and had the opportunity to put this lens to the test i was very pleased with the results this is a powerful lens yet it is relatively light weight and not burdensome to use i was able to get some really amazing wild life shots of birds zooming in from a distance with a hand held camera \( canon eos 20d \) and virtually every shot was a keeper the is feature allows you to quickly zoom and compose your shot and fire it off and the image quality is excellent with sharp focus usually a lens this size with this much power requires a firm grip and almost always a tripod not so with this one i shot in both portrait and landscape mode and i did n't see any problems with focus clarity or sharpness all the images were clean and razor sharp if you are looking for a long lens with the ability to bring in a distant shot without having to use tripods and other equipment i highly recommend this lens for your arsenal	23
1	this magazine is devoted to american inventions and technology that have affected our lives in essence this magazine is a historical magazine about american technology within each issue are multiple articles about a historical invention the articles can either focus on the technology or focus on an individual who has been a key contributor to the advancement of that technology typically each issue also has an interview with an inventor or inventors whose contributions have materially affected our lives or society the scope of the magazine is broad there have been articles on the trans canada highway another recent issue had an excellent article on tunnel boring machines in yet another article the development of refinery cracking was described in the context of the development of higher performance engines the contribution of high octane gasoline to the winning of the air war was mentioned an interesting piece of trivia of which i was previously unaware the scope of the magazine is beyond the physical sciences biology and the development of medical technology are also covered while the magazine is written at a level that an educated non expert can understand some of the biology related articles challenge my attention this magazine is an excellent source of technological history however while the technical jargon used is that appropriate to a technology this magazine is not light reading for those unfamiliar with a specific field as an example i had to read portions of the article on refinery cracking a couple of times to understand the general description of how the cracking process works therefore while i highly recommend this magazine to anyone with an interest in the history of technology realize that for some readers for example elementary school students this magazine could present a reading challenge most articles also provide pictures or other artwork frequently this artwork is unavailable from any other magazine source because there are so few magazines that deal with technological history the quality of the images varies because many of the pictures have not been well preserved but in many cases they are the only pictures available this magazine frequently mentions the inventor 's hall of fame in akron ohio which is sponsored by the united states patent trademark office a number of articles have covered inductees to the inventor 's hall of fame showing that while the articles are historical in nature they are also currently relevant there are a large number of magazines that are either about technology or have had articles about technology there are a large number of trade magazines that cover technology sometimes these magazines even have articles about the history of an invention however the american heritage of invention technology is the only magazine of which i am aware the covers the history of invention and technology while the focus of the articles is american technology it is inevitable that the relationship of foreign invention is covered occasionally as well when that technology was important in the development of american technology i consider this magazine to be excellent for anyone with an interest in historical technology and is an excellent complement to other historical magazines	23

1	not being a fan of westerns i figured i would watch ten minutes of this movie and move on the opening scene completely sucked me in though and the movie took off from there the movie opens with eastwood being lynched by a band of nine men who incorrectly believed he had stolen their friend 's cattle eastwood is left to die only rescued by a marshal who takes him to jail where his story is verified by the judge and eastwood gets a job as a marshal his intention of course is to bring the nine men tried to take his life to justice the action in the movie consists of eastwood kicking some major lawbreaker butt all while looking ruggedly handsome with a trademark glare the movie even manages to touch on moral issues when eastwood wants clemency for an outlaw who helped him out but is denied by the judge the judge himself grapples with issues of having the ultimate power of law over the territory not knowing the right action and wishing for statehood so that he would n't have the power of god over criminals the low point of the movie was eastwood 's romance with a beautiful emotionally scarred blonde woman there is a painfully slow picnic and lovemaking scene which drags on while the audience wants eastwood to get back to his mission of rounding up outlaws other than that the movie is excellent	23

0	to get hot lather which is nice you first have to get the device installed on top the can i would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated the directions provided are sparse in several languages first you have to pry the top off the can of shaving cream they provide a pry tool for that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream better than others then you have to fit the device on top the can it worked well with one brand in a large size can when i tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half the can during the installation process using a different brand in a large can i had trouble prying the top off the can if you have time and patience and are willing to spend some money on various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well give it a try otherwise be forewarned it may lead to frustration and bad language it would be nice if companies intending to sell products in the us \( apparently manufactured somewhere in asia \) would provide a clear set of instuctions in english in reasonable large readable type with illustrations in this case they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for i do not need instructions in foreign languages and get tired of limited instructions in six languages	23

1	these are truly good gluten free cookies we have recently made the switch over to a casein free \( milk free \) gluten free diet for the sake of my son he is already a picky eater so i was worried about the transition these cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served \( ie in church school etc \) he is particularly enamored with them because they have kid friendly animal imprints being gluten free they do tend to break more which can be upsetting for young kids but they taste so good he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces	23
0	i was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood given that the cost is about 10 of the cost of the lens for which it was intended \( the 70 300 is in this case \) i expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate positives fulfills the basic function of a lens hood prevents flare etc the bayonet locking system is excellent much easier to deal with than scew on type lens hoods that 's about it negatives the polycarbonate is so thin i half expect it to be translucent the hood must be gripped by the base to remove it as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it or at least it feels like it may break it its very long especially on the 70 300 which is already a long lens this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long that 's pretty conspicuous it 's very overpriced vs generic lenses \( 50 vs 5 10 for rubber or metal \) i traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood 2 stars for the great bayonet design but the rest of it is weak	23
1	most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere having lived in washington i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all ca n't live in the pacific northwest i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice but i do wish bh g would take that into consideration otherwise i love this magazine i used to get several magazines but this was always my favorite it is chock full of ideas that we can really use and i love the photography what sets bh g apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses slippers on the floor newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable i would say get this magazine right away i would have given it 5 stars except for the whole garden thing	23
0	self what \? the entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page their product placements went from convenient and subtle to obviously pandering to their revenue sources plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain could n't relate i once enjoyed self and their monthly self help plans their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing	23
0	now i am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day yesterday morning i was driving to the dentist 's office when i realized that i had forgotten to eat i started to have quite an anxiety attack so i pulled over at the only available place a gas station nothing really caught my eye as something i would like to put inside my body now this was no ordinary gas station this was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter including supreme pizza chicken drum sticks and even breakfast style food like a little sausage egg buiscuit combo sandwich sure the food smelled alright but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas pumpers may have had oil grease or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes while i was peering over the counter trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were something to my left caught my eye it was a golden box of something called a powerbar the name had me sold immediately \( a food that creates power \) and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them i'm going to eat a powerbar was the only thought on my mind as i purchased 4 of them on the spot i hopped back in my vw cabrio and sped off down livernois towards the dentist 's office i unwrapped one of the powerbars it looked just like a normal candy bar but the name told a different story just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide and for how long \? what kind of advantages would i gain \? i thought i had found my new favorite food finally a food that defines howard tuttleman as a person that is until i took my first bite my first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat it was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor with an atrocious after taste my mouth felt like i had ingested a whole bottle of elmer 's glue and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it i reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar my stomach began to feel as if i had eaten lead i felt no extra power in my body if anything the powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill i was convinced that i had simply picked a bad powerbar so i unwrapped another one to give it a second chance by this time i was in the dentist 's parking lot if i went in now i could make the appointment on time but i had to try for more power big mistake the second powerbar was no different it felt like the powerbars were fighting my stomach i finished the second powerbar feeling even worse my third powerbar however was the worst of the bunch it was a different flavor and i nearly threw up i felt 20 pounds heavier my teeth and lips felt like i had been eating drywall and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget i simply could not eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one no matter how much i tried it was time to go inside my dentist was a little ticked off that i was late and got really annoyed about all of the powerbar remains stuck in my teeth apparently i was n't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment i felt sick for the rest of the day i gave my dog \( morris \) the rest of the 4th powerbar to see if it would work on a dog but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after please beware the name of this product is deceptive unless it is supposed to mean that the powerbar itself is powerful and will overpower you later howardtuttleman co	23
1	i had been hearing always thinking of you but i never got who it was i purchased xm radio and on the smooth jazz channel i heard the cut again and got the artist name purchased the cd based on that one cut every cut is great on this cd i look forward to catching him live at some point and will continue to look for more from him in the future he has his own style but not only do you hear hints of benson and brown i hear a little doc powell as well i will be introducing friends to this great artist keep it coming	23
1	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	23
0	i bought a sight from airsplat for my son 's airoft rifle as a christmas gift the screws were too short to attach it to his kitty kat \( a shortened m 4 \) airsoft rifle 's weaver rail yes i could go out and find screws the proper length but i though i 'd make airsplat do their job so after several e mails with the service department they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size wrong the diameter of the new screws is so big they wo n't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws why by a gun from these guys \? if it arrives broken you pay to ship it back want a refund \? you pay a 15 restocking fee take a pass on airsplat	23
0	for the price this product should receive the cruciatus curse ad infinitum the material is all synthetic \( i was expecting a wool blend though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of \) the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing i dislike being taken advantage of just so i can make my daughter happy she is disappointed as well it was a lot of money to pay to get the hogwarts crest on a patch that was n't even fully embroidered j k rowling should be upset that english woolens with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people	23
1	great product good value maybe a little slow for focusing compared to my old 18 55mm canon lens good quality pictures great all in one lens	23
1	we have had a set of eight of these in sea mist and have used them for morning coffee for several years they will sit on fiestaware saucers just fine i have never burned myself with the handle as mentioned below but tend to hold it with two hands or with the saucer together not just by the handle fiestaware is very sturdy and even if the handle were larger might feel heavy in one hand \( they are made like hotel china essentially homer laughlin is a hotel china company in fact the first set of dishes i had from them decades ago were some of their hotel line \) for a bigger cup for cafe au lait style i can recommend the fiestaware jumbo cups we have a set of those in sea mist and use them for coffee but also for heating soup in the microwave they are both great never been disappointed with fiestaware	23

0	up to you but i would buy a generic branded battery of the same type \( lithium bp522 \) i bought a generic battery and it works just as well saved me 50	23
1	i bought this set after the recent issues with teflon i did my research on all non teflon items and decided upon iron cast pans as the aluminum pans do give off some aluminum into the food and may \( key word here is may \) contribute to alzheimer 's \( according to some \) and the stainless steel gives off chromium and nickel into the foods both of which i am allergic too pure copper with no aluminum is extremely expensive a good set of a few items are 600 there are also ceramic glass pots and pants made by corning pyrex called visionware \( also known as visions \) that can be found on ebay \( and a few are left here on amazon \) as they are no longer in production finally there are also items made of ceramics and clay that should be safe alternativesthe items have been great so far however you will really want to do some research in google \( or any other search engine \) on how to care for them as there are some things that you really should n't do such as rinse a very hot pan in cold water \( it will crack or break \) etc in addition you will also want to so some research on how to season them which makes them very close to being non stick \( you basically smear them with an oil than can take high temperatures and bake the pans for an hour at 350 degrees fahrenheit \) i did this and i just made eggs from eggbeaters without any oil which always used to stick in my nonstick teflon pan but very little stuck in my seasoned cast iron pan the downsides are that the handle can get hot when it is left on the stove for long period of time and that you cannot stick the pan into the dishwasher \( and i tried it will come out a little bit rustier but the little rust does come off very easily \) the sizes are also a little bit on the smaller side for me so i think i will buy one more in a larger size the upsides are price no chemicals \( except for some iron \) in your food easy to care for and very non stick when seasoned this is a great starter set	23
0	are you serious \? i bought this a while ago to see if it was cool it is a piece of junk u can barely get any channels and even if you do you can barely see them and it has loud static dont buy it its garbage	23
0	i received this swing as a gift i really liked that it was more of a cradle swing that the tray was removable \( in fact i never even put it on and it was great \) and the fact that it swings side to side like a crade or front and back like a normal swing my baby loved it the music the mobile etc in the early months it was the only place that she would sleep without me so i loved the few moments of sanity that it gave me what i did n't like about it was 1 it uses a zillion batteries if you use the mobile regularly and 2 the speed control was pretty stupid i thought since all the speeds were the same no matter which setting you have the swing on but if you can live with these complaints then this is an awesome swing	23

1	i bought seven beans for seven dollars and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality they did n't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for that is not to say that the inside of the bean is n't aromatic after all it 's the guts that really count even though these beans do n't seem to be as aromatic as other beans this is still a killer deal ! ! ! i recently purchased one bean from a popular brand spice islands for seven dollars an unbelievably aromatic bean but seven times the cost of these beans ! \? ! \? ! \? i think i 'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans i'm still making away like a bandit	23
1	as with many of the for dummies series controlling cholesterol is a well executed overview of many issues relevant to cholesterol author carol rinzler 's light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why target values for cholesterol can differ in different people there 's an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like atkins' sugar busters and protein power pluses and minuses of each ten cholesterol myths in chapter 16 is a great discussion that can help clear up much of the murkiness surrounding cholesterol issues and can help answer many of the questions that i am asked when treating cholesterol in my patients \( in my cardiology practice \) one criticism like all books about cholesterol controlling cholesterol for dummies gives the reader the impression that high cholesterol is the only way to identify risk for heart disease as well as a means of diminishing risk of heart attack this is patently untrue but not really a criticism of this book as it is of the standard thinking on cholesterol there are better ways ! nonetheless this book does serve its intended purpose very well educate the reader thoroughly on the conventional understanding of cholesterol	23
1	i was a little skeptical about this program until i tried it last evening for the first time i am really impressed i did not even use the tutorial before i dove in and tried to play a bit i created a single room in less than 3 minutes using simple walls doors windows and a fireplace adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful ! loli am most anxious to do more with the program and learn about all its capabilities today i watched the tutorial and was really surprised at how much this program can do ! i am entering into an interior design program in january 06 and wanted to play with the cad software in advance i was really happy and impressed with the simplicity of the better homes and gardens version as the idea of cad seemed intimidating not any more i whole heartedly recommend this program to everyone who is considering designing their interiors or for students of interior design who have not yet attempted any cad programs	23
1	the new balance 991 gl \( and 991 and 990 before it \) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use \( even some cross training \) i have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support wear well and are well ventilated the 991 gl carries on that tradition hopefully the 992 will be just as good	23
1	the magazine has great quality pictures and some interesting articles the pictures of some golf courses are amazing and very professional i love reading this magazine in my spare time yes the magazine is for golfers who always tended to have higher incomes golf was always an expensive sport anyway for golf instructions i recommmend the ulimate golf instruction guide key techniques for becoming a zero handicap golfer or better this is written by patrick leonardii wanted to share with other readers because this book made my golf game get much better if you are like me i was stuck around the same handicap however this book got me playing much better golf for golf equipment i definitely recommmend ping irons great feel and distance with these clubs for putters i also recommend ping they are the best the ball putts straight and true the feel is natural and unforced	23
1	if you 're expecting egg pasta made from the finest durum wheat you 'll be disappointed but if you 're a fan of japanese sukiyaki stir fry udon and chow fun these low carb subs will be right up your alley also and excellent sub for pad thai dishes if the texture does n't bother you then go ahead and try it with your favorite western style dishes shirataki \( shredded konjac \) really has no flavor itself but like tofu it absorbs flavors extremely well in addition to being low in calories and carbs it 's very good for your digestive system ! eat up	23

0	i thought this product had reasonably good taste but i have two major issues with it first they describe this as a kettle corn it is not kettle corn not even close this is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating real kettle corn is a slightly sweet slightly salty popcorn second each very small bag has 1 5 servings in it when was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2 3 's of it \? they purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier the whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion remember when a can of coke had 1 5 servings in it \? the fda made them change the label if you eat the whole bag you are eating 200 calories of popcorn no better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies so this is not a lesser evil it 's just the same old junk food with a new name i wo n't buy this product again it 's the same stuff you can get anywhere	23
0	while the pedal exerciser mechanically works fine the plastic or something on it smells so bad it is not pleasant to keep inside i have had it for several weeks now and it has not gotten better i called their customer hotline and was told they know about it but do n't have any solutions i asked if they had a website i could check periodically to see if they had come up with something and was told to call back in 2 3 months right	23

0	i was very excited to hear that this new muppets holiday offering was coming ! the previous two christmas albums \( a christmas together w john denver a muppet christmas carol \) have long been family favorites at hour house in december however this time i am disappointed most of the songs performed on this cd include voices not done by the original puppeteers that made them famous i realize it is impossible to perfectly duplicate the voices to match the puppeteers that are no longer with us but to focus on these voices so much \( kermit rowlf dr teeth statler waldorf the swedish chef \) in this album only produces a disappointing reminder that the muppets we grew up with are long gone maybe i am being a little hard on this cd but there are plenty of muppets they could have focused on for this project that are still performed in the original voices \( robin sam honeydew beaker rizzo louzeland etc \) those voices added to those of ganzo miss piggy and fozzie would have made for a more familiar feel there are a couple of good cuts on the album one is merry christmas by pepe the other is santa baby by miss piggy sadly over all i can not recommend this cd	23
1	a film that 's a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism since nothing is as it seems we may as well be inside a fictionalized world like the unicorn story the main character cathryn is writing this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination however the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem \( hugh is played by rene rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn \) insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance	23
0	the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them and i could not get the hooks to work i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it and it failed far short of the maximum weight on the package in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures which i had to hang with other hardware	23

1	i first saw the b w original of the thing in the late 50s \( \? \) and was totally engrossed \( jumped out of my seat with the rest of the audience at one point \) so i knew generally what the plot might be the story line and characters here were pretty much the same dressed up in color and hi tech research equipment nifty vistas of alaska 's bleak beauty and a satisfying high tech rendition of the half uncovered alien saucer the suspense and drama were nonstop and the characters interesting individual and credible it was a relief that the standard beuatiful female scientist \( or alien \) was omitted for a change the thing was believable and suitably gory and menacing even if a little stereotyped \( eg long slavering fangs powerful tentacles bulging eyes and dripping goo \) it and the other special effects were well done and worth the price of admission i wo n't comment on the ending to avoid spoiling it for you other than noting it reminded me of the old folk tale the lady or the tiger engaging entertaing reality escape flick	23

1	the crib tent is great ! we originally got it to keep our cats out but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too \) until at 27 months he learned how to reach through the crib slats undo the zipper ! ! ! ! o so now we 're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week ! it is hard to change sheets with the crib tent but just get the ultimate crib sheet it 's a piece of cake ! \) also it is possible to put down the side rail of the crib but this does lower the tent too can bop you in the head	23
0	these shoes are not as cute as they appear the heel is really 2 5 the material is cheap the fit is too wide the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in etc etc etc on a positive note it 's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress be warned the company claims that all their shoes have 2 heels when they do n't and they charge tax on shipping charges	23

0	i am still giving this camera 2 stars because i may have used the wrong settings when taking photo 's but i ended up with a lot of blurred and fuzzy photo 's example when we went bowling almost every photo was blurred or had those acid trip looking streaks my biggest complaint is the battery door broke completely in half in less then 4 months of use you might expect that out of a 30 dollar camera but not a 3 hundred dollar one i paid 284 99 for the camera 47 99 for the 1 gb sd memory card and 51 54 for the docking station and that did n't include s h or taxes they were extra ! my husband replaced this one for me with the kodak easyshare c743 and g600 printer dock and it 's a 7 1 mp and it takes better quality pictures that i can print home for less then this one \( 249 95 w free shipping handling and 1 gb sd memory card included \) from k o d a k online	23

0	we bought this at suggestion of our dentist however it is difficult to use extremely messy and the on off button on handle is difficult to press we used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience our neighbors bought the same model tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave save your money and go back to flossing !	23
0	initially i was going to order several items from andrew christian until i saw their shipping prices at checkout 2 shipping on each 4 tee shirt was more than excessive they were going to charge me 20 shipping on a 42 order ! i canceled most of the items only ordering a belt and a tee shipping was still 50 surcharge received my order yesterday and found that the belt is defective the buckle is on backwards \( no it 's not reversible \) plus the material of the belt itself is damaged by a frayed hole it is n't worth the shipping cost hassle to send it back i 'll probably just throw it away but i did learn something i will never deal with andrew christian again ! i you choose to please pay attention to the shipping charges when you check out you may decide to revise your order	23
1	i 've been a subscriber since right before the days of bel ami i 've never regretted a single issue nor the investment	23
1	one of the things i like about this book for young readers is that the same vocabulary words are repeated throughout the series so that the kids can build on what they learned in one book while they 're reading the next at first i was disappointed with the series since i did n't think it did justice to the little house series that i treasured myself as a girl after a few reads however i see that the magic of laura ingalls wilder 's stories shines through in this series with renee graef 's illustrations how else do you explain to a four year old what a log cabin is really like \? i am surprised how many how and why questions this series has provoked regarding this book in particular my daughter asked about a million questions about the maple syrup making process	23
0	i ordered this television with high hopes knowing that despite reports of firmware problems and other defects that i would luck out and save a bundle but you get what you pay for every sharp aquos lcd tv manufactured before april 1 2006 shipped with bad firmware what does this mean to you \? for me it meant that 15 minutes after unpacking the tv and turning it on it turned itself off and never turned back on again resets system resets power cycling unplugging components did n't help my tv was completely bricked a search turned up threads on websites like avs forum with other owners of sharp tvs in the d4u and d6u series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase for them the fix was a visit to a sharp authorized service center to either have the firmware replaced or a physical replacement of boards inside the tv i say a visit because sharp does not cover in house technician visits for tvs under 32 a fact they could have informed me of before letting me wait 1 week for a tech visit that would ultimately be canceled so here i am 10 days later and hundreds of dollars poorer with no tv to show for it instead it sits at the authorized service center \( because sharp obviously does not vet its service centers to make sure you get good service from them either \) i'm willing to bet all of the inventory of d6us that tigerdirect is selling at fire sale prices were produced before 4 1 2006 check the serial number on your tv if you do order one if it begins with a 501 512 601 602 or 603 immediately demand a firmware upgrade from sharp \( 1 800 be sharp \) regardless of whether or not you 're experiencing these issues you will eventually and hopefully while sharp 's warranty is still in effect for you	23
1	this mug absolutely comes through as promised hot beverages stay hot even hours later it 's totally leak proof and easy to disassemble for cleaning i am very pleased with this purchase ! the only thing that i am not completely satisfied with is it 's size i would have preferred something a little wider but the ability to fit in any drink holder is what the manufacturer was going for unfortunately it tends to move around in mine but it does n't spill any thing	23
0	the ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time i put it in the freezer ! evidently the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed ! in addition to that my soup was luke warm at lunchtime	23

0	if you are going to lay out 500 for a camera you should expect a fair amount of camera however i have a few gripes here first there is no remote control for it which makes setting up a shot tough all the nikons in the d series can use a wireless remote you can buy an underwater case for those magnificent nikons so you can shoot underwater you can get over 10 megapixels in a d80 or d200 and you get that great nikkor lens you do n't get much of a lens on the dc500 and 5 megapixels do n't get you very far when it comes to printing and publication quality images lets face it this is an expensive point n shoot camera for a tourist not a serious camera nuff said	23
0	the fine print on the box tells you this is a multi terrain vehicle instead of an all terrain vehicle this is because while they advertise it to go through sand and grass and mud what they actually mean is that it will go through dry sand such as you would find in a desert dry grass such as you would find on the african savannah and dry mud such as you would find in their fertile imagination mine has shorted out and stopped working just going through dewey grass	23
0	the item in this picture is not the item i received when you buy from a picture make sure you are prepared to be disappointed the frame of the stand is very thin not wide as shown screws are seen that attach to the stand the bottom of the bowl is seen also the bowl has concrete as filler with a complete circle of bowl looks cheap the colors are washed out the bird and flower also not vibrant as shown this item came with nothing from mfg no instuctions on anything or who they are it was well wrapped and the package was ruined in removing apparently this was planned i was told i could send it back free of charge what am i going to send it in \? good old amazon offered me 20 off to keep it this is apparently their standard screw up fee not my first experience the item i received is not an 80 item or a 64 item it is in my yard it will remind me where not to buy things in the future beware ! ! ! !	23

0	i bought this item about 6 months ago after 2 months the handle fell off on phoning the company they said plastic parts were only guaranteed for 1 month hence they would not replace it after another 2 months the unit stopped working altogether i then got in touch with the company and managed to speak to a very rude customer service representative who said i would have to send it to the company and pay for shipping and handling myself yet it says in the handbook that the company would pay for the shipping i am truely disappointed with the lack of customer care and the appliance i do believe i have a faulty appliance but the compnay is not at all bothered to keep its customers happy i do not reccomend that anyone buy this item save your money and all the hastle	23

1	i like this printer there a few minor quarks but it 's fast and the prints come out good the one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight if it 's lose it will start making bad prints it takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out tighten it and start printing again i am also using this with the mac osx os though the device says it will only work with pc and mentions something about the casio cw utility for use on a mac but no where on the casio site could i find the mentioned utility after some searching i cam e accross this this allows the cw 100 to work fine on a mac though i have never seen the pc software that comes with printer i have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options this is enough to get around since you can make a jpg version of your label put that in the print area and print away the jpg can be what ever image text you want resolution is great too i print at 300dpi all in all i found this to be a great purchase i make music and do not have the money to send out to have my cds done this print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost great the diyer	23
1	philosophy products have really changed my skin and i know this is true because the times i have run out of philosophy products and replaced them with even very expensive department store brands my skin starts breaking out and looking blotchy uneven and tired then i remember how much philosophy does for me and i absolutely have to reorder if you buff your face with the microdelivery peel wash thoroughly with purity cleanser then follow with this product when hope is not enough serum then hope in a jar moisturizer on your entire face and neck your skin will just glow and you will be amazed how fast blemishes and blotches just go away and do n't come back ! after using the microdelivery peel my skin looks 75 better right away after a week of using all the products my skin is clear and glowing i really believe in these products they feel great smell great and work great	23

0	this version wind and cloud the storm riders made in 2004 is not the same as the storm riders made in 1998 this dvd is a condensed version of a tv series packaged by tai seng it is full screen and was made for tv it is pretty disjointed as it was condensed into 2 hours from 30 hours most people doing the reviews for this dvd is confusing everyone writing positive reviews for the 1998 film staring aaron kwok and ekin chen	23

0	i had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long about six months ! i live on a sailboat and i used it every day maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience the burner did not simmer well \( the flame kept creeping back up \) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died it seems to have a design flaw the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly i called century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be hmmmm i did not think it would last long but i liked it so much that when it died i tried out another one this one was immediately defective and i took it back neither century nor coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more camp chef may be a better though much more expensive choice for a person who does a lot of camping	23

0	every once in a while i like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading and look for a surprise or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out it is with this mindset i picked up would n't take nothing for my journey now and what did i find as a result of my maverick literary exploration \? ehh ms angelou may not take anything for her journey but based on the cover price she will take 17 00 to tell you a bit about it and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided whatever the cause this book is dreadful if you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble gook i e about boundaries respect finding ones direction learning what it means to be a women etc then this journey is for you but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere	23
1	i bought two potties before i realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front i broke down and bought this this does n't have the bells and whistles like some other potty but it 's beauty is its simplicity he is able to sit and do his business carry the urine poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself \( he was not even 2 yet ! \) i would highly recommed the potty training book potty training in less than a day it 's out of print but you might find an used copy on	23
1	all year long my three and a half year old daughter asked for a digital camera for christmas 3 weeks before christmas she sat on santa 's lap at the mall and asked for a trumpet of all things i immediately came home and searched online everyone had the colorful play trumpets that were electronic with diferent characters on them but none of them looked real ! and i'm pretty sure that my daughter was expecting santa to bring a real trumpet so i found this ordered it and it was here before the estimated delivery date ! it is extremely lightweight \( cannot be used as a weapon \) each button has a different tone to it and it looks real \( besides the fact that it 's not brass \) she loved it ! she plays it all the time and unbelievably it 's not the most annoying toy she has i would recommend it to anyone with young children interested in musical instruments	23
0	let me first say that i did not purchase this mini stepper through amazon but rather directly from the discovery channel store two weeks after i submitted my review of their product on their web site however they still have not seen fit to post it i used the discovery electronic mini stepper daily for 29 days \( 30 minutes per day \) before the cable around the pulley wheel broke this seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment judging by previous reviews on the dcs \( discover channel store \) web site being inside the 30 day return window i sent my stepper back for a refund customer service i must say was excellent only the product itself was cheap and substandard on a related note this is the third mini stepper \( various brands not all dcs \) i have owned in the past year they have all broken down in one way or another feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper take some advice from me when i say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness that is to say if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15 20 minutes then you may be satisfied with one however if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine then do n't even consider one of these machines you will destroy it trust me there 's just too much that can go wrong pulleys cracking pulley cables breaking shocks leaking and i actually broke the frame of one stepper through all of this i have learned one important lesson about exercise keep it simple i am now having great success with some simple resistance bands \( many varieties are available here at amazon \) and cardiovascular exercises \( e g regular old jumping jacks \) i get a better workout than any i ever got from a mini stepper and i'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places \) honestly if you want to save yourself some grief please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction just buy yourself some resistance bands maybe a jump rope an exercise mat an instructional video book and then get to work exercising to tone your body and lose weight is n't easy \( and if it is then you 're probably not doing it right \) but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this	23
0	if you are accustomed to using other versions of coreldraw you may not want this version fact is they have made many so called improvements which i find are incompatible with other software that i have used in the past it does not convert to encapsulated postscript \( eps \) files properly and will crash programs that traditionally work well with eps figures by contrast coreldraw 11 worked well hence the improvement has rendered the software a nuisance if you are accustomed to pasting figures into other software forget it coreldraw x3 will not retain the integrity of the original figure and it will look distorted and crummy any prior version of coreldraw worked well again the improvement has made the software a nuisance on top of that it crashes a lot i contacted their customer service about a year ago when i first discovered these differences i was assured that they knew about the problems and were working on them well a year later with no patches to correct these differences i am now being told that it is everyone else 's fault \( software manufacturers \) that coreldraw is not compatible i was also told that they have no intention to correct these problems because they do not consider them problems there is an example of their customer service for you i have been using coreldraw for a long time starting with 6 then 9 then 11 this is the worst of the bunch by far i am going back to a previous version	23
0	i have had this scale for about 4 months it worked fine the few times i used it but last night i went to use it and it has given up the ghost i swapped batteries and still nothing the connection for the 9v battery is very loose and even after crimping and holding it tight it did n't get any juice not happy so i will order a different brand and hope it does better i do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets so maybe i just got a lemon	23
0	i was never much of a chili peppers fan over the years but i thought i 'd give them a chance and listen to this disc and just as i always thought it 's crap very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have i feel like i need a bath after just looking at their picture as far as the music is concerned the singing is awful \( deadpan monotone voice \) the instrumentation is very limited and the overall production is 2nd rate the only plus if any is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material which is still not very good the fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have really bad taste	23

1	you know if anything happens to me you 're in command says sergeant kelly \( thomas mitchell \) to corporal colin spence \( henry fonda \) they 're lost in the libyan desert with only three gallons of petrol left for their remaining armored car almost no water and a busted compass sergeant kelly started out with corporal spence and twelve other men on a routine patrol three german fighters changed things now there 's only sergeant kelly spence and four others nothing 's going to happen to you sergeant spence says i mean it ca n't it wo n't lad if i can help it still if i stop a packet it 's up to you to get this patrol back and that 's not an easy job but i'm no leader spence says i have n't had the experience to take up a command like this with other men 's lives depending on me i can carry out orders but i ca n't give them i'm just a civilian with a couple of chevrons on my sleeve the immortal sergeant tells us the story of colin spence a small town reporter from canada in england who is shy and not really able to accomplish the things he wants please note that while elements of the plot are discussed the key elements are all described on the dvd case it 's obvious valentine \( maureen o'hara \) loves him but he just ca n't seem to recognize the signals just before he enlists she and colin meet an old friend of colin 's at a party benedict \( reginald gardner \) is now a famous war correspondent good old colin i tell you this lad has a head on his shoulders says benedict to valentine i'm afraid he 's a little bit too self effacing for the times though you know like the good old democracies nice but a little bit too civilized for his own good eh colin \? benedict smoothly moves in on valentine and colin can only look on spence keeps remembering valentine while he and the rest of the patrol struggle through the desert now on foot the sergeant leads the men in an attack on an isolated german armored car they hope to find water and perhaps even capture the car and drive back to their own lines the sergeant is clear about what they must do this war like every other war is going to be won by men on their feet with guns in their hands and do n't you forget it he tells them but the car is destroyed in the attack the cans of german water with it and two more men in the patrol die the sergeant is one of them colin spence has no choice but to take command now and slowly as he faces the reality of the situation he becomes more forceful and more resourceful the three other men one a little reluctantly accept his leadership he knows he does n't have the answers he relies on his memory of sergeant kelly and his memory of valentine to keep him moving forward at the climax he leads a desperate attack on an oasis guarded by three times the number of germans it is an attack which is bravely led and fought back in a cairo hospital colin spence sums it up i had to come all the way out here to meet a tough sergeant named kelly who was born in a slum and educated in an army camp before i was fit for a woman like valentine he 's dead now but he taught me one thing if i ever want valentine or anything else worthwhile in life i 've got to fight for it that 's not a bad thing for a man to find out or for a nation either for that matter to fight this is an appealing war time movie with little of the bravado and obvious emotional string pulling of most war movies thomas mitchell gives a fine performance and maureen o'hara would be any man 's dream of the woman waiting back home what takes this movie out of the ordinary is henry fonda did any major hollywood star before or after combine so effectively almost naive honesty decency and acting skill we sympathize with colin spence 's shyness we sympathize with spence 's nervousness at the idea of being in charge if his sergeant is killed we see and approve of spence 's taking on the responsibility of leading the remaining men of the patrol and we come to admire his dedication to do the right thing to fight against the odds for a good cause the immortal sergeant is a film that with time sort of slipped between the cracks dvd has brought it back and it 's worth seeing the dvd transfer is just fine there are no significant extras	23

0	i have found another product that i want to recommend it 's called alert and is sold by consultants like avon but you can also go the starlight website and order it it 's a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters and as a bonus i do n't feel hungry when i'm using it they also have a product specifically for weight loss i have tried that as well i did feel a bit jittery at first but it settled after a week or so of taking it i would recommend it also i used it a few years ago and lost 35 lbs i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings i'm now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need energy and hunger control and it 's less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it i 've used this for years and have not had any problems	23

1	discipleship journal does what many other christian magazines do not do it provides instruction and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ focused faith while others may talk about christianity dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture this is n't an evangelistic magazine like decision or an encouraging magazine per se like moody it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god 's word says it is not for the passive pew sitter this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays there is nothing watered down here it is published by navpress who like their counterparts the college ministry navigators know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian whether it is a discussion about satan 's favorite lies how to study a particular book of the bible or an explanation of what prayer is an is not dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid page and realize something new about our lord and his ways this is a great tool for two or three people to use together even a small group to go through the articles week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life i 've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week 's class i fully recommend discipleship journal expect your faith to grow anthony trendleditor hungarianbookstore co	23

0	i bought these because they matched my dishes i really wish i 'd kept my old ones even though they were black the size of these is nice for flour sugar etc however the rubber seals in them are n't great the seal on my flour \( biggest one \) falls in every single time i take the lid off they 're pretty but not very functional	23
1	vogue used to be my favorite fashion mag out there but today the advertisements are simply ridiculous i think the ad to editorial ratio must by 90 10 it still has wonderful fashion tips but the ads are becoming burdonsome in style has replaced vogue as my 1 fashion mag but i 'll always be a vogue reader	23

0	i watched parts of all the let 's dance salsa dvds and what a joke is this guy serious \? he needs to get a few dvds himself to find out about salsa rhythm lead and following and just general concepts of dancing i agree with a few other folks who wrote reviews what qualifies him as an instructor \? i think he 's doing an injustice to salsa if anyone is considering learning from these dvds do n't you 'll not only learn some bad habits in dancing but you 'll be a joke on the dance floor the only worth these dvds have to anyone interested in salsa is for a good laugh seriously amazon should consider removing this product	23
0	every other negative review here is accurate the video connection is horrible the mouse runs on a delay of 1 2 seconds and is unacceptable try the competing kensington product instead it 's more expensive but it works i switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected	23

1	i 've had this high chair for a year now and i love it my daughter plays with it every day and it 's worn great it still looks as good as the day we put it together i love that it 's wood rather than cheap plastic and it 's a pretty white with pink gingham which i think is adorable the material has held up great and still looks perfect the wood is sturdy with no cracks it fits all my daughter 's dolls including her large cabbage patch doll if i were going to change anything i 'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through \( like real high chairs \) for the most part her babies stay put but sometimes they slip down and out it 's not a big problem though our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter and feel the same way about it we love the badger basket product line ! i highly recommend this product	23

1	i received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised i put it together all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it i have the chicco key fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon there is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller the only reason i did n't give it 5 stars is that it 's a bit heavy bulky i hope i do n't have any problems getting it in and out of my van i ca n't wait to try it out at the mall	23
1	i have this seat for my 4 month old and i love it yes it is larger than your average infant car seat but i have no problems getting it in and out of my car which is a toyota avalon not the smallest car on the market but certainly not the biggest with my daughter who is 5 when she moved to the convertible car seat the biggest downfall was having to wake her up to get out of the car graco has made it so that i no longer have to do this my son is nearly 20lbs already and had i been using your average infant seat i would have to buy him a new one already bravo to graco for making a seat with extra weight height limits another perk is it has the canopy so the sun is n't in his eyes which i also would n't get if he were in a convertible car seat my one and only complaint is that the fabric is n't breathable so my son sweats a lot in this seat but i just put a receiving blanket between him and the seat and he is fine this in itself is n't enough to make me trade this seat for another	23
1	this is a very lemony smell and the sugar takes away the sour 'edge' of the lemon it is simply only that lemon and sugar then it gets warmer and airy throughout the day if you want to just try it get a sample size one from ebay or a mini perfumes website if your considering the more expensive clean fragrance but are n't sure about the price fresh lemon sugar is similar in scent the only thing being left out is the laundry 'air' fragrance	23

0	every lakers fan i 've ever met lives in the past sadly now to them the clock stopped when kareem and magic hung up the shoes and we know why magic had to leave their basketball knowledge from the 60s to the 90s is rewarding after this however they do n't have a clue of what has happened to this once mighty and moral organization the lakers have been a good team over the decades as apparent on this dvd set but the run of greatness is coming to a long slide with kobe driving the bus the lakers were once considered the green bay packers of the nfl but now they 're just lucky to even get close to a playoff spot over a majority of the teams in the western conference which are much better than the present lakers i recently attended a game last fall at the staples center and besides all of the celebs eating hummus in the stands i could barely hear myself think over phil jackson 's mantra i told you so further illustrating how things have changed in la jack nicholson has become embarrassed to wear anything purple or yellow so it is understandable that laker fans would rather focus on the achievements of magic and kareem than rather extol the diminishing skills of kobe since his colorado folly there are some good games on this dvd along with great moments from the baylor chamberlain west days i recommend any laker fan to purchase this dvd set to relive the past so laker fans keep living in the past if you so desire maybe kobe will retire and become a man of the cloth and lead the lakers to the nba championship promised land once again long live the forum or the staple remover center or whatever they are calling the lakers home now	23

0	the card works and produces a reasonable image but the catalyst software used to drive the card is lacking buggy to make work i had to disable the scsi cd burner in the system \( or the software would hang for several minutes before working \) the sofware is slow to open respond beyond that the ability to size the tv window is very limited this card replaced a standard tv card in my system that i bought for 25 i used the old card more because it would open quickly and i could resize the window to be small \( non intrusive \) while i was working on other things on the plus size i can expand the hdtv card to larger windows while retaining a good image	23

0	die hard fans of writer director david cronenberg may find funny dialogue and grotesquely engrossing scenes in this sci fi horror tale that accounts for so many 5 star ratings by other reviewers that was not my reaction to this film it was slow uninteresting and the ending was a disappointment i give it only 2 stars the characters stumble through a virtual role playing game and pretend they are gamers duh cronenberg needs more than ideas for his next film he needs a good script and actors who are more suited for their roles william defoe is completely miscast as a gas station attendant jennifer jason leigh 's wardrobe looks like retro 1980 's jude law does well except for a couple of unexplained accent changes beware of the tag line that says existenz makes the matrix look like child 's play this film is no where near the caliber of the matrix if you are not a cronenberg fan i recommend that you pass on this dull film	23

1	i had a radio flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it which is why i wanted one for my daughter we bought ours when our daughter was a year old and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it now that she 's four she loves pulling her one year old little brother around or posing for pictures with him in it we use it for picnicing in the local park or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn the wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos from the labor day block party to halloween trick or treating it 's a quot classic quot for good reason kids love it and never stop loving it	23
0	if we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the prague spring and street protests in the u s as kurlansky attempts in this book the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year the reader is owed specifics yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent but prohibited it chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government however flawed resulting from open debate a bigger difference could hardly be imagined but kurlansky does see striking differences albeit only in the post 1968 world the soviet bloc began it 's decent to oblivion while the capitalist west avoided the same his disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean though what manner of revolution he envisions is never rendered to specifics likely for good reason but who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do	23
0	this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature it is timely but it is not timeless not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly not one scene is memorable the true nature of the book soap opera is cloaked under its many pages messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story and she seems to have believed her publicity machine i ca n't believe that her husband who a great literary critic would not talk her out of publishing this oh i forgot money and fame trumps quality every time	23

1	i emphasize strategy what you will not find are fancy graphics studio sound arcade action cheats or a killer strategy that will win every time this game is wonderfully balanced with 17 nations \( another in the works \) 1100 units 400 spells 400 magic sites 250 magic items and much more but the neat thing is that they give you what you need to play in your style berserker defensive researcher swarmer sneak diplomatic whatever instead of feeling like you are learning the strategies that the developer had in mind for you to learn you can actually develop your own tactics and surprises there are people who have played it over a year and still come up with new things to try \( and yes its one of those games which will actually survive on your machine for a year	23
0	this book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all you could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did book doesnt show you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them it also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor did n't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses it is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used	23
0	it 's a great concept but my unit was n't recognized by any of my 3 pc 's despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit one of my pcs runs xp \( they had no idea why this computer did n't recognize the magpix \) and the others run win98 \( which they said sometimes has problems with the magpix although they do n't say that in their marketing literature \) they gave me my money back but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised and in addition i wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them i suggest waiting for the next version or even better for a better company to introduce a similar product	23

1	my mother absolutely loves this tea it 's the only kind she will use i received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where i could purchase more and they told me they do n't sell to the public my mom was very upset i then went on to amazon \( which was great for all my christmas shopping \) who put me in touch with bently so my mother had a wonderful christmas ! ! !	23
1	this is one of the nicest electric shavers that i 've owned and the first wet type shaver i have previously owned norelcos for over a decade the original norelcos \( made in holland \) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair ! it is painful ! i eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift and cut norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars bad idea you do n't always get what you pay for ! i was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable gillettes decided to try a wet shaver i took my chance on this one based solely on the reviews here this is the very first wet shaver i 've used and absolutely love it it gives a close enough shave but not too close you can use it with whatever shaving cream you use note that the panasonic manual encourages using the cheapest foam type \( not gel \) barbasol like stuff with this shaver it also comes with a basic carrying pouch and the cleaning is as easy as it can get \( just wash the thing under tap water \) they really meant that this unit is washable it is recharagable lasts seven days on a charge and costs less than replacement blades for competing brands the build quality is excellent the charger is a very clever design that gets the shaver completely off your counter space you cannot go wrong with this amazon has a great value here sometimes you get more than you asked for and this is one of those rare things highly recommended	23
1	this stuff is sooo great this three pack set gives you the creme de la creme in men 's skincare the shampoo is wonderful and actually prevent hair loss the body wash is my favorite its smells awesome the after shave is fantastic soothing and refreshing i suggest this pack for those who 've never used billy jealousy or those loyal followers such as myself this is also a great was for someone to get introduced to billy jealousy this has all the essentials you will not be displeased in fact you 'll be in awe you 'll be compelled to tell everyone this also makes a great gift billy jealousy is the absolute best and i 've used all upscale lines from department stores sephora and spas and this stuff is the best	23

1	this is a wonderful show and very true to the band 's recent live performances albeit with a condensed songlist i give it only 4 stars because i had the pleasure of seeing mr winwood and band live and the sound stage gig seems just a tad below that experience which is admittedly an unfair comparison nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso \( actually a band of virtuosos \) consider it 4 5	23
1	first of all let me say that this is what black tea is suppose to taste like as soon as i took a sip of this tea earlier today i knew that this is one of tazo 's finest tea i'm not going to say that i 've tasted many earl grey teas because the only other earl grey tea i 've tasted is twinings but this tea in my opinion added a twist that was needed for earl grey tea do n't get me wrong earl grey tea is fine the way it is but the scented citrus bergamot added by tazo makes a difference i would enjoy drinking the tea straight up with some sugar but i like to add a little bit of milk to the tea because i'm used to adding milk to black teas i recommend this tea to anyone that is willing to try something new or enjoy earl grey with the tazo twist	23

1	i purchased this for christmas for my 8 year old son to play with it was 329 with free shipping compared to 450 at the local sports store the finished product looks great appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust i only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy and i am mechanically inclined practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous it was a 4 hour assembly with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience but the smile on the 8 year old 's face was well worth the aggravation on a side note i ordered 70 of my christmas shopping from amazon with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date \( everything else shipped ups \) they shipped this via dhl which never delivered the package i had to drive 120 mile round trip to pick it up at the dhl facility and take time off of work the friday before christmas to retrieve my son 's primary gift i emailed amazon requesting 70 credit to reimburse me for my time and gas which they did in a few days this was an oversized package that i assume ups would not accept nonetheless their choice of shippers reflects on amazon as a company	23
1	these earrings are very small maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each they do appear white \( i do n't see any yellow tinting \) with a slight slight bit of grey which i prefer over a super white look \( as you might sometimes find in a cz \) these earrings catch the light nicely showing a bit of rainbow effect they are n't super super sparkly or faceted but they do possess shine and detail i am very happy with these earrings as they are just what i wanted something petite and real set in yellow gold and with a nice clean and believably sparkly look ! i also like the fit of the earrings backs very tight and secure	23
0	i am only giving this product such a low rating because of the shipping the product costs 29 95 and shipping is 22 49 doubling the cost ! this is the product we used to flavor the popcorn in the movie theater i worked in during high school i adore it	23

0	we love this monitor but only when it does not have awful interference unfortunately in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours we do not live in an apartment or townhouse \( which i read was not recommended for this product \) but we do have wireless internet only we are n't using it when there is static so who knows i love being able to see my boy but the static makes the monitor really annoying	23
0	i should have heeded the bad reviews on this site i purchased this as a christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient it was dead on arrival i tried a new battery still dead on arrival both batteries tested ok clearly it 's a dead unit i contacted the new manufacturer \( not pni as advertised \) and am awaiting a response i ca n't recommend this product	23
0	i know that pelican screen protectors and styluses are tempting because they 're always the cheapest ones available that should tell you something first of all the top screen uses adhesive it 's smooth plastic in the middle but the edges will leave sticky goo on the screen because the edge is a different material than the middle it 's insanely difficult to squeeze the air bubbles out of it and being adhesive trying again and again is n't much of an option furthermore the sticky edge is white not clear and it looks horrible on my onyx ds lite after having so much difficulty with the top screen protector i checked online for reviews i read several reports of people who used the pelican styluses with the pelican bottom screen protector and the screen protector being very drastically scratched up within an hour 's worth of use so whether the stylus is too harsh for the bottom screen protector or the screen protector was too flimsy for the stylus the combination just does n't work many people report simply throwing their pelican write and protect sets into the trash so i'm not the only one that paid pelican money for something that 's going into the trash can no matter how inexpensive pelican 's product is it 's still too expensive if you end up throwing it in the trash too i know i'm going to avoid the pelican screen protectors and styluses in the future and i very much wish that there were reviews here on amazon before i bought mine i had to dig through nintendo ds forums to read other peoples' opinions finally if you already bought one and hate it you can remove it by using scotch tape on the edges to peel it off and rubbing alcohol to remove the residue	23

0	i'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is there 's nothing wrong with celebrity mags but this one has pretensions of so much more when essentially it 's about as deep as an e ! true hollywood story about kato kaelin i 've tried many times but alas this one is sadly not worth the tree destroyed to print it	23

1	if you 're considering the viamichelin \( under 200 gps \) you 're probably trying to decide if a gps that is more than 100 cheaper \( much more than 100 in some cases \) than its competitors is really any good honestly i would have been skeptical too however a relative bought one of these units and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before i decided to purchase one myself my brief summary is that yes this unit is a good gps and a great value after using mine on a trip i 'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine background my gps experience is limited to a 7 year old garmin iii plus i had to plan detailed trips on my pc using mapsource then upload the waypoints and routes to the gps it could be a time consuming process and because the unit was n't necessarily user friendly my wife never learned how to use it enter the viamichelin we just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit set up time for the trip was about a minute all i had to do was program in the street address of our destination now for the rundown first what it does n't do well a \) using it for the past two weeks \( as a test only \) around my home town i was a little disappointed it never sent me the wrong way but it did n't always take the best route some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area and in some cases old logging roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route although this was disconcerting at first i do n't think it is a big deal as you 'll see later b \) macro directions i e for a several hundred mile trip it will get you there and if you 're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns this would be a good device if you are n't familiar with the route but my route this weekend was very simple get to the interstate and drive it did n't pick my preferred route to the interstate and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate \( although it did recover and finally suggest my route as i stubbornly drove my way \) so for a major trip i 'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route use this device if you have a lot of mind numbing turn by turn now what it does well a \) voice prompts are great it does n't matter that it does n't say the street names turn right in 300 feet is good enough especially with the map that you can glance at b \) it did great around my destination towns of charlotte nc gastonia nc and rock hill sc did it take the best route as i drove from soccer fields to hotels to restaurants \? i do n't know since i was n't familiar with the areas but the routes seems to be just fine they got me exactly where i needed to go and i never had to look at a road map and after all this was the main reason i needed a newer gps it passed this with flying colors c \) my wife did some of the set up while in the car she 'll be using this one on her on very soon d \) we wanted to find a particular restaurant but did n't have the street address the restaurant was in the points of interest database and it took us right to it also finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great i also found a feature that was not listed in the 89 page manual from the navigation map if you touch the screen it has a bypass route option it will give you some distant options \( 1 mi 5 mi etc \) then it will find a bypass route for you so if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam this will route you off the interstate take you up the road and bring you back on obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving but then it 's going to try to turn you around and or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer the bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out in the future i would like to do a side by side comparison w a more expensive \( borrowed \) gps also after more experience i 'd like to update this review bottom line i am glad i bought this unit i cannot imagine spending 100 500 more on a more expensive model though the higher priced models may have better features the value for the extra money just is n't there for me	23
1	the watch is very pretty sturdy enough for everyday wear and elegant enough for dressy occasions excellent price and fast delivery i like the dual tone watch band because i wear both white and yellow gold the gold is n't as brassy as what shows in the picture excellent value	23
1	i read this years after i 'd read catcher in the rye and nine stories and it was cool to be reading salinger again but it was n't as rewarding as the first two books were maybe i let too much time pass and outgrew his style i dunno i felt as if i was reading a magazine story and not a book story i still would read everything he wrote tho if he released all new stuff j d salinger 's the man	23
0	his fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow there is some wisdom here and there but not worth the headache you 'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head here is an example if you say your own name to yourself at such a moment it will seem utterly alien you will then understand the sacrament of baptism huh \? at first i thought his writing may just be over my head but after re reading most of it i realized it was just bad it 's like the whole book was written when he was high or something some very good ideas but most can be found in other better written books	23

1	i love knowing the exact time \( even if my mom thinks i am crazy \) and it works like a clock ! i never have issues with the updates \( in illinois \) but i do have a few minor issues the watch is too thick \( 5 8 inch \) the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human the buttons are hard to press and the manual is too small and hard to read still if i had a choice between this watch or my borhter 's rolex i will take his rolex and exchange it for 40 casios thank you casio	23
1	these thong sandals run true to size and are very lightweight they are also a shiny patent material these are the pluses the one minus that is just a thing with me is that they come up far on my foot that is the toe piece seems a bit long i kept them because i know i will throw them on all summer to run around with my kiddos around the house i also do not think that they are really worth the price yes they are tommy hilfiger but the name is all you are really paying for they are an okay shoe overall not my favorites	23
1	maybe i'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product to accomplish the reports that i need i am able to edit the gantt chart view sufficiently to satisfy my purpose so it gets the report done just not as nicely as i had hoped tracking work is made incredibly simple rest assured you can manage a hefty project with this little piece of software	23
0	my daughter \( 3 at the time \) received this as a christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game the game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs \( 24 total pieces \) i would avoid this game entirely	23
0	by reading the cover i thought it would be a great product to have it indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without games bowling game is actually a teaser version you can play only two lanes others cost you extra two other games are not exciting themes and screen savers are mediocre i liked the analog convertor but not too much if you can get input from any audio device this program can convert it into a digital format alas it does n't convert to mp3 format also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast but not on the normal speed dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions i liked ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing bottom line i do n't think you would regret buying this at 17 dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week	23
1	i read some reviews that there were some compatability issues with this sensor and the main unit however i had no trouble at all getting this sensor to work with my existing unit and sensor once i realized i need to reset the main unit in order for it to recognize the newest sensor i have one sensor outside in my garage and the other downstairs in my basement and they both work well and are pretty accurate with the actual temperature this was an excellent purchase	23
0	my girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon this is by visiondecor furniture first it shows up on the curbside in pieces did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together \? this is not including the cushions the material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy i do n't know if it will last a year ikea furniture is actually better quality paid around 550 with shipping if she would have spent another 200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in los angeles she is very disappointed and wants to cry sad very sad	23
1	an extra lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone the desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts it saves time and one last thing to worry about the charge itself is fast too i have found the 750 mah lithium ion battery to be dependable nomatter at what stage of the remainng battery life you begin recharging it does n't weakin as did my i1000 battery when charging started at mid range however the first time you charge or recharge your lithium battery is the most important charge of all you must let the initial or first chatge run out completey before begining to recharge the battery the deader the battery on it 's first run the better the life of the battery and standby time for charges to come highly recommended	23
1	this bimonthly magazine is a wish book for those of us who do n't have two full time gardeners on staff or a few acres of woods to devote to bluebells or the ruins of an ancient abbey to train roses against my regency ancestors were breaking their backs on hardscrabble new england farms rather than building follies or planting mazes or having their grounds landscaped by capability brown oh but what if i 've subscribed to the english garden for many years now and i do n't think i 've ever gotten anything useful out of it but the gardens photographed within its glossy pages are to dream for acres of blooming rhododendrons statuesque old sequoias that were planted when victoria was queen lavender hedges outdoor rooms that have been replanted to a 17th century plan a sundial pool and of course a bluebell wood there are plenty of suggestions for the serious gardener for example the current issue \( july 2005 \) features the following for year round colour buy a couple of peacocks their screams will also scare away the burglars one gentleman favors beer for slugs although i do n't dare use it here the gardeners would drink it ! hazel twigs bent over beds and urns will deter the peacocks add a touch of history to your garden with an italian carved white marble seat it can be picked up at sotheby 's garden statuary sale for a mere 25 000 40 000 pounds \( i absolutely lust for this bench but alas my pension must be spent elsewhere \) use perfumed plants in the conservatory because the warmth generated by the glass pumps fragrance through the house plant marigolds in your walled kitchen garden to keep eelworm and whitefly at bay flank the path to the summerhouse with rhododendrons and white narcissi to break up a long path use arches lightly clothed with jasmine or clematis if some of the above tips are a bit too steep for your pocketbook you can do like me and drool over the marvelous photographs of someone else 's jasmine arch and italian carved marble	23

1	so glad i did n't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them this wallet is slimline and holds all my cards it 's been 6 months since i wrote this review and i only become more satisfied with this wallet all my cards are easily accessed viewed and i know immediately if one is missing the leather is silky soft and durable people have been asking where i found this item i think it 's the best i 've ever purchased	23
1	i was looking for the lightest slimmest possible wallet and the dopp getaway is just about perfect for the first couple of weeks i kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there it 's that unobtrusive it 's made out of soft thin leather \( so thin actually that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface \) that might affect the durability but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down the illustration shows a large embossed crest but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying dopp at the bottom a significant improvement in my mind the wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch open on the top and one side to hold your cash there 's also one additional pocket that 's ideal for other documents you just have to carry the only slight negative for me was the caramel colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket i do n't know why they used such a low class material there it 's invisible from the outside and not really offensive but if i could change one thing that would be it i debated knocking off a star for it but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that i thought it deserved the full five stars overall if you 're disciplined about what you carry you 'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet	23

0	this cd has some good songs on it but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes ! it 's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than i expected they are mixed together and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started ! if you do n't mind really short songs buy this but i would n't recommend it otherwise	23

0	i 've owned a fairly heavy seiko kinetic for several years and recently had it repaired when it began having trouble holding a charge to avoid problems with my reenergized time piece i decided to invest in a winder after comparing online prices and reading dozens of reviews i thought i had found a reasonably priced solution to keep my seiko moving this winder does everything it 's supposed to do \( spin stop reverse etc \) but ca n't provide sufficient motion to activate the charging mechanism inside my heavyweight watch unfortunately my kinetic may have made it 's final sweep around the dial on the bright side i now have a winder that i can only hope does a better job with my next automatic watch	23
0	i liked this when it first came out b c i was 16 i was a rebel wanted to be part of something different this is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while favorite song is mongoloid totally strange but rocking song uncontrollable urge rocks \( in a weird way \) and come back johnny is almost a conventional song satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song the group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a kiss multi media making money kind of thing i saw them live \( they were horrible \) during their hey day the most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream devo is still as odd of a group as ever mark motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work \( rugrats \) and you can hear the devo in all of his work anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is devo came out as a goof not as serious musicians they got big in the 70 's b c they were part of the new wave and kids \( like me \) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own	23

1	it 's hard to do better than a weber and this grill has not disappointed in the two years i have owned it i use it 3 4 times a week and have cooked just about everything you can imagine on it i am very satisfied with its performance but it has a few minor flaws i still have my genesis series propane grill that is still fine after 12 years but it was not big enough so i moved up pros stainless does n't rust large enough to cook a substantial amount using indirect method last night i simultaneously grilled 4 t bones 10 skewers of tequila lime shrimp sweet peppers and bread that 's why i wanted this grill i need room to cook insulated box holds the heat well first side burner i 've had that actually works assembly was relatively easy strong rotisserie motor spin a turkey or 3 chickens no problem the smoker box w its own burner is a great feature stainless grates are better than any others i have used in past lots of shelf space w fold down shelves battery fired push button starters for all burners is easy and reliable in all weather conditions cons expensive but i do expect a long service life gas guzzler more than one tank is helpful could n't find a cover that fits it but it is stainless gas gauge does n't work that well but no biggie the bottom of the cookbox has warped a little resulting in the grates being loose and shifting more than i 'd like on occasion when cleaning the grates they will fall into the bottom of the cookbox i can work around this and probably fix it without too much trouble but it does tick me off this cost them my 5th star i expected better so i pretty much love this grill and it 's a good thing because i believe i 'll have it for a good long while chad the weird chain on the door is for manually lighting the grill it is a match holder on a chain attached to the door so you wo n't lose it go figure	23
0	released by atlantic five years after it appeared in australia presumably to meet high demand for ac dc 's music this international version of dirty deeds done dirt cheap is a farce once again somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence and replacing both r i p \( rock in peace \) and jailbreak two of the strongest numbers in the album 's aussie version with t n t 's rocker and love at first feel an ok if not spectacular song ah and problem child already featured in atlantic 's version of let there be rock is also included in here the same song in two different official albums marvelous ! oh yeah and somebody hired hipgnosis in order to re design the front and back covers that was a cute detail but the aussie version 's covers \( classic mid 70 's cartoonish artwork \) are far more appealing who 's to blame for this rip off \? somebody at atlantic records \? some members of ac dc \? maybe both \? who cares anyway \? once again now that i 've got used to the aussie album listening back to this product feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated low quality spirits every enthusiastic record collector knows that both warner music and sony music are serious labels that took and still take risks by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will so it seems that with their approval of this re issue the surviving members of ac dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on and on and on if this is so well guys we the fans made you filthy rich we deserve the real deal available worldwide at a reasonable price i only give this product a 2 star rating just because love at first feel remains unreleased in australia how unusual ! a final word about this re issue i do n't own it in the words of pete townshend i wo n't get fooled again in order to get bonus material you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome internet gimmick if bon scott \( undisputedly the band 's most uncompromising member ever \) was still alive i believe things would be different by the way if you are interested in the real stuff please be so kind as to read my review of dirty deeds done dirt cheap \( import \) other items to be avoided the skimpy retrospective ep '74 jaibreak and bonfire a rather steep box set in which at least 6 songs are repeated twice in different versions none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac dc 's first four aussie albums	23
0	my second review as my first did not get printed \( as usual \) anyway i 'll try to make this short and sweet i usually try and give credits to directors producers writers and actors in most of my movie reviews however i'm going to make an exception here i 've read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd hilarious night of the living dead money color wonderful for gorehounds etc etc etc all i can say is it must not take much to please you people this is without a doubt the worst excuse for a movie i 've ever seen \( my most humble apologies to tobe hooper and mortuary \) the whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning why do n't critics take horror movies more seriously \? well einstein here 's a glowing example this is nothing but grade d trash horrible effects horrible acting horrible writing horrible directing you name it it 's not in there this movie 's most feeble attempts at humor come off as just that feeble i bought this together with dead and breakfast and i ca n't begin to tell you which one is worse so here 's a little advice from me go check out a book at the library buy a book go to a real movie have your hair done have a manicure do anything but waste your time on this gag fest \( for all the wrong reasons \) of a movie another one that i would give zero stars to if i could	23

0	as a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the sw i can say that red or any other color dye is nonsense ! not needed quite likely harmful also i question the instant nectar instructions say it does n't require boiling is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth \? if so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers it could harm their natural internal flora	23
0	i love peterson 's guides but the birds of mexico is severely lacking the art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to north america but unfortunately it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other peterson guides perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of peterson guides but otherwise buy howell 's or edward 's guides both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone howell 's is certainly the most complete but edward 's guide is a bit handier in the field	23
0	i 've seen better high end audio books i'm certainly not a member of the aforementioned scientific school of audio system performance analysis the only instruments that can accurately measure sound quality are the ones on either side of your head i listen to what my ears tell me sounds good and generally tubes sound good which is why this book is sort of a disappointment you 'd think that out of 80 projects there 'd be at least one tube phono preamp but unfortunately there are no tube amps just a few rants about how tubes do n't produce enough power who uses more than a watt anyway \? even the transistor amps presented are n't much better than what you could get from rex or circuit city similar schematics could probably be found on the internet for free go ahead and buy it if that 's the sort of thing you 're into but if its tubes you want try morgan jones' building valve amplifiers it does n't have many schematics but it covers in great detail the layout and contruction of tube amps good schematics can be found on the intarnub	23

1	this might be the best cd that has come out this year it may be will oldham 's best cd since viva last blues it may be better than viva last blues although these are two different styled cds the letting go has a mostly very mellow sound almost every song is beautiful the string and guitar melodies are uplifting will oldham 's voice is grounding it is the familiar voice you have heard for the past decade or so dawn mccarthy 's voice will then again lift you up mccarthy 's voice is a fantastic companion to oldham 's other singers bands have tried to use a female voice to echo or accompany the lead vocal and it has often become irritating this is not the case with the letting go mccarthy 's accompaniment adds so much to the album but without taking away from oldham i have n't listened to a will oldham album since ease down the road this makes me want to go back and listen to those albums i have missed one song in particular the seedling \( i believe \) has a different sound than the rest of the album it has a harsher sound but is still a good song this is a great introduction if you are new to oldham or if you are returning listener	23

1	tazo 's lotus decaffeinated green tea is one of my favorite tazo teas the lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful this tea is not bitter or harsh in any way it is one of the most natural tasting of the tazo 's i 've tasted very subtle and much less artificial tasting the ingredients in lotus are naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors of course this tea is caffeine free tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea on the paper tea packet tazo writes delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of lotus as peach nutty flowery overripe melon this surprisingly full flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light bodied with an aroma reminiscent of freesia tazo also describes the aroma as tropical fruit green tea hmmm i do n't taste all of these various flavors and i suspect that tazo really pushes the creative writing limit i taste green tea and a nice flowery flavor which i'm assuming is the lotus but not the rest the peach nuts melon freesia tropical fruit they 're missing from what i can discern here i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi i'm soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo lotus gets only four stars	23
0	i was so disappointed in this film the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because of the heart and soul terrance howard put into his acting i love terrance he is an outstanding actor but seeing him playing a pimp was just embarrassing he did an excellent job with the acting but i would have much rather seen him portraying marvin gaye call me naive but is pimping still actually going on in memphis tennessee in this day and time \? and did terrance howard give ludacris' character a cassette tape to listen to \? not a cd a tape i probably would have flushed it down the toilet too and the hook to that song you know it 's hard out here for a pimp ya think \? with prostitution being illegal in the state of tennessee and all i found myself cringing and sliding down in my seat in the theatre when she began to sing because i was so embarrassed do n't get me wrong i love my black people but sometimes when we get a chance to make a major motion picture we just do n't quite bring it do we \? the cookout how high \? girl 6 woo kingdom come now we can add hustle and flow to the list i'm glad terrance howard redeemed himself in crash do yourself a favor and pass on this one	23
1	i am pleased with this frame no logos and has a clean stainless steel look about it my only issue is the bottom part of the trim is a little tall and so oregon plates which have a registration sticker tag that goes at the bottom of the plate is hardly visible	23
0	it seemed like it would be a great way to store cereal but it made more of a mess than it was worth it spit cereal all over the place i used special k and kashi granola cereal so it may work better if you used it to store something soft like oatmeal or gummy bears ! i returned it	23

0	i started with caesar2 back when it came out i played it for hours and hours and loved it when caesar3 came out i bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing both caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed things have changed ! i'm spending more and more of my time restarting caesar4 than i am playing it about 8 out of 10 times that i access the area where you trade with other cities it crashes without trading you make little money and the game is essentially over other problems i'm seeing is overall performance i do n't have the fastest machine \( amd 2 1ghz 512ram rockin' video card with 256meg of mem \) but there are irritating 1 second delays in addition to the crashes i find the whole game to be difficult to use this was not the case with caesar3 unless they issue a patch i'm done feel frustrated with crashes maybe i can dumb down the graphic setting to get rid of the delays my suggestion \? wait for a patch before buying or move on jason	23
1	i bought this to go with my ms2 200bpt shaver i saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well i 've been using it for about 1 month and i could n't agree more a quick spray on the cutters after shaving and the next time i use it it runs like new i can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since i 've started using it as a bonus it seems to last quite a while another strong product from remington	23

0	i was rather disappointed with both doll tv and the item the coin looks like it was made of cheap plastic i have toddler toys made of the same material the packaging is also very cheap and childish for a limited edition collectible i was certainly expecting a lot more for a limited edition replica which costs 25 00 when i contaced doll tv to discuss the item i was told that this was an exact prop replica of the coin necklace worn in the movie and that they would refund my shipping costs if i removed my comments i did n't even pay for shipping !	23

1	one feature that has n't been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you wo n't hear any extra noise from emf also make sure you check your xbox settings once you 've plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under display settings for choosing hd capabilites make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there is n't that much difference	23
1	this is a great product the golden flax is slightly better tasting than the brown its good enough to put in muffins and \( for us \) toppings such as apple bake where you can taste it we actually do consume enough to justify buying it buy the box we also consume it in shakes but its best when baked works great in cornbread too we also get stone ground flours and cornmeals and these three make up a lot of value in this department flax oil of course is very high in short chain omega 3 's fish oils are better but if you have the other nutrients and enzymes in your body you can make the long ones from the ones in flax hence this product fulfills this need very well \( flax is very concentrated in short chain 3 's \) did i mention it actually tastes great in baked goods \? bob 's red mill is a quality product	23
1	the story of hansel and gretel is more than a warning against children talking to strangers \( or trying to eat their houses \) the recurring image of the forest in german fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen while the fact the father of hansel and gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time therefore what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions \( she stores not only treasure but food \) which would make her death some sort of proto marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction in the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as little brother and little sister the brothers grimm chose hansel because it was a common name in german fairy tales \( their equivalent of john doe so to speak \) and picked gretel for essentially the same reason \( which makes her jane doe \) gretel \( or gretchen \) is a form of the name margaret which in latin \( margarita \) means pearl all that background makes it rather ironic that for its twisted fairy tale series mcfarlane toys has turned gretel into a german princess striking a pose that suggests getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries this six inch figure has tattoos a spiked collar around her neck and torn fish net stockings there are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood she also has a mop and a pail and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them \( the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the grimms tale \) twisted fairy tales is the fourth series of mcfarlane 's monsters and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only gretel 's tag team partner hansel but red riding hood peter peter pumpkin eater and little miss muffet if you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that mother goose had a twisted sense of humor with these figures mcfarlane toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level even if you do not want the entire set there should be one of these figures that captures the jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you	23
1	i found this product to be very unique and helpful in that i could quickly remove retain the glasses around my neck being far sighted i have come to need reading glasses and these are perfect for my needs i can look 'down' through them and look 'over the frame' for distance all while they are secured around my head and neck i do hiking using a gps device and these glasses allow me to look down at the gps device in my hand while also looking forward towards my path of travel thank you for the innovative product	23
0	i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i could n't have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous 'insights' it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value	23
0	this is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music this is ridiculous ! kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game please please please spare us and stop rapping	23

1	i own a detail shop i have tried many products over the years and have found the polymer products work the best i use zaino as my main finish protectant but did give nxt tech wax a try i always try new products on my own cars before any customers i waxed both my 2004 auto 's in the same weekend 1 with zaino 's and the other with nxt tech wax as far as i can see the nxt went on and off as easy left as deep a shine and seems to stand up to the eliments just as well as the zaino 's with the only real difference being price i 'll be using the nxt tech wax from now on	23
0	less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition this book more aptly excerpts the author 's personal conflicts with human relationships a one on one wrestling match with the self with no spectators and no judges the book is a good read for academic analysis but not so fun for venturist philosophy	23
1	totally awesome my favorite game ever the sound is revolutionary the graphics are top notch it is so real you 'll freak although the ps2 version has four extra levels and thirty minutes of impressive new dialoge and cinematics so i would buy the ps2 version if i were you a must own for every gamer it will change your life	23

1	you use the peel kit by mixing a clear gel capsule with water and smear that onto your face you then put some cream on top of the gel on your face which mixes together creating a shaving cream beard after using the creams you then scrape it off using a tongue depressor look alike to shave off the foam after a quick rinse my skin looked less dull and helped clear blotches 4 stars because i ran out of the cream and still have some unused gel capsules	23
1	the product if reviewed just on taste would only warrant a two but the convenience is worth a five it is probably the best la briute product that i have found it is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable but it is way too salty	23
0	i never received this magazine so how would i be able to rate it \? \? i cant even find a way to let them know i never received it	23
0	this film is visually stunning and impressive and has talented and credible actors unfortunately there is barely a story with a lot of poorly developed characters who are trained brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity the settings and group sermons from nazi officials are striking and convincing but there is nothing that ties it all together our hero fails to strike the killer blow and is stripped literally and figuratively of all status and walks away the end i'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film and i was surprised by how un gay it was in fact the two boy friends work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress it 's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else i have issues with some of the pacing as well i found myself pressing the fast forward button several times and did n't really seem to miss much not a good sign so for what it is it 's okay certainly not a masterpiece and certainly not something to run out and buy	23
0	pictures do not come out very good poor quality ! i would not recommend it	23
1	i got this for our 3 year old daughter 's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night i would n't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room the top and back do get hot although you 'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned bumping into it should not cause any burns i have n't noticed any odors or noises from it	23

1	from a pure image quality standpoint this lens will not please the pixel peepers on the wide end of the zoom which i personally use more often than the telephoto end this lens is not very sharp and it suffers from fairly bad distortion worse than that for me are the chromatic abberations this lens is quite prone to significant ca when shot at the wide end which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness given the price of this lens one should expect a higher level of optical performance the maximum aperture of this lens is not very large being f 4 on the wide end and f 5 6 on the telephoto end the image stabilization makes up for this some as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise but let 's be honest here this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod the small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark \( using a tripod \) yet i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars and this is not without reason first of all the focal length range is quite handy it is n't a mega zoom that does everything however it covers the most often used focal length ranges and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations the little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion and it 's also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some it might be soft on the wide end but zoomed in it 's quite good i have printed as large as 20x30 using this lens on a digital rebel and have no qualms with the results yes there are sharper lenses out there but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print this lens has ring usm which enables it to focus very quietly and very quickly whereas the slightly cheaper \( and f2 8 \) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison if you want to use this lens indoors you are best off getting a flash to go with it such as a 430ex the lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting or during the day but wo n't give you good results in low light with no flash if you will be shooting in lower light situations \( people in particular \) tamron and sigma have some good options in the 17 50mm range with f2 8 apertures and i would recommend those lenses over this one if you 'd prefer the extra telephoto range the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field \( instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f 4 for instance without image stabilization you could use f 11 on this lens and get a sharp picture with better depth of field this is even more useful in the close focus range while this is n't a true macro lens if you take closeup photos without a tripod you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field and the is helps with that quite a bit overall i 've been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens if you like to worry about splitting hairs and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer this lens is likely to dissapoint you if however you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded useful lens then i 'd recommend it however would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options as they are also great lenses and do offer a somewhat better value	23
1	this item was easy to find purchase and use saved us several dollars as well a true win win thanks	23
1	this product is a must have for your shure earphones once you use this with the earphones you will not want to use the headphones without it just takes a little getting used to	23

1	other than the months of waiting for nikon to deliver them to amazon for shipping the battery itself in a good deal they work well charge up easy and hold their charge nicely priced well they cost less than the same type battery than canon or sony i bought them for a d80 and the older en el3a would not fit of course i had 10 of the older batteries for my d70s and was rather surprised when they did n't fit the d80 basically the same size and shape but keyed differently i was also surprised to find the 3e would fit in the d70s meaning they are backward compatable	23
1	i have had a weber silver b grill for several years i have found that the igniter works for about two years then just does has to be replaced this is an easy replacement and is not expensive this ignighter works as well as any i have seen and i think the minor cost and inconvenience of replacing the ignighter is offset by the quality of the grill	23

0	this purchase was done by my husband \( need i say more ladies \? \) this soup \( if you can even call it that \) was a waste of money there was hardly any seafood in it at all and what little there was it was in small pieces it was more like 'cream in a can' my son and husband are both big soup eaters and love chowder let 's just say that he bought a case of the stuff and 10 cans are still sitting in the pantry awaiting the next garbage day ! i will admit that i did n't try it it did n't smell or look appealing but if my husband \( the human garbage can \) says it 's awful stuff i take his word for it and so should you !	23

1	this is an amazing dvd i read reviews online all the time saying anyone will like this but seriously i even showed it to my mother who laughed that 's a big deal this dvd follows these four comedians on their two week tour their nightly shows are spliced together with scenes of them in their bus on their way to that particular city also throughout the episodes it shows the comedians in interviews discussing comedy in america during her time of need interpersonal relationships and anything else they could think of this dvd makes me laugh to tears every time literally	23
0	but i wo n't buy this again it smells good and dipping it into one of the bare escentual powders to make a lipstick is neat but the product does n't really moisturize my lips and i have n't found a color i like on my lips once i dip this into a bare escentuals powder i wo n't be buying this again i will probably just try a lip gloss next time	23
0	after owning a p touch labeler for years i found the need for a more duable label than my m tape was providing i opted for this tz tape labeler good price looks good what a mistake ! ! ! the only thing well designed about this unit is it 's abilty to waste more tape than it uses ! ! if you print a label of any size count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it ! ! ! at 20 00 a roll prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button then go find the scissors and cut the excess off so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk ! ! ! but cheer up you can push six buttons every time to reduce the margin to narrow this will reduce the waste to a half inch on one side of the label and print two small dots on the other side this will show you where to cut it with your scissors to match the narrow side also you must do all settings for every label every time ! ! another great feature it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size so you will only print large print what a joke ! ! ! what a hassle ! ! now the good news i used to make lots of labels and now i only make labels for very important items and only when i am up to getting mad for doing so i really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars ! you have been warned	23

1	i am sure this is a good stroller \( that 's why i bought it ! \) my review is more of a word of caution this thing takes forever to arrive do n't be fooled usually ships within 24 hours really means may ship sometime as of 2 8 06 our stroller has not arrived it was ordered january 1 2006 it is not even slated to ship for another week \( we 'll see \) meanwhile the local store has several in stock my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion go to your local store otherwise be prepared to wait a very long time	23

1	this is a very enjoyable film in which everything from the acting to the music to the costumes is just right it depicts an earlier friendlier los angeles and makes one want to get into a time machine and go back to an aviation nut such as myself it is heaven perfectly capturing the excitement of the golden age of aviation the music fits the action so well in fact there is a performer on the air show circuit who does old time aerobatics and uses the the theme music from rocketeer as his performance music most excellent ! the joy and fun of this film carries beyond the actual watching of the film i wish there were more movies like it	23

1	i bought this knife and block set as a christmas gift for my wife she loves it our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on amazon or for that matter on the box it arrived in the picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives the block we got is the one now shown in the amazon add apparently henckel made a change in their set about the same time i ordered it we can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for 50 more than what i paid for it in december 03 i would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me the knives are well crafted have a great feel extremely sharp and we love them there were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another henckel knife we already owned and one other we also love the selection of knives especially the paring knife and small serrated knife some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we 've not noticed either of these conditions	23
1	beginning with the introduction i was taken on a fabulous journey these gifted authors write a wonderful narrative lande 's snapshots add a lot to this impressive and comprehensive companion they are as engaging as any short story in the new yorker ! i found the collection of old posters designer appealing integrated with beautiful photography as one would expect from national geographic the guide is uniquely for both armchair and active travelers and two books in one the first carefully expertly evaluates top ten lists on everything travel related from hotels to hideaways national parks to international markets subjective of course we all have our favorites i particularly liked a chapter called ten best things to do on sunday afternoons in ten cities part two includes literary and historical journeys elevating this travel guide above all others ready made and travel ready i'm on my way on the road to mandalay ! the book ends at lands end with a country by country supplement to best destinations what a travel kit ! national geographic 's ten best of everything is passport perfect in every way you 'll love every moment	23

0	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine and would n't do that but i was wrong sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating i would stay away it prints nicely but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes i see other reviewers have the same problem	23
0	i'm giving only one star because this item costs more to ship than to buy ! ! ! was charged 5 75 for shipping this is a total rip off dean deluca should reconsider using a more economical shipping method i hope this product is worth five stars taste wise	23
0	this game has a good concept nice graphics and some definitely funny moments but the gameplay is a total bore there are two main gameplay styles investigation and trial investigation is the worst it involves nothing more than checking everything in a room talking to everyone and a ton of pointless reading much like an old point and click adventure on pc the court sections are a little better but not much once again it 's very linear you do n't have to use your brain much just try all the options and once again there is a huge amount of reading there is way too much dialogue packed into the game and not near enough actual gameplay and most of the talking is aimless too very little of it actually advances the plot overall this game just tried way too hard to have good plot and characters and left the player with little more to do than click on objects and scroll through text	23

0	when i first got this home it seemed to do the trick ok the mice really avoided it however we could still hear them across the room i was going to order a couple more to place around the room but they walk right past it now ! it does n't seem to affect them at all ! for 20 it 's not a bad deal because obviously it works for some people it just did n't work for us	23
0	i have a compaq presario laptop with windows me i wanted to upgrade it so i decided to buy the windows xp upgrade i have another computer that came with xp built in and i like that system a lot well before i purchased this software i specifically asked the manager at compusa if there are any problems upgrading from windows me to windows xp i was very specific no problem ! he told me it works great ! nonsense ! here is a list of hardware problems i had after loading windows xp onto the laptop 1 my touch pad stopped working 2 my pci bus started getting errors 3 my wireless network card \( d link gw 630 \) stopped working and these are just the things i noticed in the first day of using it ! i spent over six hours on the telephone with various technical service reps at microsoft uninstalling and re installing the software being put on hold reinstalling drivers restarting the computer over and over and over and over again six extremely frustrating hours ! finally the tech support people told me to uninstall the software they said i should return the software to compusa now for the fun part compusa refused to take it back ! ! ! after arguing with the very same manager who told me everything should work great all i got was an offer to do an exchange for the same product then the manager said my system must not be compatible well i showed him the system requirements on the box where it says windows me according to the box my laptop is perfectly compatible ! but apparently it 's not then the manager told me that he would not recommend upgrading from me to xp well intyeresting he says that now ! i reminded him about our conversation ! ! ! i even gave the manager my microsoft case number so he could see for himself the problems i had and all the tech support people who tried to fix it for me in the end i am stuck with software that does not work learn from my trials do not buy this software if you have windows me only buy it if you can get a written agreement from your seller that they will take the software back after it messes up your system	23

1	i have got to say that this is definitely the best cheesecake book ever initially i was shopping around for one since my boyfriend 's favorite dessert was cheesecake i ran across this and decided to get it well one of the best choices i could ever make i think this is an amazing book ! starting from the recipes which are so numerous and so varied that they have to be divided into beverage based chocolate vanilla candy etc even one for light cheesecakes ! honestly deciding which one to try the first time around was the toughest challenge when starting out well i followed the instructions clearly as well as the first section on tips to avoid it cracking and boy did it ever come out wonderfully ! i never looked back i 've baked from it endlessly for some years now tasting practically all of the recipes included it 's gotten to the point where i may soemtimes tweak the recipe and or ingredients a bit and it still comes out great ! my family has enjoyed all sorts of different flavors and many of my family members and friends have converted and use nothing but this to bake cheesecakes also my copy is so beat up from use it may be time to get a new one did i mention that this is also a beautiful book \? full of wonderful \( yummy looking \) glossy pictures my only \( tiny \) complaint is that on occasion some of the ingredients may be a little hard to get but nothing too major and definitely nothing 's that stopped me yet i do have other cheesecake books which people have given me over the years but due to simplicity astounding variety and plain old wonderful results this is the one i recommend the most	23

1	sadly the dvd does not contain the special features i had hoped for like deleted scenes or a commentary but that does n't detract from the movie which i think could n't be more perfect do you already love michael \? then buy this movie for your collection just to have andie mcdowell singing about miles ralph and bradley is worth the price of the dvd all by itself	23

1	a comedy with a bitter sweet edge the purple rose of cario has a fairly simple premise cecilia \( mia farrow \) struggles to make ends meet during the great depression her husband monk \( danny aiello \) is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent the only escape that cecilia has is going to the movies the fantasy world of hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world her favorite movie the purple rose of cario featuring gil shepard \( jeff daniels \) as tom baxter \( also jeff daniels in a dual role \) changes her life when the character tom baxter walks out of the movie into the real world he says he 's in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except cecilia 's sister cares about the rest of the characters in the film \( edward herrman milo o'shea deboarh rush zoe caldwell john wood van johnson \) are pretty upset and end up sparing with the audience watching them on screen when they complain how boring the movie is purple rose is one of allen 's most complete films and captures all the wistfulness that lurks in the background of his films this dvd looks extremely good considering that the transfer is from 2001 there 's some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly on screen but on the whole it 's not a big deal allen has n't done commentary tracks are allowed extras on his releases which is too bad as there 's cut footage of viggo mortensen and michael keaton \( who was originally cast in the lead instead of daniels \) that would be of interest i do n't know if that footage still exists but if it did it would make a lovely addition to this why mgm did n't choose to include archieved footage of allen talking about the film and new interviews with the stars is beyond me this oscar nominated \( for best screenplay \) film certainly deserves a documentary on its making or at the very least a featurette we do get the original theatrical trailer and a booklet that discusses the making of the film a great movie that will hopefully get better treatment when it ends up on the blu ray format purple rose is still a treat and well worth picking up it 's also priced well at 12 14 at most retail outlets and at amazon com	23
1	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	23
1	i got a few packages of these used some for my daughter \( for the omega 3 fatty acids as they help with brain function she is speech impaired \) and for my grandpa \( who has high blood pressure had a stroke \) you simply add a few spoonfuls to your oatmeal my grandpa 's cholesterol went down 50 points in one month \( none of his medication had been able to do that \) my 5 y o daughter did n't notice this in her oatmeal i tried it and there is no added taste just health benefits \) great product we always have it at our house	23

1	i currently have version 1 0 on my pc it does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly it cleans internet cache history cookies and more ! i 've tried another internet privacy program but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned i especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser others can use my pc and wo n't be able to see what documents i 've recently opened which programs i 've recently run or what i 've searched for and what sites i 've visited online and that 's the way it should be ! this program can be set to clean up this information securely \( can be set to wipe not just delete the info \) another plus it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc the program i tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts \( and not very well may i ad \)	23
0	i am so sorry that i bought this book it is unfortunate that you do not have a penguin or everyman 's library edition first of all the book is too large to read in bed secondly whoever did the proofreading should be fired there are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading if the postage were not so expensive from israel i would return the book to amazon	23

1	my 5 month old daughter always put her face into the bumpers on her crib so i stopped putting her in the crib because i was afraid of her sufficating and without the bumbers her hands and feet could still get in between the rails on the crib and because she moves aroung so much i was afraid of her hurting herself so now i love puttingher in the crib because the bumpers are mesh and i do n't have to worry they were also real simple to put on because of the velcro and when you change the sheet on the crib its alot easier to get the matress back in because the bumper is so flat great product ! i highly recommend it ! ! ! !	23

0	well imagine my surprise when i picked up the february 2004 issue and found that things had drastically changed mainly in the editor 's letter it used to be 1 page now it 's just a small little column now that is exactly like other ziff davis game mags now the redesign isnt as bad as other zd game mags but the removal of the 1 page editor 's letter really steams me up at least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey 's scorched earth column it 's still 1 page it 's on the last page usually and yes the redesign is really bad in terms of readability most of the time they have a red or blue or yellow background and it 's really hard to read the text at times now at least their disc will auto load unlike pc gamer and what really pisses me off is when a magazine has a hot 100 section or a best pc 's or videocards or peripherals section and they hardly ever change the captions or descriptions come with it i'm sorry if i got off track a lot but i felt the need to i hope this review helped you edit 5 8 2004 pc gamer recently changed editor 's and the editor in chief was re assigned to become the editor in chief of the official xbox magazine the new eic of pcg is the former executive editor and i hate him so this is why i say cgw is now the best pc games magazine	23

1	i'm a great fan of earl grey tea and have enjoyed starting my morning with a cup o' the grand stuff for nearly fifteen years as it happens i am in very good company in this practice along with the likes of captain picard and the eponymous earl charles grey himself earl grey is one of the more popular and well known kinds of tea in the world and deservedly so despite general belief earl grey is not a tea varietal at all but simply ordinary black tea infused with bergamot a citrus flavor from the rind of the fruit try your cup with a few drops of fresh lemon juice for some occasional yet delicious variety it is also pretty neat to watch the lemon juice lighten the tea from dark brown to yellow as the citric acid reacts with the blend ! the tazo version of earl grey is one of the best i have ever tasted perfectly balanced light aromatic it 's the perfect start to a morning	23
0	this boat seemed like a great idea and my 7 month baby does like it it gets him in the water which is fun but i cant even take my eyes off him for one nano second he has fallen over the sides he has fallen forward between the seat and tube the seat is so small and there is so much space between it and the tube my babys legs fit fine in the leg opening this boat is dangerous i am looking for a new one	23
1	this is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he 's waiting for breakfast there are lots of things to shake spin and rattle the suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard also it 's very durable because he 's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it has n't broken yet ! at first i was n't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon' toy does n't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button now he does it on his own and hears the whole song i think that 's great i would recommend this set to anyone	23
1	it took no time to figure out how to use this seat my daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements so i am moving here from a 5 point harness britax to this booster in a second car the seat is easy to install and remove and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding i can definately see using it for travel on planes as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry my daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water they are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat highly recommended	23
0	this software will not load properly no matter how you try the online help is no help at all it gives you a few suggestions that all boil down to please try to re install their down loadable wizard informed me after using it that i needed buy the components that did n't load but were on the disk try and remove the parts that do actually load and they do not uninstall properly mcafee has a section devoted to removal of their software but so far all the suggestions have not worked need customer service and its 2 99 per minute from you 're first call i have never had such a horrid experience with a software from a reputable company in a long time i will never buy mcafee products again	23
1	great looking on my feet extremely comfortable and the price for a suede sandal like this is phenomenal ! i'm going to order more	23
1	we love it ! yes the volume is low but there 's a very simple solution to that put it near your head the best things about this device are the ac adapter and the fact that it will run all night i just leave it plugged in and turned on all the time \( our cat must think we live by the ocean now ! \) a couple of reviewers said their machines stopped working and would only play for 5 seconds if this happens to you turn it over and flip the switch off of demo mode it has the 5 second setting so you can try it out in the store we 're hooked on this thing now i may have to buy another one someday when my son moves into his own room	23

0	the dvds are a rip off although i'm counting on the rebate to at least break even \( not counting my time \) the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk \( i 'd recommend verbatim 's dvd r dl product made in singapore \) as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i have n't submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments	23
1	anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life \? right before he enters the bus i would love to listen to it again but i ca n't find it anywhere	23

1	for those already familiar i was excited about this edition when it was advertised that it now works with raw files this one of the advantages that adobe photoshop elements has i have a nikon digital slr and i often shoot in raw and have to convert to jpg if i want to edit with microsoft digital imaging when i went out to buy this anniversary edition in very small print it reads that it 's the same as the previous 2006 edition except support for raw files is no longer included still it was on sale \( 24 \) and i thought an upgrade would be cool when i used it i saw little or no difference in this than the microsoft digital image 10 i had already been using in my opinion upgrading from 10 is n't worth it for those new to this product let me start by saying i 've been a long time user of microsoft 's digital imaging products i enjoy the bright clean look of the interface more that that i love how simple it is to use i would recommend microsoft digital image to all skill levels but especially anyone who 's just starting out in digital photography and computers hands down it 's the easiest it does in one step what would take three photoshop elements you sacrifice come control but simplicity is the focus of this program adobe photoshop elements is more powerful but harder to use bottom line is if you want to concentrate on getting out and taking good pictures instead of spending lots of time editing get microsoft digital imaging for the average shutterbug it 'll edit just as good as photoshop elements in less time and for less money	23

1	dj shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today threading the thin line between commercial and underground and finding his niche somewhere in between \( as unkle says the middle ground between light and shadow \) dj shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth i was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release and actually purchased it before i bought endtroducing which is by far dj shadow 's best album and one of the best albums ever made by sampling elements from just about anywhere shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music i am actually glad i bought this album before endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is a work of art and a continual growing of shadow 's talents had i bought endtroducing before this and writtwn a review i'm sure i would have garnered it with a 4 star review but that is simply not the case here while endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album josh davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album and given us an album that i'm sure years from now i will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home \( possibly with a little mary in tow if you know what i mean \) the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows and the beats are flawless especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis see the thing is that shadow bases his music upon how he feels and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve radiohead for example has a way of doing this and it is not surprising then that one of dj shadows favorite artists is radiohead they both fuse these elements into their music and achieve monumental status in my opinion the package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package if you enjoy this album then i highly recommend any of shadows works endtroducing preemptive strike the private press and in tune and on time which is a live set recorded in support of this album unkle is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip hop rock and techno with guest appearences by mike d of the beastie boys thom yorke from radiohead and others from throughout the music industry if you 've never heard of dj shadow before then i must say that you are missing out if you are at all interested in underground music do yourself a favor and pick up any of shadow 's albums or collaborations i guarantee you will extremely impressed as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time peace out	23
1	this coffee is smooth and is not bitter at all it is wonderfully aromatic and a rich flavor i personally bought the beans in jamaica but it was only 12 for 12 ounces i have seen such inflated prices on the internet for this product and truly it is not worth it	23
0	i 've owned this toy for a few weeks and have given up on it at first this toy was a little fun and i was optimistic about getting it to handle correctly i 'd adjust the top screw to trim it from spinning clockwise or counter clockwise and everything this gets old after doing it every time after a charge next using the forward and backward control does n't work that well also it will drop out of the sky or do something weird every now and then all in all i would n't buy it again especially at the higher price it is currently going for try the smaller havoc it seems to handle a little better \( youtube has a few movies of it flying \)	23

1	james wong howe 's cinematography looks beautiful on the restored dvd version of this underrated film an unearthly intervention which brings us the actual physicality of the 19th century in light and radiance it was an era in which electric light was just being invented and candles and gaslight were still the norm that is among people with the money to afford them the unwashed faces of the coal miners and the families they supported form a canvas from brueghel but even the whole weight of the mining companies cannot extinguish the inner spark in their eyes filmed by the left leaning director martin ritt freed up from the blacklist that crippled the earlier part of his career the molly maguires finds ritt at a curious place picking at the ugly scab of us history that the scandalous molly maguires represents indeed historians argue whether or not there was ever a conspiracy among fenians to bring down the oligarchy of the oppressive coal mining companies through so called shillelagh law ritt was able to attract not only richard harris but top billed sean connery to this project for each of them a commercial risk indeed the movie re edited at the studio by nervous bosses probably does n't represent the script that connery and harris read samantha eggar one of the loveliest of 60s screen actresses took the leading women 's role which was turned down by anjanette \( loved one \) comer oddly enough thirty years later comer took the minor part of sue in tv 's recreation of the nine miners in pennsylvania who were rescued from the quecreek cave in in the summer of 2002 yes the film is depressing yes it is slow moving sparked by moments of intense brutality but give it a chance and savor its unique blend of 1870s locations and 1970 radical filmmaking	23
1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	23

0	i loved the first xenosaga then this arrived episode 2 ise n't a bad game in terms of the story the intro is absolutely dynamite then you get into a battle now if you like tactical stuff this is a good game for you but if you 're trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing i say save your money gone is the amazingly well done battle system in the first episode in its place stands a completely out of nowhere new way of battling that takes 15 minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies \( the easy ones in this game have around 2000 hps \) ridiculous but that 's not all the enemies have weak zones that depend of the height of the attack that you input the zones are a b and c a being the highest triangle c square b and circle a sometimes see what i mean \? it 's completely screwed up and you have to become deeplyaddicted to the game to understand its full potential and if that was n't enough they changed the voice actors too kos mos 'svoice sounds more like an operator than a robot 's and momo sounds like a brat at least chaos' voice has improved i 'd prefer playing episode 1 twice than playing this i just hope namco comes out with a better sequel otherwise spend your moey on something else \( like shadow hearts for example \)	23
0	i bought this product b c i ca n't stand the feeling of hair stubble on my legs i got sick of taking 20 minutes every other day to shave this product indicated i could remove hair in about the same amount of time but that it would last much longer than shaving i purchased it and waited a week to receive it once i received it i spent 40 minutes using it in this time i could have shaved both legs both underarms and my bikini line twice using this product i was not even done with one leg i went over the leg numerous times over that 40 minute period and it did not remove a single hair i pressed lightly i pressed hard i did everything but stand on my head and twirl my feet while rubbing my stomach and nothing made this product work as indicated others may have had luck with it but i did not i was not impressed and i would not recommend it to anyone	23
1	i received a very well packaged \( and promptly shipped even \) package of the habanero jerky from mahogany smoked meats the jerky itself it obviously made from good meat \( vs some of the garbage you 'd get from oberto or whomever \) the initial smell is excellent an aroma of pepper and brown sugar however the jerky itself is somewhat sticky the pieces of the jerky itself are stuck together so extracting a single piece for consumption becomes a chore after you 're done your hands are all sticky my guess is if they manufacturer spent a little longer in a dessicator we 'd have a drier product that tasted just as well as for how spicy well my lips are burning i like that i really love habanero \( and in fact grow several varieties at home \) this is n't some quot slightly spicy quot product with the name habanero in it to make it seem macho it will scorch your mouth in my opinion scorch in a good way the price is great you 'd spend that much at any store buying a far lower quality of jerky and just try finding habanero anything at safeway kudos to amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list additional kudos to mahogany smoked meats for having such a wonderful product i 've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky \( i guess it 's the sugar \? \) and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves definitely recommended	23
1	i am surprised to read that people do n't like this mirror we have had it since our son was 1 mon and we still use it at 7 mon we have a trailblazer and it installed easily and we can see him great even over his britax marathon carseat it has been great for road trips \( our son was entertained even on a 9 hour trip \) and has been a blessing for short trips to the store we do n't always use the music lights but the mirror is always handy we have never had trouble with it being too soft i have given this as shower gifts and my friends have been pleased as well def recommended	23

1	i love my cayman crocs my sister swore by these shoes but i was n't convinced because they are a little different looking i liked the bright colors i saw some people wearing at the beach this summer but i'm practical and they can only go with so many things i ended up purchasing a navy pair because they go with just about anything i'm not at all disappointed they really do n't look bad paired with casual outfits i wish they could make the soles of all shoes out of this stuff though because it 's amazing it 's not so much that you slip them on and say wow this feels great for me it was more so that after activities \( marathon shopping trips for example \) my feet were n't sore or tired when my regular shoes would have had them ready to quit i think they are great even with the different look though i do wish they 'd come up with a more stylish pair at some point	23
1	i really like these glasses they are attractive and pleasant to hold i prefer having a wine glass that does n't contain a lot of wine which is why i got these since they are the smallest in this line	23
0	okay i bought for the price and it is effective enough but it is very clumsy and unergonomic so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer the main problems are balance of weight and the switch first the switch because it is a cheap push in button which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on you lose optimum control quickly the handle is badly placed for this as your thumb must always be on top of the handle and forward toward the front of it but you ca n't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting in addition keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife but because the button sinks deep into the handle so your thumb is inside the handle as you 're trying to hold and control the knife quick cramp moreover as you 're pushing it in if the food you 're cutting is moist \( like a turkey \) juices may run onto the handle your thumb and into the hole into which you 're pressing the button not safe a couple times i 've wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock either way it was n't good then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good look at the huge bulk of the motor and then look at where the handle is located and how it is designed there 's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is add in the need to be depressing the power button as you 're holding it awkwardly and 2 stars for effectiveness minus 3 for bad functional design	23
1	do your banana 's turn brown and mushy before you have a chance to eat them \? this used to be a huge problem in my house but now that i have the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger this is no longer an issue i hang my bananas up the moment i get home from the grocery store they think they are still on the tree out in the wild ! silly bananas green bananas turn yellow quicker when they are hanging and yellow ones stay yellow longer once i got a bunch of those little mini bananas and those even fit on the hanger ! the lipper beechwood collection banana hanger is compact and does n't take up much counter space which is a definite plus and it 's almost like art in my kitchen putting those bananas on display	23
1	if you are looking for a great all around camera this is it ! our kids play sports and are in constant motion and the sports mode captures it all also love the last 4 feature gets some great action shots we had the fuji 7000 before this and they have definately fixed the features that bugged me love the new manual zoom \( if you like 35mm lenses your like this \) as well as the battery drain i used to have to replace batteries every day now its more like once a week with the amount we use it my other favorite feature is the dual memory slots for those times where i forget to put it back in the camera after downloading ! so there is always one in there ! the video comes out great and with the new manual lens you can zoom during video shots in general without spending a lot more you get a great camera that keeps up with an active picture happy family	23
0	this software does not come close to the once upon a time quality of adobe products it is shot full of bugs overall not only does it cause your photoshop system to quit working it affects your entire mac operating system adobe knows this is true because they try to cover up with a several page discussion about how operating systems not lightroom can cause problems their approach of blaming someone else is shameful the design of the product is marginal almost impossible to read the dark grey print on black backgrounds it is slower than anything i have ever seen i could go on and on but it only raises my blood pressure i have spent the entire weekend fixing the computer programs broken by this half done system if you buy it you will waste a lot of time like i did the software is going back to amazon tomorrow morning amazon shame on you for selling such a poor product	23
1	my whole family \( ages 7 68 \) greatly enjoyed all the horatio hornblower movies together they are well made and great entertainment a very acessible way to learn about the napoleonic wars it gives the viewers a real sense of how highly held personal honor and integrity used to be we ca n't wait for a e to continue the series	23
0	i look at the average raiting for this movie stars now thats supposed to mean its ok well ppl this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves i read some review saying the musicwas good and well from my perspective it seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment and i would almost barely knotice if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense it was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here save your money i bought this after seeing the first which was lame but i though it was ok and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something well this was in 6th grade huge mistake i hated it when i first saw it it seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it and about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play good considering its live but lame as far as movies get oh and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing i really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made but that was untill i saw reptillian which is kinda depressingly awfull	23
0	i read this book on a suggestion from a friend before i read reviving ophelia because she wanted to see if i would be as dissapointed with it as she was i was more so while there are some outstanding essays in this collection the bias of the editor clearly stands out there is no one for the outcasts to relate to there was no musician nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion there were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had the sections are poorly named and divided all in all it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original some girls it may make feel less alone but for me it only accentuated the differences definately take out from the library before you buy it	23
0	no support or response to questions only 1 2 of the functions work not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs try cosmic blobs	23
0	these are my experiences with the extender mounted to my eos 10d i'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30d but it looks like i do n't want to risk wasting my money let me explain let me start by saying that the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the lcd screen i shoot events at nightclubs a lot so i'm always \( a \) running around to get shots causing me to sweat which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and \( b \) i always show the subjects their photos after i take them so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying for further clarification i'm asian so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities i run around a lot when i shoot so the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off i got lucky once and found it in the general vicinity of where i was but the second time i was n't so lucky so what did i do \? i purchased another one not only did i have to purchase the extender i had to purchase the viewfinder replacement \( the piece with the soft rubber \) because that was attached to the lost extender another 2 weeks in and again same problem i did n't even bother buying any replacements as by this time i upgraded to the 30d if you do n't plan on doing a lot of running around then this piece may be okay for you however please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my canon backpack for some reason the piece did n't fit tightly with the mount on the camera another problem as most people mentioned is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day i guess i 'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30d i 'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10d	23
1	i first encountered this gem of a book when i decided to home educate my children for a few years and it came with my daughter 's fourth grade calvert school kit yes it is european ethnocentric and there are the references to god but our family was and remains enlightened enough and able to explain context even to children whether you are a bible thumper or dedicated atheist or somewhere in between do n't discount this book just because of your beliefs ! there is much that is amazing and simply golden in this book as a historian i cannot think of a better way to introduce western civilization to a child the storybook format is a real winner with kids and if you 're reading it to them aloud as i did well play editor as you go along ! or take the time to explain the context of the times in which it was written i will be ordering another copy of this book as my original copy was stolen by some rather sneaky and acquisitive ex inlaws \( you know who you are ! \) this book is a do n't miss and it is also excellent for adults who do n't like history but recognize the need for such knowledge	23

0	this is a pep rally on cd an unsingable emotionally charged pep rally it really upsets me that this is the face of today 's christian music the melodies are not easily singable at all and the songs use all the same musical cliches this is worship manipulation at it 's best if you read the words to learn something concrete about god you will find nothing of substance they talk about actions to give god and our response to god but no meat and potatoes of why we should be doing this god is great but why \? this is very disturbing and completely unacceptable for congregational worship	23
1	i purchased this as an extra phone so i could access both phone lines on the second floor of my house well built with hold and 3 way conferencing features sound quality is good and it has selectable ring levels for each line powered from the phone line no external power is used one drawback the line indicator does n't light when the line is being used by other phones in the house	23
0	this movie was so horrible i do n't know where to start maybe i could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street or maybe he just casted his own family at any rate they were untrained and stale secondly i had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi christian plays why would n't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit if you 're trying to actually sale to a christian audience furthermore i thought the bible said a little something against divorce like it was n't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery fornication this movie seems to say it 's okay to go against the word of god if you 're in love in fact christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice by even the protagonist ! i laugh as i think of the scene where ce ce peniston 's character says seductively i'm looking for a man with his mind on jesus yet she 's dressed like a hooker speaking of clothing why did ce ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene they go on a date and she 's dressed one way by the time they come home she has on something different with no logical explanation and please explain why they had someone 's grandfather playing the role of rico suave maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman 's dream i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him in addition the soundtrack it was just annoying at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music i just wanted the maddness to stop ! lastly it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate \( although some are \) however having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just well almost juvenile perhaps even a disrespect to women at large overall this movie made me want to puke pastor larry flash jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity	23
0	horrible i was very excited to play this as i am a huge fan of the arcade game of course i was n't expecting the quality to be the greatest but i was hoping for something playable track ball is stingy graphics are atrocious and there is only one course to play i have played better functioning playable golf games 20 years ago on an pc the idea was great but this just was n't made well do n't waste your money on this	23
0	i bought this mouse hoping to use it with my new hp dv2000 laptop with internal bluetooth i was excited about the instant view feature and the lazer percision however when i got the mouse connected it worked but no instant viewer \? turns out the instant viewer only works if you have the dongle pluged in but the reason i bought a bluetooth mouse was in order to avoid a dongle breaking off in the side of my laptop on top of all this the extra two buttons on the sides are awkwerd to press i have to contort my fingers in a arthritus inducing cramp to press them nothing like my old microsoft mouses' cozy side button the middel mouse button also is annoyingly resistant to press in order to activate mouse button three which is set to activate the amazing instant viewer which is decent but useless without the dongle as far as lazer percision not too noticable my kingston rf lazer mouse seemed to preform better the only reason i gave it a 2 5 is the charger is nice the battery is good and it has a nice brushed aluminum finish which feels nice and cool against the palm this makes a decent desktop mouse if you use the dongle which they include the connectivity is good and the percision is nice not something i 'd recomend for a laptop user for the price overall subpar	23
0	when yours truly was eleven and in reading class incident was required reading this had to be the most ridiculous book that i ever had the displeasure of reading i mean the boy is cared for by a badger ! badgers are mean and ornery critters that do n't much like people or even their own kind i did not believe it at eleven nor do i now also eckert certainly did n't need to include some of those descriptions was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring 's excrement \? what eleven year old wants to read about that \? so for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really did n't want to know about in the first place this book 's for you	23

1	i 've been consistently impressed by the bionicle toys from lego and the rahkshi are no exception wish i was young enough to actually play with this stuff sigh anyway rahkshi take the bionicle can sold figures to new a new level of articulation in total joints are found at the neck shoulder wrist hip knee and ankle and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff like weapon each of the rahkshi weilds then there 's the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech slug things through the air each one of these things appears to come with a miniature cd full of quicktime promotional stuff for the toys game web site etc the voice is a bit melodramatic but it 's still kind of neat i like the 360 degree rotating model of the toy you just bought sort of redundant since you can look at the one in real life but nifty all the same one thing that mildly disappointed me is that the rahkshi 's weapon is n't really an independanly existing object which is to say that the bar held between the hands is only attached to the hands not the heads of the weapon this is n't a really big deal except that it means you ca n't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand this could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces of course but it does mean you 'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else overall a very cool build it yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work or actually played with educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles as in any lego set durability seems good so far lego is pretty sturdy stuff	23
1	great magazine published out of the uk excellent features and great bits of trivia my favorite sections are cash for questions \( readers send artists questions and win cash \) someone asked lou reed if he really performed heroin for a conference of psychiatrists and won 25 pounds now \( new artists \) instant karma quot where pop and philosophy meet quot also great music reviews more than 200 in each issue of a wide variety of music genres but what they do really well are lists top 100 albums ever the 90 best albums of the 90 's etc my favorite being quot when rock stars go crazy the 100 greatest acts of rock'n'roll folly quot no 1 being michael jackson statue sails down the thames \( river in london	23

0	i ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for christmas and even though the stores were sold out she was sure that santa could get it for her when my daughter called to make sure that i had it actually in hand i said sure i ordered it from amazon ! after all the description said that was the swimming mermaid that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water it is not ! ! ! ! like the other lady said it is just another barbie doll in a green dress now i will have to pay a premium to get it from ebay \( where i could have gotten it for less a week ago \) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before christmas i will have pay 6 times what i paid for this deception and hope that santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed beware of this seller ! i see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description believe me it was there before	23
1	i enjoy all the features of this item the main compartment that hold the camera is soft and secure you can open it without worrying about your camera falling off the back compartment is roomy enough for all the basic gear the slot for memory cards 1 4 \( depends on the card type \) batteries \( roomy for four aa \) and cables can fit in it the shoulder strap is basic and looks flimsy it 's not long enough to hold comfortable diagonally but on the side is good the belt loop is very secure and can fit on belt three inch in width it can even handle the worst environment ever hot dry climate with sandstorms and occasional accidental drops it has protected my dig camera very well	23

0	i have an ics m4a1 i am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums i am registered to have said on this i am registered on arnies airsoft core and airsoft retreat 1 \) this gun is from a very very unreliable company \( well \) so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one this is common knowledge among the airsoft community 2 \) lets say you buy 4 of these guns each of them costing 100 dollars even over a 5 10 year span that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly people who have skirmished with an lpeg \( low powered electric gun \) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an aeg that shoots 330 fps with 2g \( standard for companies like toyko marui ics classic army g g airsoft elite \) the one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made 3 \) the gearbox \( part of gun that fires bbs \) broke on mine in short it has a metal gearbox made of the cheapest metal known to man the purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money it is very very weak definitely not worth it 4 \) the hop up on this gun is non existant the fundamentals of hop up is a backspin is added to bbs to increase range and accuracy effective range of this 50 feet \( not meters \) effective range of my ics m4a1 \( with a aftermarket tightbore added \) is 150 feet 5 \) this gun will get laughed at some children walk into an organized skirmish with this lpeg telling people that it will own all others and they will cry home when players with real aegs destroy them i suppose it is fine for backyard wars but who on earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars \? 6 \) the cost does not equal quality if you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun \( light laser ect \) then account for shipping from china then the packaging costs \( pre molded styrofoam \) you will realize that this gun is very very cheaply made you do not want to be spending so much for so little quality the laser itself can sell for 20 dollars put it short it is not worth it	23
1	i 've had subscriptions to just about every woman 's magazine there is over the past 8 years but the only one i always renew is glamour it 's less how to catch a man oriented than cosmo less pseudo hipster than jane and less serious than marie claire while it 's certainly no ms magazine it has a lot of women positive messages every issue articles that are n't as sensationalistic and fear mongering than most found in women 's magazines and lots of fashion and beauty tips i feel that glamour strikes the right balance between frivolity and seriousness for those of you who like a side of third wave feminism with your fashion i highly recommend it	23
1	i have been getting this magazine for a year now i have a few new favorites i make on a regular basis the pictures are pretty the prep times have been accurate for my cooking speed the ingredients are all easy to find in my local grocery store there is detailed nutrition info available for the dieters so if you are looking for some nice new things to make this is a great way to find them	23

1	i have enjoyed the oregon series watch it is good looking the band is comfortable and is holding up nicely the display is easy to read and the light is quite good my one complaint is that the chronograph is often difficult to clear i run a good bit and i was doing a workout the other day i had to keep holding down the clear button to get the old time off other than that i have enjoyed the watch immensely i thought the price was extremely reasonable as well	23
1	the watch performs as advertised atomic clock i live 2k miles from ft collins and the watch automatically syncs every night even if i do n't put it near a window solar recharge the watch arrived with a low battery it charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part the watch is big and heavy i take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand the watch 's user interface is unintuitive this is the first watch i 've owned where i had to read \( and re read \) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm i find the timex interface and the old style casio interface much easier to use in the interests of saving battery power the alarms are short and quiet i ca n't count on this watch 's alarms to wake me up it 'd be nice if the watch had a power hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations all in all i like the watch it is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and does n't run out of batteries i wish the user interface was more intuitive the alarms were more effective and the watch was smaller	23
1	hey can you please tell me when the next platinum timberlands are going to be in stack	23
1	this ep is so good that words cannot do it justice they thought so too and exercised restraint \( no lyrics \) on this album it is a departure from the previous album from the vapor of gasoline \( which is also a very good album \) in other ways too however it features a more delicate production and more intricate interplay between the instruments the production is such that it highlights the timbre of each instrument and thus their interdependency whereas the previous album seemed content to let everything settle into a murky consistency at various points \( usually when things started to rock \) ftvog also had the problem of being a bit monotonous \( of course in the end you grew to enjoy it for all its shortcomings \) all the suits began to fall off seems to be flawless however a well rounded tour very beautiful bold and particular try if you like john fahey tortoise june of 44 sea tiger etc	23

1	amazon grocery was fast and easy as usual and the mac cheese is great we ca n't get our five year old to stop eating it price wise its a fairly good deal in comparison to the grocery store	23
1	a couple of years ago we completed the transition over to the mac platform in our household both my wife and myself have a desktop and a laptop so leveraging the mac service to keep our personal configuration settings synchronized across computers has been fantastic further with the sharing features that are available we each have access to view the other person 's address book or calendar one of the great features of the mac service is how it is tightly integrated into the operating system in addition since the synch services capabilities in the operating system are documented and open third party programs can write plug ins that can leverage mac to propagate settings to different machines my favorite feature \( and the catalyst for my initial subscription \) is the backup application as someone who has suffered the inconvenience of crashed hard disk drives far too many times i wanted a simple comprehensive easy to use solution that i could use to backup my data to an external hard disk drive on a daily basis i 've used other mac specific programs before and none are as easy to use as the backup you get with mac the only real critique i have for the mac service is the amount of space available on the idisk when services like google mail can offer 2 7gb of space for free \( granted it is supported by advertising \) it makes the mac the space available with mac seem meager of course considering a full backup of my data settings takes up about 8gb of space i may be outside of the demographic that the mac service is targeting however in this age of digital media \( pictures and movies \) the amount of disk space people need for their memories is only going to go up but i guess that is why they have external drives and dvd burners	23

1	vanity fair is a highly recommended monthly magazine for people who enjoy reading packed with lengthy articles gorgeous photography and blurby information it never fails to entertain the reader it is the perfect companion for a lazy afternoon at the beach or on quiet plane ride across country the vanity fair forumla is simple slap a photo of a celebrity on the cover and inside offer a wide variety of articles including hollywood puff pieces domenick dunne 's true crime accounts in depth articles about international scandals christopher hitchens essays and profiles of colorful unknown characters though this formula has changed little since the magazine was revived in the 1980s by its now legendary editrix tina brown the magazine 's new editor canadian born graydon carter has succeeded in putting his own personal stamp on vanity fair in virtually every issue carter uses his letter from the editor to bash us president bush though i do not begrudge carter his right to speak his mind after months of reading carter 's criticism i get bored with these relentless rants still i highly recommend a vanity fair subcription to anyone who enjoys reading regina mcmenami	23

1	we got this bike for our 4 year old and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years the assembly instructions looked intimidating at first but since many pieces are already pre assembled you can skip most of them it was a lot easier than anticipated the only reason why i gave it 4 stars it had a deep scratch paint chip on the frame but since i got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway	23

1	this arm band is surprisingly good i initially got it for my boyfriend for his iriver but i was afraid it would n't fit his arms since he 's very muscular surprisingly it stretched enough and was n't tight ! he loves it i thought there might be too much motion on mine when i run or use the eliptical but no it 's fine	23
0	completely worthless ! if you liked the film go buy the dvd because this album has no redeeming qualities the sound quality is fair at best even for a live album almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song the `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason it would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this cd you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear the worst part about the album is the lack of the fugees which means no `killing me softly' sadly you can tell that most of the artists on this album have n't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible even for a live recording some of them sounded almost as bad as fallout boy on snl	23
0	after playing this game for the third time i had a thought 'why did i buy this ! ' this game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly i cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other nba street 's save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game	23
0	i was very excited to give this to my 8 year old pokemon addict the toy is very cheap comes in attached plastic and needs to be assembled when assembled the wing breaks off constantly and the tail does n't stay together junk !	23
0	i have been a reader of businessweek for over 10 years i have noticed that it has had a significant change in focus over the last year while there are more articles on personal business the hard core articles have gone the way of newsweek and u s news and world reports the nature of the articles are lightweight and do not reflect issues important to decision makers today like many others i have noticed a political slant or agenda over the last year specifically their commentaries and economic analysis trend to the left bob kuttner is co editor of the american prospect and contributor to the boston globe every one of his articles begins with the premise that the president 's policies are bad and then is followed by a tortuous rational for that thesis to include discussion of the days of gold backed currency andrea d'andrea tyson is better but as a former clinton advisor is not objective in her analysis alternative economic opinions are far and few between and what opinions they do tout does not agree with the numbers stated in their own figures of the week while bw has the potential for great reporting based on their resources they have let their editorial priorities get in the way of serious business reporting for serious business readers and students i recommend going to alternative sources and yes i will let my subscription lapse this year	23
1	this is a great product it was easy to mount and looks great the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches i have a 32 lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees this has n't caused any problems and i'm sure this is well within its design strength highly reccommended	23
0	i have been using this product now for almost a year the only reason i insist using it is because i feel really bad for wasting my money first this is not worth 300 bucks there are only still pictures and sound no movies or any fancy graphics so why the price \? second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences third the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all you keep memorizing thins like the boy is under the airplane or the ball is on the boy 's head initially i thought well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad but then i took a look at the last lessons you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue i cannot recommend you another course because i spent so much in this one that i do not want to try again and get disappointed do n't be fooled by the wonderful reviews like i was this is definitively not worth 300 dollars it is not even useful for basic converstion i have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library ah and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar	23
0	i should preface this reveiw with the fact that i am an accomplished home cook i have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks i do not buy commercially prepared products like breads crackers mayonnaise or salad dressings i make these items myself i suspect that i am not the target audience for this publication the may june 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total given that there are only 6 issues a year i was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages the may june 2006 issue contains the following information simplifying moroccan chickenbringing home fish and chipsgrilled tomato salsagrilled london broilmain dish vegetable stir frieshow to cook pastafoolproof veal scaloppinia new twist on chicken saladsgarlic and olive oil mashed potatoesutimate turtle browniesbest strawberry cream cakethe scoop on vanilla ice creama review of tongsif you are an experienced cook their is n't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you this issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking however i enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful this magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook bottom line i will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little more meat in their content i think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive i would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their best of cookbook instead it costs about the same amount contains many more recipes has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer additionally check out an issue of fine cooking which is another test kitchen type of publication just with more depth	23
1	yes i am slow to make this review maybe because i spend a great deal of time using this camera the only thing i would like to have changed is a rechargable pack at first i burned thru many batteries i switched to rechargables and find that i still use a great deal of power \( i shoot often with the flash \) but now i can recharge the spent batteries after each session i use the charge of 12 aa 's in a 3 hour shoot i use this camera for studio work and it has served me well for a good number of years already	23
1	we bought this clock to replace one of those cheap quartz wall clocks in our new \( used \) motorhome i wanted it so that i would not have to wear a watch but would still have a dependable and accurate time piece it took a couple of nights before the lacrosse atomic clock received the signal to synch up but after that it seems to be working exactly as advertised accurate right to the second this clock has a large protrudance on the back where the clock 's works reside so the bezel does not sit flush to the wall either a large hole needs to be cut in the wall or you just have to live with it no big deal but it is something difficult to see from photos on the internet this is why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars	23
1	i am a loyal long time fan of empire magazine and have collected almost every issue from no 1 being a british mag it differentiates itself from others like premiere and entertainment weekly by it 's frank dissection of all movies and provides a wide range of opinion and discussion i will always read empire and if you like movies you should too	23
0	after receiving putting together and using this toy with myself and children i overestimated what it would be i remember the old school rock 'em sock 'em robots and this product is n't even close the old characters stood 6 8 tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered this version has only plastic parts the characters are 4 tall at best and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest not the head metallo 's head springs up but superman 's head only nods backward it is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up it was only an 11 lesson for me to learn but if you truly want a real rock 'em set try ebay or yard sales this replica is not comparable to the original	23
1	these earrings are beautiful they are big so they look best if worn by themselves very light so they are very comfortable	23
0	sorry there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months runs too small and was completely to thin sheer can be seen straight through	23
1	bought these several months ago at ross dress for less in oregon for 19 99 i love them i bought them in a off white since that was the only choice love the comfort of them think the t strap stays on my foot much better than the older birk style which is too wide sloppy on my foot the t strap is cushioned so it does n't hurt my wee toes i wear a size 8 8 1 2 depending on the brand these say 39 5 do n't know if that is correct sizing or not i would highly recommend betula for very comfy quality made casual sandals perfect for the beach or casual summer wear i am a self professed shoe addict these are great for those days you want only comfort	23
0	i purchased two units one for our home and one for our vacation home within a few days the unit at home was no longer making good crema the water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses i'm sending both units back and buying another brand if they had worked properly i'm not sure i would have like them even then the design of this unit is odd i 've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird if you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew the grounds and steam explode all over i also suspect that the thermostat is broken it allows the water to boil which does not make tasty coffee overall i hate this unit i'm going back to shopping	23
0	i am the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card 16 mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough ! read on ! if you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory this is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible \( because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card \) looking further on p13 it states choosing slideshow frequency note this function applies to photos stored on all media page 27 in faq states 2 \) q can i switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards \? a yes when you connect your memory card to photoframe \( tm \) it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card finally the quick start guide faq states q can i switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards \? a yes digital photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected clearly the three references i provide indicate that the dpf can operate slideshows from a media card in reality slideshows from media cards does not work philips how about a firmware upgrade \? i bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures i was planning on sending preloaded cards to her all she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on \( mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets \) do not buy this dpf for older none computer savvy people since media card can not be used you have to use the internal memory for slideshows the internal 16mb memory can hold about 70 pictures that 's it it is also unclear the maximum size a file can be i believe the internal memory converts the file to a dpf friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card \( how is mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed \? \) why have media card slots if they are useless \? internal memory is way too small ! do not buy and save yourself the hassle	23
0	this gamecube is weak i have owned both the nes and the nintendo 64 and those were excellent gaming systems nintendo 's recent system the gamecube has several problems with it 's design first of all the internal fan is slow but quiet after an hour or so of use the system overheats thus shuts down second problem the wireless controllers for this system suck we have tried 4 brands and none have worked more than a week the brands we have tried pelican intec nintendo and osmart the third problem is that the system was not built to last i still have the nes and nintendo 64 which both work great ! i doubt the gamecube will last past 4 5 years of use simply put don't buy this product ! also ! the nintendo wii is going to come out soon from the description and from the specs you will need to stand up and interact \( move around and stuff \) with the game sounds fun but would you like to do that after a hard day of work \? it will work something like the sony eye toy	23
1	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly it snaps on and off easily angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser	23

1	eventually anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories first you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter and probing into the nature of evil sometimes they go the supernatural route \( the exorcist rosemary 's baby do n't look now \) sometimes they stay grounded \( psycho henry portrait of a serial killer se7en \) either way they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening you acknowledge that what you 've seen has struck a kind of nerve but you wo n't lose much sleep these movies are intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror on the other hand the second breed of quality horror movies has no interest in psychology in the nature of their content and do not attempt to intellectually engage you they only want to make you feel as if you are in immediate danger the movies that fall into this category \( halloween alien \) do not provide food for thought but they know how to make you uncomfortable and they know how to push your buttons they are manipulative in the extreme but they are actively frightening and provide visceral experiences that the previous category of horror films cannot finally the third category of superlative horror films distinguish themselves by remaining conscious of themselves they want to frighten you but they also want to convince you that they are above merely pushing your buttons at the same time they do n't want to go the intellectual route either these films \( scream dawn of the dead \) are made by people who know the genre know that the audience knows the genre and toe a thin line between adhering to genre conventions and examining those conventions explicitly these films are very effective even if they are too cool for the room you laugh knowingly and then bam something truly frightening wipes that smirk right off your face bernard rose 's candyman is a rarity in that it falls into all three of these categories it is intellectually stimulating and it knows a great deal about the nature of evil but it is also truly viscerally frightening it is self aware and yet it is not too cool for the room and there is no comfortable distance to be found from the nightmare that unfolds on the screen it is as immediately frightening as the orginal halloween it is as thought provoking as the exorcist and it is as aware as itself as the scream trilogy you 've never seen anything quite like it before and you probably wo n't see anything like it again the plot of candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force \( the cabrini green housing projects in chicago which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation \) in search of discovering the source of the legend of the candyman a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times she is convinced as any liberal pseudo sociologist might be that the candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang drug related violence the fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the candyman reinforces this conviction for this woman the idea that there is evil in the world pure evil unconditioned by economic racial \( most of the residents of cabrini green are poor and black \) factors is unthinkable she does not believe that the candyman is anything more than an idea she is wrong the candyman is real and he does n't much like the challenge to his authority posed by her skepticism furthermore she reminds him of someone from his past whom he wishes to be reunited with and thus he comes to view her as a conquest on more levels than one for about half of the film we follow the woman played by virginia madsen and her friend played by kasi lemmons as they trek through cabrini exchange notes and conduct the affairs of their lives madsen 's grad student is no different from a lot of young people she is determined to make a mark on her field she 's a little suspicious about her husband 's fidelity she smokes she 's pretty she 's intelligent and she seems nice enough she draws our sympathy however midway through the film there is a decisive rupture and everything in madsen 's life begins to unravel at an alarming rate the chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from soon everything we have come to know about the young woman we 've been following all of the connections she has to her friends to her husband to humanity in general seem to be undone it would be unfair to describe exactly what happens but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of candyman are as frightening as anything i 've seen on film we thought we were safe after all the character we 'd been following had friends family a job a life of her own the possibility of coming into conflict with nothing less than pure evil was the farthest thing from her mind she and her friend were more concerned about packing the requisite mace for their journey through the projects more afraid of drug dealers than of demons after all the candyman is an urban legend and we know all about urban legends they 're campfire stories there is no boogeyman not really rose plays on the self conscious approach we take to horror films by decisively arguing that it will not save us he engages us intellectually by toying with the idea of whether the candyman is literally real or only becomes literally real if enough people are afraid of him \( i 'll leave that up to you to decide \) and he frightens us at an immediate level by pulling the rug out from under us at a crucial moment and by never allowing us to regain our footing it does n't hurt that he has an uncanny eye for frightening visuals \( the bees swallowing the chicago skyline the candyman 's self portrait \) plus the help of a terrific soundtrack from philip glass \( whose presence reminds us that hey this is a serious piece of art \) and compelling performances on all levels not to mention a great idea and yes the ability to push our buttons and manipulate us when he wants to candyman is as far as i'm concerned the second most frightening film ever made the original halloween still remains the only movie that made me briefly fear for my own safety but i would argue that the horror genre has produced no more complete work of art no other film that engages the viewer on every conceivable level they could ask to be engaged on than rose 's masterpiece halloween becomes exponentially less scary with repeated viewings as you begin to get the sequence down and figure out what 's coming candyman 's power remains undiminished even once you get the sequence down because the scares give way to the ideas do n't miss it rated r contains some very graphic gore \( nothing that will really surprise those used to the genre but this movie does get pretty ugly by any standard seriously who said this was n't gory enough \? \) some language and brief nudity \( not in a sexual context \)	23
1	a wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it it is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity as a big fan of greer garson i must comment on jane bedinger 's review in which she claimed that ms garson was having an affair with the actor who played her son ms garson fell in love with and married richard ney about a year after the movie was made i do n't see how ms bedinger could consider this an affair	23

1	had great expectations for the expensive subscription you get some really great coverage of neat hardware hacking stuff happening out there \( and available on the web \) the how to make stuff takes many many unnecessary pages get the feel that they are trying to fill the pages with large photo spreads still has a way to go before it becomes a successful combination of wired magazine elektor electronics and hardware hack websites would definitely like more stuff like making an xyz mill router instead of a feature on the mit fab lab in spite of all the above i have renewed the pricey subscription am still hoping	23
0	i have read baldacci 's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them this one however is just awful not only the character 's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie the only thing i can think of to compare it to is this there was a series of calvin and hobbes cartoons where calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows with lame lines like the gun was loaded and so was i that is exactly what this book is like except it goes on for 400 pages there is n't a single interesting character in this book in my opinion you just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end it 's the bataan death march of novels i hope this is an aberration i 'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that i read were so good but one more stinker like this one and i 'll drop his name from my reading list	23
1	wonderful cycling magazine for everyday riders the content is very well rounded covering racing touring commuting recreational cycling and mountain biking this magazine does n't just focus on how to make you faster or how to get you to buy the newest greatest lightest 8000 carbon bike most of the equipment the magazine tests is geared for regular folks who can afford reasonable prices the only problem i have is the price in the u s	23
1	we had a canon powershot s50 3 years ago loved it so this time when my husband wanted to buy another digital compact camera we specifically looked for canons we originally were thinking of getting the sd700 800 or something like that but after we compared these cameras together in a store near us we found out sd900 has the finest lcd display more opitions in control panel so we came back and bought it from amazon \( our favorite online store \) we used it in our last trip to grand cayon lv sf etc this sd900 takes very good pictures especially in good lighting conditions colors are also smooth and rich the downside as you may already read from others' reviews no battery indication no raw \( it 's ok my husband does n't do much editiing anyway it will be too much to ask for a campact camera to offer \) control panel is sensitive do n't get frustrated if you happened to pressed the wrong button and could n't figure the way out during the time of shooting stich is a great function which comes with but when in a very bright area you can not see the stich alignment very well on the lcd screen \( i guess it 's a common trouble to all digital compact cameras which are relay on lcd dispay \) overall it 's a wonderful camera we love it it 's my husband 's camera i uses canon 350d but i borrow it from my husband sometimes because it 's tiny compares to my 10 lbs moose and it takes very good pictures	23

1	i purchased this kit primarily for the extra battery which retails for about what i paid for this item having the backup battery is great but i was pleasantly suprised by the soft case it protects my dsc p200 without being bulky or heavy with the camera being so small it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money the case for the memory sticks is nice as well it is easy to lose a stick if it 's just floating around and the case keeps them securely all in all this is an excellent value	23

1	i am a huge thomas hardy fan and i was not disappointed with this book at first all the technical astronomical information was slow but the love story started and that was forgotten my only complaint about two on a tower is the ending it seems very rushed everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages it was n't realistic for viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later considering she was only 33 at the end of the story sir constantine was possessive jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him the bishop was full of himself how is that worse \? a few years with him and all of a sudden she 's an old woman with a heart condition \? swithin comes back and says he 'll marry her she 's overcome with joy and boom ! she dies in his arms i also find it strange that neither swithin or viviette acknowledged that the boy was his did n't people in the village realize who he looked like since people were already suspicious of the lovers \? what will happen next swithin takes his son in and marries tabitha lark \? a very good sad complicated romance	23

1	i ca n't get enough of okami ! i 've beaten it and am started on a second play though any action rpg game fan has to at least try this game ! the title basically says it all it is a typically japanese play on words since depending on how you translate it okami can mean either wolf or king of the gods for those people to whom that is not enough information to really understand the game here are the basics 100 years before the game 's beginning a huge 8 headed dragon monster called the orochi menaced the small village of kamiki after suffering orochi 's tyranny for years the village 's champion nagi and a white wolf the village dubbed shiranui defeated the orochi shiranui died from his wounds after the fight and the village built a shrine for him peace reigned for 100 years until the evil suddenly and mysteriously reappeared you control shiranui reborn in a quest to save the land from the evil you travel all over the land of nippon \( which is japanese for japan how original \) fighting monsters helping people and healing nature of the curse of evil the story is nothing new and is both very linear and quite predictable but it is very well done mixing japanese mythology into a classic hero story with a generous helping of humor to give it flavor the story has one major downside though it is told through cut scenes that contain bucket loads of exposition you will often find yourself button mashing x desperately to try to speed things along and that does not work very well because the important cut scenes do n't let you speed up the dialogue for instance the very first cut scene that opens the game literally takes at least 15 minutes to get through before you can get to the action most of the rest are not nearly that long but several of them do take a good 5 minutes at least to say that it gets tedious is an understatement still the cell shaded graphics largely make up for the tedious cut scenes they are done in a very beautiful yet simplistic style that evokes a traditional japanese ink painting despite the simple style though the level of detail is outstanding in fact it is so detailed that there is the occasional spot of graphical slowdown this game really pushes the hardware of the ps2 to its limits the music and sound are also fantastic most of the music evokes traditional japanese art as much as the graphics do while the sound effects range from wolf barks and footfalls to wind blowing gently through trees and more the mood is always set perfectly for whatever environment you 're visiting except possibly with the voices rather than real voices people talk in a form of gibberish that sounds like someone trying to talk underwater while it does not bother me personally some people simply can not listen to these voice effects either you 'll hate the voice noises with a passion or you wo n't care at all either way this is not a good point for the game the controls take a bit of getting used to but when you have gotten used to them they become second nature unlike the legend of zelda games there is no enemy lock on during combat instead you automatically target the closest monster \( s \) when you push the attack button this simplifies combat without turning it into a button mashing cake walk it works perfectly unless you get hit by the controller bug yes a bug in the game thankfully rare as i only encountered it twice in 60 hours of game play still when it happens it is extremely annoying during combat while you 're wailing away on a monster the options menu will suddenly open for no reason usually the analog control on your controller will also go crazy either just turning off or madly flickering on and off either case makes the game impossible to play of course since you control your in game avatar with the left analog stick the first case is easy to fix just turn the analog control back on and exit the menu in the second case you can only fix it by literally unplugging the controller and then plugging it back in far more common than the controller bug are the load times they usually are not terrible but it seems like a loading screen comes up at least every five minutes or so between these and the long cut scenes you might sometimes wonder if there is actually any game play included but there is game play and it is a lot of fun there is a great deal to keep you occupied from the compelling story line to the many treasure hunts races puzzles and mini games between fighting to save the world you can go fishing feed animals catch thieves and a lot more plus after you beat the game once it unlocks lots of extras including image galleries and the sound track all of that and the wonderful atmosphere definitely make this a game worth checking out rent it before you buy it if possible to make sure you can deal with the long cut scenes numerous load times and weird voice effects but if you are a fan of action rpgs like legend of zelda you will definitely want to add okami to your game library summary pros great story great graphics great music sound wonderful atmosphere lots of culture and mythology to give it flavor plentiful activities and mini games unlockable extras after beating the gamecons occasional graphic slowdown too much exposition tedious cut scenes lots of load times rare controller bugneutral voice noises that you might or might not hateover all score five stars of fun fun fun ! but three stars over all because of the many problems	23
1	i am married to a native new yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions many of which we still visit today as an extra bonus for avid cooks there are recipes for anyone who remembers luchows or any of the other venerable now closed restaurants the book mentions it will take you back to happy times and good memories it 's an excellent book and clearly schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love	23
1	i just made a long trip from miami florida all the way to s carolina with a explorist xl loaded with directroute v3 everything worked just fine i installed the software unlock it upload the maps all with out any problems the unit was very fast and accuracy did n't need to keep it over the dashboard from inside the vehicle worked very well never took more than a minute to track all satellites the street route where very accurate never got lost working with poi 's was very simple did n't have any problem handling very large maps i really recommend this unit	23
0	i bought the avent bottles when i was pregnant because they were babiesrus 's best pick yeah right ! i wonder how many are returned on a daily basis aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking ! i would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money	23
1	my wife and i \( yep a guy reviewing a kids toy ! \) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece she is absolutely hooked on it having a relatively short attention span with most toys it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy ! the big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well when she gets bored learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy ! ! playing is easy you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now with my wife 4 months pregnant we have ordered another already only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note \( red tentacle ! \)	23

1	i bought these clear color version as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer according to the gift recipient they 're excellent they really do n't leak or fog up he was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that did n't get any water in his eyes \( but please note he does n't swim for more than one half hour at a time so i ca n't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity \) he also said that the fit is very good and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types for the price these are an excellent bargain	23
0	i bought this movie because of charlotte alexandra i had seen her in a really good movie with charlotte rampling called the pool she was beautiful to watch and played well against one of my favorite actresses charlotte rampling a real young girl on dvd was of low quality and did n't make sense to me i can not recommend it some scenes were just gross it was not even a little sexy it was sophomoric i did follow amazon 's suggestion and also bought two other movies romance frivolous lola romance was good but a little dis jointed and needlessly explicit in some parts and not explicit enough in other parts the other characters were flat and empty frivolous lola was hilarious explicit sexy and fun even if it was a little dated i will see this movie again with friends just to laugh	23

0	okay maybe i should have read the laundering instructions which say to machine wash and then drip dry but who makes baby items that ca n't be machine dried \? how many parents have the time to line dry delicates \? the upshot is that this fell apart melted in the dryer and got fluff all over everywhere the first time we ever washed it if you need something you can throw in the washer dryer when it gets dirty and not worry about sorting this is not your product grrr	23
1	the bushnell powerview 12x25 is a fine small pocket sized binocular since my wife is an avid bird watcher we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell that we used for trips so i researched then bought this one from amazon for her birthday she loves it the viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact which makes it easy to pack for vacations yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country we both highly recommend this and other bushnell products	23

1	sadly as a rule i have no great interest in history but ms behrman 's approach brings the person of thomas jefferson to life in a way that appeals to all ages she puts personality and emotion into her writing which makes potentially dull facts dates and events brim with energy this is a wonderful series and she does it justice in every way	23
1	the only problem with betty buckley is that she is n't nearly as well known as she deserves to be considering the length and quality of her career this album of somgs from her 1996 aids benefit concert at carnegie hall is simply flawless naturally it 's heavy on music from broadway the london stage and film scores but she sings one mary chapin carpenter song quot come on come on quot that comes from none of those sources and is guaranteed to give you chills every time you hear it if you 're tired of recordings by singers of little talent and less style listen to betty buckley for fifteen minutes and you 'll feel as if you 'd never heard real singing before she is an original and she has the best voice in theater of this or almost any decade	23
0	the material and ergonomics of this phone is average the selling point of this phone for me is its ability to connect up to 10 handsets using one phone line below are the factors that i considered before purchasing and my experience range the range of the phone is very good i can be 80 100 feet away from the base unit and the call signal will stay constant and not drop call quality average i have a plantronics cs50 wireless headset that is on the 900 mhz frequency connected to a corded base unit the call quality on the wireless headset is crystal clear when i have switched during mid conversation from the handset to headset or vice versa callers have noted a significant difference in the clarity of the call the uniden is much more muffled and less clear it is however comparable to most cordless phone not exceptional but not bad durability average i have dropped my handsets on rare occasions they survived the drops onto the carpet quite well one of the handset did drop onto my hardwood floor which cracked the screen but the force was not significant and it did n't scratch the hardwood floor special note i suffered a power outage during a major windstorm the base unit will not boot up this appears to have happened to other reviewers this problem appears to have afflicted only this piece of electronic in my whole house on this issue i have to drop my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars	23
1	this item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container the beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer 's instructions and baking in an oven the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces drawers however larger spaces may require more than one overall this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container \( s \) i would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted	23
0	i had a kodak camera for years that i absolutely loved we took it ice skating and ended up falling on it therefore my family bought me this sony for my b day and i have to say this is the worst camera i have ever owned if you have any movement \( such as action shots or small children \) the picture always comes out blurry what a pain ! also the picture quality is horrible i will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a kodak	23
0	my motorola c139 with net10 crashed on me i called net10 and they promptly sent me out a new phone except they sent me this flip phone \( v171 \) i liked my candy bar phone and did n't want this flip piece of junk i was happy with net10 service up to the point of my old phone failing and then things quickly went downhill net10 would not transfer my number to the replacement phone even though i had minutes available on the old phone i gave my wife the v171 to use and took back from her our cingular phone which works awesome with no problems she had problems all the time with the v171 she had to always type in the area codes for all numbers dialed even the local numbers she also had problems trying to dial a number and the phone would not dial after pressing all the numbers in the phone and hitting send in my opinion the v171 is completely worthless overall i am a very dissatisfied customer my recommendation is to stay away from this phone and this service go shop cingular for all the great deals they have	23
0	i have n't recieved a single copy so i ca n't really review it all i can say is the amazom service is terrible	23
0	it 's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick clean near perfect minimalist thriller it 's not that much of the added material \( particularly the internal affairs sub plot \) feels tacked on and unnecessary it 's not even that pacino 's character is a toned down shell of the dangerously off kilter detective of the original that one of the more complicated characters \( fr ya selmer tanya francke \) has been reduced down to set dressing or that the ending ruins the film 's moral atmosphere it 's the fact that nolan a sublimely talented director is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads pacino does the method acting bit again taking it over the top in every single scene hilary swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down to earth hometown girl and robin williams well he 's robin williams the kids in this film katharine isabelle and jonathan jackson turn in fine performances that while hardly career makers \( which they could n't be considering how far their roles have been pared down \) are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging see the film for their far too short performances but make sure you rent it and do n't pay too much to do so	23
1	my 16 month old loves her new groceries the produce amp amp sandwich parts are plastic amp amp each piece has a wonderful texture the canned goods are very interesting to read they are actually labeled by a supermarket in the uk so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the us i put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older she has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate this was a great purchase	23

1	as a classic seattle tea this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea when i drink this tea i am home again this tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of seattle in one cup this is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors you can sweeten this more if you like with stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness it is good with a touch of muscovado sugar from india tree the rebecca review	23

0	i bought this coffee maker to try and get above the level of cheap coffeemakers i did not succeed i paid 50 and could have bought a 20 mr coffee and saved myself a lot of my money this is not a top of the line coffee maker with bottomline features it is a bottomline coffee maker with bottomline features it has no clock no timer no automatic turnoff \( it will cook the pot dry if you forget to turn it off it is hard to fill to the correct level without having water run out the hole in the reservoir at the back it is hard to pour a cup of coffee without cascades of dribbles you are supposed to be able to take a cup out as it is brewing in a word do n't it just keeps drooling coffee all over the heating element and it takes forever to brew a pot of coffee i am not an engineer just a harried housewife that is trying to get everything together in the morning and get everyone where they need to go this coffeemaker should have never made it to the marketplace if you want a basic coffeemaker get a mr coffee for 20 this is not what you are looking for there is nothing deluxe about this coffee maker except the profit they are making off of consumers like me	23
1	i have the same opinion as everyone else the controller is very convenient appealing affordable and fun but it suddenly stopped working i think there are some problems with the wireless connection and its very frustrating being in the middle of the action and boom your controller stops respondind and you get killed it sucks ! ! ! i see that a lot of people have the same problem that i do what i do to solve it is changing the batteries and then putting them back again or use the dual shock for a while and then plug the logitech again that has worked for me it sounds silly but somehow works so if you want a great wireless controller this is it but be aware that this problem is a little annoying and you probably will have it too	23

1	this movie is intimate and special some reviews say it is the story of obsession of fetishism of trivial things however this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy 's life his fantasy woman the character malena rarely speaks throughout the movie but we see her exactly how we are supposed to see her through the eyes of an old man telling the story of himself in young love this perspective makes her ideal and special with few flaws as a fantasy woman is to a young man malena is instantly a likeable character not awful and disgusting like those using her we cannot forget that our narrator renato is not actually a teenage boy but an older man telling his own story therefore he is unreliable as a narrator malena 's sins are washed clean through his judgement and we believe him when we see her victimized by the other women however renato has had years to think about everything to contemplate what really happened to her so in the end the people who use her are completely despicable unable to garner any liking of course she is a victim but she eventually falls into the gossip that others believe she is guilty of with the men the movie does offer a hint that she could have escaped all of the problems she is from another city and her husband for most of the movie is dead yet she chooses to not escape but to stay and her fate is sealed the music in the movie was nominated for best score in 2000 and it is beautiful emotional it truly adds to the feeling of the movie i would recommend this movie to anyone for the compelling story emotion and characters you will never forget this movie	23
1	i normally do n't write reviews but after owning several toasters in the past and being very disappointed i just had to write about this one i owned an old toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years it never did brown evenly but was a workhorse until finally the bread crumb tray broke got my money 's worth i have done a lot of research on toasters on epinions amazon and others and many people have n't been very happy with toasters they have bought costing nearly 300 00 \( dualit \) toastmaster ge rival dualit most kitchenaid and sunbeam models were poorly rated i found one review on this sunbeam \( this is their top of the line model the chrome and black model costs more but currently not in production \) and the person really really liked it so i ordered this from amazon directly this was the very lowest price i could find order something else so as to get their free shipping ! ! ! \( over 25 00 \) so what happened when i got it got the toaster plugged it in dropped two slices of bread in and excitedly waited for my toast a few minutes passed then pop ! its done or so i thought when the toast came out it was brown only on one side the other side poorly toasted this goes for both slices right then and there i was ready to send this thing back well had been busy that week and continued using it day after day each day was as disappointing as the first then after a little over a week the bread started toasting uh well perfectly ! ! ! after owning this for nearly 4 months it still browns evenly on both sides of each piece of bread crisp on the outside soft on the inside i do n't know why it started working right would n't think that it would need to be broken in to work right i am so glad that i did n't send this back right after the first several toastings procrastinating worked out in my best interest for the first time i have not tried bagels in this do n't like bagels but it does well for what i bought it for i think the style is rather funky but many people have liked its looks if this toaster works for you as good as it has for me i think you will like it ! ! ! if it does n't work well right out of the box you might give it a few days maybe the toast fairy will bless you too	23
1	i have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months \( including cingular htc 8125 and nokia e62 \) and can safely say that this is the best phone i have owned the palm operating system is much easier to use than the windows operating system \( albeit less powerful \) and much more customizable and synchronization friendly than the symbian os its great for easy installation of software pros very customizable interface making the phone very user friendly you can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button palm os is easy to use and thus you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone unlike windows mobile which is definantly more powerful than palm os but cumbersome and difficult to use at times you can use this as a one handed phone very important for people like me who like to drive and text email perfect size weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear the lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement easy synchronization with your outlook mailbox or with the palm desktop can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you which is very useful \( although limits battery life \) cons battery life is somewhat worse than other phones i have to charge my phone every night and i probably use about 15 minutes of internet 30 minutes of mp3 player autoretrieve email every 30 min and 2 hour talk time as well as some other palm functions if you have it set on auto retrieve for your email the battery life seems to decrease impressively the newer manufactured 680s have a fix installed for this problem apparently you cant plug in your own headsets into the device \( like your ipod headphones \) you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from palm i hate that i suggest buying this phone unlocked from palm instead of from cingular i got it for 350 with a 1g sd card and stereo headphones included also if you get it from cingular they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone overall extremely satisfied with this easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery life	23
1	i have an older version of this charger that i bought in the mid 90 's i used it to maintain my garaged mustang 's battery over the winter months for many years i made a cigarette lighter adapter so all i needed to do was to plug it in instead of using the alligator clips i have to say this thing is dead reliable ! it always kept my battery in prime condition i love it and recommend it highly	23
0	this is a simple drawing program much like paint do n't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover it only does black and white and it has no help in drawing manga figures and it is a stripped down program at that the documentation is for the full program so you ca n't do much of what you read in the manual and help files save your money this program is n't worth buying	23

0	this edition of the film sucks and sucks again the wide screen version of this is a masterpiece without the widescreen ratio this edition cannot be true to the comic book sensibility that bava intended each shot was carefully composed \( and not intended to be butchered \) this edition is a travesty especially when it 's purported to be put out by fans do you 're homework there are also scenes missing from this print scenes that are important and add to the overall ambience hey i thought the folks behind this were enthusiasts instead its just sloppy and self indulgent look for the earlier laser disc edition as for the extras do we really need the it 's great because i used it in my video slop and it 's great because i did a bad homage rip off slop the documentary in the extras takes great pains to point out that this film was intended to look like a comic book and that 's what was great about it then when you watch the film what you get is less than a third of the original image ! strikes me a total scumminess all in a all a fabulous opportunity wasted by a few lazy lard asses with a quick fix mentality	23

1	fable was a much anticipated rpg that promised 40 50 hours of gamer action in the storyline and complete control over the life of the protagonist we waited for this game for what seemed like a lifetime and the build up for the game to finally arrive was almost more than rpg lovers could take but did it live up to the hype \? no my fellow gamers and it hurts me so to say it while the game promised to deliver several hours of stoyline play i was shocked when i completed the main storyline in less than 20 hours now i'm not one to doubt the sacred words of lionhead studios so i dedicated another 20 hours of my life to uncover different aspects of gameplay such as getting married changing outfits and body types becoming divinely evil or majestically good \( ect \) but it was all just so linear ! the paths were set the storyline already thought out and the character chosen you were n't given enough to keep the interest going i later dragged myself back to the game to play the storyline through again and though i admit that i enjoyed the game much more the second time through i just found myself not caring about it all too many options were closed and the darn story was just too short ! ! the darker elements of the game were simply addicting such as the colleseum the prison \( which i played over and over and over \) and the story of your sister but it seems as though the people in charge of developing such side stories \( which we all so love ! ! ! \) got a little case of a d d now i'm not saying to avoid this game it 's got just what some gamers may need to get into rpg 's but for those of us who were expecting a game to completely pwn morrowind well let 's just move on or wait for a better thought our sequal crosses fingers	23
1	i bought this watch two months back and am using it as a casual watch but it would go with a formal dress even works as promised i have tried synching this watch in two countries three signalling stations and several time zones and it works perfectly well to quote the cons it is a bit chunky but that 's ok since i'm using it as a casual watch the back of the watch is plastic which makes it look cheap but do n't know if there is any specific reason for that also it would 've gratified my every needs had there been an 'indiglo' or 'nightglo' feature in complete darkness the irradiating hands look fine but if it is half light then i have to spend a second or two searching for the hands these are minor things and i am a perfectionist so here i stamp 4 stars on it	23

1	great idea to hang clothes the hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on if your child is like mine who loves to dress and re dress dolls the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits the price is great now i paid 20 great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer	23
0	these were a sticky mess in the bag the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap they were also soft and seemed stale great ingredients but the final product was disappointing	23
0	well i ordered this online as we could n't find any window mounted feeders locally it 's lasted exactly two weeks the problem is the extremely weak design the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups as this has there are somewhat strange instructions with this model directing the user to quot rub quot the suction cups for several minutes in order to \( supposedly \) build up a proper quot suction quot then the glass slides into a groove well the thing worked at first until i had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it i did it as gingerly as i could not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups refilled it \( only halfway ! \) and replaced it about 4 minutes went by and then the entire thing glass suction cups everything fell to our deck breaking into a million thick glass shards frustrating me the hummers and our two dogs banished from the outside until i could clean up this mess what a crummy product ! and overpriced although i would n't buy it again for two cents beware	23

0	i received my granos as a birthday present two years ago as had already been reported here the machine is great when it works i thought i was the only one who had leak problems but most everyone who wrote a review here reported the same problem leak from the bottom and leak from the water container i called customer service to report the problem and they sounded like they 've never heard of the problem they asked me to return the machine but i did n't bother a good customer service should have already heard the problem before customers call a 600 espresso machine should last more than two years i ca n't believe a company like bodum is not concerned about its product i'm buying another espresso machine and it 's not going to be bodum again	23
0	this watch stinks crappy manual the band is so big it could fit around my leg and when i received it it didn't work now i have to pay extra to fix the band and to get it working so much for what i thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch i would 've given it no stars if i could don't make the same mistake i did avoid this watch	23

0	my son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long he wasnt the tiniest baby i tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he 's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing it 's the worst product ever i am definitely not using it and will probably donate it to goodwill	23
1	i hate to use this word but this product truly is orgasmic it comes out perfect cup after cup having a creamy yet zingy taste the first time i tried it was at einstein bros bagels \( the use the concentrate themselves to create quot their quot chai tea latte \) when i first tried this i exclaimed to myself quot wow ! ! ! ! quot any person i have ever served this to was willing to vouch that their tastebuds were in sheer ecstasy mr oregon chai tea latte concentrate thank you	23

1	i have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere but i did want to say to potential readers that the peggy antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women 's movement that as such it fills a long felt want and that it is to be recommended to those new to unfamiliar with or who feel they should be allied with the women 's movement it would it will make an excellent text for those doing women 's studies as to those doing social movement studies whether globally or more locally summarising antrobus shows the women 's movement as political as recognising women 's relationship to social conditions as processal as posed against patriarchal privilege as beginning where and when women recognise their separateness and even their alienation marginalisation isolation or abandonment within wider movements for social justice or transformation one complaint but which is much more widely spread than in this book alone this is the avoidance of the word `capitalism' even by feminists who are or were once socialists capitalism does not even get an index reference in antrobus capitalists mostly after all male white and patriarchal call it capitalism and are proud of it so why cannot it not be so named by feminists who could and surely should condemn it \? this cannot be solely because of their justified criticism of the archaic political economic determinism of patriarchal socialists so it has to be due to either a desire to be salonf hig \( acceptable in the salons within which they have been speaking to the funders they are dependent upon \) or a restriction of their utopia to a kinder gentler global capitalism a global neo keynesian order for which no convincing feminist case has been made pity	23
0	this is a good example of the kind of scope astronomers warn beginners away from the first red flag is the ridiculously high advertised magnification of 600x do you know what you will see at 600x in this scope \? nothing but a dim blur note that the objective \( main \) lens is 60mm all telescope optics have inherent limitations maximum useful magnification per millimeter of aperture is about 2x therefore with any attempt to use this scope at magnification of over 120 140x the increase in image size will be more than offset by breakdown and that 's even assuming the quality of the objective lens is any good the finder is useless a 6x30 is barely adequate and this is not even that big finding any object other than the moon will be an exercise in frustration the 1 1 4 size of the eyepiece is creditable but too high a mignification for this scope and the field of view is in doubt and do n't even think of using the barlow buy this scope and after a few outings it will most likely sit in the attic the review immediately before mine is correct this is no way to get started in astronomy in a way it is hard to fault celestron for making and marketing this scope their upper tier instruments are quite good but the big money appears to be made on mass market toys like this in one sense the sale of these scopes subsidizes their good models just make sure gentle reader to stay away from the toys using an astronomical telescope is not like playing an mp3 file and but rather like playing a guitar it is a learned skill and you must do a lot of homework before you buy a telescope buying without prior experience is like buying a car without knowing anything about driving if you want to see the wonders of the sky contact your local astronomy club and attend one of their star parties the members love sharing their hobby and can set you straight as to how to get started the best way is to learn the sky with the unaided eye and 10x50 binoculars \( decent ones are available on this website \) then graduate to something along the lines of a 150 200mm \( 6 8 \) dobsonian celestron 's own 6 starhopper can be found on amazon for under 290 for more information on buying telescopes see my encyclopedic guide on amazon so you want to buy a telescope	23
1	i wear it almost everyday and it 's a lot of fun to change out the wrist band	23
1	this watch was great i really loved the digital feature residing in the analog face i do n't know about others out there but analog watches are the only way to go i love the fact that i can visually see what time it is in a graphical representation but i love having the digital features such as the alarm timer stopwatch and date feature i wore the watch 24 7 and it never ever gave me a problem however when i was filming an independent film within a west texas silo i lost the watch climbing the ladder out i was climbing a straight vertical steel pipe ladder and as i reached the top hatch which lead to the top landing my watch face caught on the side of the steel ladder and the band pins broke next thing i knew i heard a plop and new my wonderful watch was on its way to the bottom of a 120 foot watery depth ! ! i will probably get another one but i really would love one with a metal band	23
0	what a chore this book was to read if it were n't for my ocd about finishing books that i start i would 've read the first couple of chapters and then given up it seems like a wannabe suspense but it 's not it seems like there might be a love story in it but there 's not it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it but there is not what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she 's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy she tries to make a connection but falls way short read vinegar hill that one was worth it pass midnight champagne by	23
1	i bought this for my 2 dogs it works great cleans up easily ! the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it 's large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home it does n't fit under my kitchen sink faucet i do n't have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer \( wish i did \) \) otherwise it would be a snap to fill i have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs the container is really heavy once it 's full my only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one \( 2 gallon or 1 gallon \) waterer it would be easier to handle i also bought the 5 gallon feeder i love it ! it holds a whole 5lb bag of food which is great ! so get the larger feeder the smaller waterer oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it !	23
1	after reading some of the reviews i felt compelled to share my experience with this product i love it ! i'm not sure if they made a different model before but mine has an on off switch that works just fine \( its on the back \) its not rocket science if you follow the directions i never have problems with the bottle floating if you put the bottle in first and then fill the warmer with water like the directions tell you to then the bottle wo n't float the warmer itself has a chart on it that tells you how long to leave the bottle in the warmer and at what setting it also has a light that flashes on and off when the warmer has reached a constant temperature there are no dings or timers but that has n't presented any problems for me overall this product does what it is supposed to do and it does it well as a first time mom i highly recommend it	23
1	the product arrived quickly and i like this product but because we live in south texas it was melted and had to be put in the refrigerator	23
1	once in a while movie gem reaches out and touches your soul i have added this film to my collection of favorites and those i will savor when i need a gut wrenching cry i was literally emotionally drained after watching it the story is set in hell 's kitchen among the despair of poverty and addictions a young irish couple with their two daughters move to the neighborhood to try to establish a new life overshadowed by the loss of their son at five years old i find myself drawn in the family deeply sharing their anguish and triumphs one scene had me on the edge of my seat at a street fair when the father is trying to win an et doll for his youngest daughter i wo n't tell you the outcome the youngest daughter ariel has a spirit about her a curiosity and charisma which brings caring people into the fold of the family she is bold and unafraid yet she yearns for the love of her father who is emotionally distant following the death of his son the oldest daughter kristine is wise beyond her years she successfully camptures life on her camcorder which she uses constantly almost a video diary if you will the mother is strong and loves her husband with all her heart her husband has shut her out of his emotionbal life also and she struggles to deal with that she is the glue which binds her family together their neighbor the screaming man of the building is a tormented young artist the words on his door say it all keep away i wo n't give away the plot with his role a must see i cried i stopped for a bit i cried again i could n't stop crying okay so i cried at lion king too but that 's beside the point i loaned this movie to my neighbor immediately after with red puffy eyes she understands	23
1	consisting entirely of descriptions of fantastical cities supposedly reported by marco polo to kublai khan calvino 's fiction is sui generis a completely original mixture of fable and philosophy that is even more imaginative than his more critical theory oriented if on a winter 's night a traveler this is the kind of novel borges might have written a celebration of the unbridled imagination invisible cities is also i am convinced a secret love letter to a single city the imaginary dream city of venice a place that exists partly as its own reflection in the sea	23

0	i'm not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the season 1 2 box sets which is how you 're better off seeing them \( at least they 're in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes \) instead i will be focusing on the bonus features not the violent femmes music video because that too can be found on the season 1 box set but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features i love the interviews and the in studio voice recording re enactments but i hate how every piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame you can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen and even then it is n't clear as there 's a bubble shine over it i 'd love for paramount nick to include all of the original non bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2	23

1	i have had my handspring visor deluxe for 5 yes five years \( actually longer \) while i take decent care of it it has taken care of me my doctor has one too exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to i finally ordered a new pda with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it \( i'm not selling it good karma \) down to business the handspring visor deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore but in its day it was great product and if you do n't need the bells and whistles \( or color display \) go for this totally flawless people often complain about the styli of other pdas no complaints here not only is it relatively comfortable it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends \( does n't break \) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device i literally lost my original stylus just a few days ago the display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun \( heck a good deal of the new ones do n't have ir \) go for it and for the price i just saw it listed for on amazon \( 85 \) it 's a total steal great product	23
1	i played atmosfear the harbingers on vhs in the mid 90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay then i saw this dvd update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down here 's my judgement 1 \) the mechanics have been simplified this has it 's pros and cons it could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components 2 \) the gatekeeper has less of a nasty funny balance in the dvd update 3 \) it is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed one reviewer seemed to think the game was boring i 'll guess instead that the people he parties with do n't have the attention span for board games too bad for them atmosfear the dvd board game get 's a b from me	23
1	i only installed the product two days ago and have not really been able to give it a solid workout that said my initial take is very positive as a writer and lousy typist i think it will increase my productivity expotentially i look forward to really getting into the nuts and bolts of the product very soon	23

1	coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small mom and pop screenprinting shop i worked at back then corel came with oodles of free fonts clipart manuals not to mention free technical support via a toll free number i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 enduring countless patches bugs and the dreaded odd numbered curse \( if you tried version 5 or 7 you feel my pain \) adobe photoshop was always my photo editing program of choice corelphotopaint just never quite did it for me industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features tools and look and feel illustrator did n't present a huge overbearing learning curve in illustrator i found the same robust features as coreldraw which was n't what impressed me about illustrator adobe 's intuitive programs and their ability to interact with one another seamlessly that is what won me over to illustrator illustrator 's ability to edit create pdf 's in their native format \? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop with layers intact \? \? \? wow ! ! ! \( i could go on \) now that being said there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's make clipping mask function the ability to customize edit add shortcut keys is an amazing feature \( again i could go on \) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications coreldraw wins hands down it boasts a robust set of import and export filters my favorite being the eps import filter which lets you import an eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import this is a must have if you work with an eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack if i had a dollar for every eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out i 'd be independently wealthy why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me so to sum it up coreldraw is a great program but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program just like in real life you need a great team this program paired with adobe creative suite meets my needs perfectly	23
0	well it is a cool product and good idea to use but the bulb was broken in first 3 days we put the second one on dont know how long this second one will last we used it only few minutes in the morning when we need to get some cloth out of closet also it is not on line product only i found bed bath beyond has it and cvs has it they sell 9 99 without extra bulb but still misleading to say online only	23

1	i have wanted to buy a musini for my son for a few years now but never found one in a retail store online or local i recently gave in and bought one gently used on ebay for a fantastic price including the cartridge my entire family loves it including my 2 year old son it was very easy to figure out how to use even without a manual on the battery case are very clear easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your musini within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the musini ! my dad could n't keep his feet still insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute i have found myself taking it out during my son 's nap time to put near me while i do the mundane chores around the house it is really addicting and keeps us all moving ! i ca n't say enough good things about this toy the music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to you also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you 're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers the songs are mostly familiar and well loved songs that you will instantly recognize i have also noticed that you can use the musini to up your child 's physical activity if you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise ! you can of course adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register it 's up to you and i think it 's fantastic ! highly recommended	23

0	i loved the first carole matthews novel i read for better or worse and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again it kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight but only because i didnt' have anything else to do i am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane i totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless there were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning to me matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her i think this is a horrible unrealistic messgage if you want to read something good pick up a jane green novel instead	23
0	i really do n't like this high chair at all my little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she cannot sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach when sitting on the regular seat she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself this is a huge pain because i have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of out to clean a 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair i have had her in friends high chairs that are a graco and she fits perfectly if i could do it over i would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly do n't buy this product !	23
0	prior to buying this phone i had heard a lot of people say that motorola 's hardware was very good but that their software left a lot to be desired nonetheless i decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan i had made the decision to switch to t mobile and this looked like one of the best phone options right off the bat i found out that the people who criticized moto 's software were right on the money there are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the least of which is the frankly idiotic way the phone book is designed eventually i made peace with all of the things i disliked about the v360 since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone as time went by i started noticing that i was missing a lot of calls the phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that i had received anywhere from minutes to hours before during the course of the last few months \( the phone is less than a year old \) i 've also found that it has begun crashing a lot opening or closing it will result in a white screen of death putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that it 's sim card cannot be found after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off with a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off at this point i am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk i am also forced to conclude that it is n't the only model which is none of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a motorola phone my wife 's motorola has shown its own host of problems people working for t mobile at several stores i have visited have confided that they never ever recommend motorola phones to anyone in fact i 've had t mobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them but rather to shop for an unlocked nokia online so that 's what i'm going to do until i can buy a new phone all i can do is recharge this phone every night restart it five or six times a day and keep apologizing to my friends family and employers for always missing their calls	23
0	i had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea i do n't know if it because i tend to like more horror type movies or what but i was really bored by them each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way i know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense the movies were violent but nothing one has n't seen before several times so i am not sure about the shock value of it i was n't shocked disturbed or upset just bored	23

1	i have tried many contact lens solutions and this one works the best for me since switching to acuvue 2 disposable lenses a couple of years ago i noticed that my eyes did not maintain their moisture as well as with my former daily wear lenses some solutions burned my eyes even after rinsing my lenses in saline but the optifree is truly different for me helping to clean my lenses daily and seemingly helping to maintain their flexibility and comfort all day although i still rinse the optifree off of my lenses with saline before wearing them i have found no irritation and even better daily rinsing and overnight storage in the optifree help me to extend the life of my disposable lenses for several weeks beyond what i could without using it that saves money because i have to purchase lenses less frequently give it a try especially at this price ! wow	23

1	i 've used the ati all in wonder remote with a make shift media center solution before and it 's been sluggish and sometimes non responsive not so for the firefly quick responsive and adaptive i also tried the cyberlink media remote not even suitable to prop up a bird food tray you 'll find cyberlink 's tech support is positively absurd their primary focus is to ask you tons of questions till you run out of patience or till they find an excuse to tell you they ca n't help you the firefly really rocks controls several programs and tools and even provides a mouse interface incase you ca n't get things just right with the application and pre defined buttons if you have a pc and want media center performance on it i 'd recommend this guy sadly the data is rf for this remote not ir i was hoping to 'absorb' all the functions of this remote into my harmony 688 but they do n't talk the same i think snapstream offers another product to talk ir for the same purposes but i'm not there yet still getting my sea legs with the firefly 's abilities	23

0	i do not think suction cup mounts work very well this one is no exception while attaching and detaching my garmin nuvii is easy enough the cup does not support the weight i was disappointed that a friction bag was not available for my nuvii however i was able to jury rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise i ordered the friction mount removed the screws on the bottom detaching the mounts that would not fit my nuvii and stapled velcro strips purchased at walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount i have been cross country using this system and it works the garmin portable friction mount for gps 010 10306 00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself	23

0	unlike most other items i 've bought from amazon i failed to read the reviews for this particular cd before purchasing being a fan of the final fantasy series i think i fell into a bit of the fanboy \( well in my case fangirl i guess \) syndrome also i did n't do my homework at all and thought this was an orchestrated recording which it most certainly is not i own most of the final fantasy ost 's \( and heartily endorse them for fans of the games \) and this particular cd does nothing new or compelling to the music tracks 1 7 are pretty much carbon copies of their ost counterparts track 8 the opening theme of ffviii \( liberi fatali \) has a very odd synth solo vocal mix covering what is in the original a very moving choral section tracks 9 11 again are basically copies of the ost track 12 alexandria \( vivi 's theme \) is the only somewhat original track as it seems to put together several pieces from the ffix soundtrack in a medley of sorts unless you are a rabid fan who must have everything ff i recommend saving up and purchasing the real ost 's instead of this disc while i do n't see non fans flocking to purchase this disc it might be worthwile if you 're only slightly interested in the series and want a taste even in that event i 'd be worried this disc would turn those people off from the series entirely pros cheap \( i paid 6 new \) track 12 is worth a listencons tracks 1 7 9 11 offer nothing much new or differenttrack 8 has creepy \( in a bad way \) synth voice mixe	23

1	i love the texture of the coffee there is no bitterness and it is very smooth to where i did n't need cream to cut the flavor i am usually not a coffee drinker but a friend told me that this is one of the best she ever had this was intended to be a christmas gift for her but out of curiosity i bought one for myself to include with the 7 bags for her i now know the difference ! believe me i had thought that instant tasted way better then real coffee until a i had a cup of this java i was almost tempted not to give the rest of the coffee away also the shipment was very fast ! i had ordered this with other items \( books and dvds \) the coffee came in within the week but the other items did n't come in at all infact every time i checked the progress amazon kept pushing the items further away in the shipment date i could n't understand this at all ! i had to cancel the rest of the order and buy the items elsewhere go figure	23
0	first of all the item is too small it is about 1 3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1 3 as wide so as you can see it is pretty small so it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again it does not make life easier good in principle but does not work	23

0	i ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements they said it would take 2 to 3 weeks its been 3 weeks when i called again they said it would take another 2 weeks how hard is it to get replacements \? \? my baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces would like to get the nursery done preferrably before my child goes to college we purposely ordered it early to give us time but apparently that wasnt enough i tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it	23
1	i bought this to cover the disintegrating cover currently on my futon it 's a beautiful print and a good color that matches my drapes but what i did n't quite understand at the time i bought it was that it 's also just one big piece of fabric no fitted edges or elastic to hold it in place kind of disappointing but since i was covering a futon i was able to tuck it around the mattress where it folds shove a wooden dowel into the crease and voila ! a great looking couch appeared so all things considered a pretty good buy for the money	23
0	we bought this for our kids for christmas of course we open the box on christmas eve at 10pm to put it together and there are no instructions ! it looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them tomorrow morning should be interesting ! merry christmas	23

1	after reading these other reviews i decided to wait a while to post a review i bought two of these chairs summer 04 and they are doing great relatively easy to put together and really sturdy they are still looking good with no issues with fading or anything my wife would make me get rid of these if there was any issue or problem with them at all i hope she does n't read this	23
1	firstly i have not seen the film adaptation of 'single white female' and so this review is n't tainted one way or the other this book about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate is written is very easy style characterizations prose and dialogue are all straightforward i can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel and the book 's feel is anything but original 'sliver' by ira levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life \( and danger \) in manhattan for a single white female still 'single white female' is an entertaining read bottom line a very enjoyable suspenseful read that does n't tax the brain recommended	23
0	originally i purchased this heavy duty case to protect my new expensive 8525 however wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up luckily the phone was not functionally damaged but i have several big dents and scratches on the case i'm going to stop using a case now since the phone is now already beat up the latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use especially since you 'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen also it took a bit getting used to to have to open the case to make a phone call the overall quality of this case is very good tho because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons i guess its a great case if you do n't wear it on your belt but i ca n't justify such a huge case if i carry it in my pocket	23

0	i used to love outburn magazine i first discovered it when i came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain the first thing i saw on the cover was vnv nation i bought that issue and soon after that i ordered a subscription what i loved about outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that are n't covered in the mainstream music magazines namely those in the goth ebm synthpop and industrial scene unfortunately within the next year and a half the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands two genres i do n't give a rat 's behind about i do n't know wtf happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music i would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to just like alternative press outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends	23
0	i got a free one year sub to another gaming mag with purchase of a game at gamestop after it ended about 6 months later i started receiving this magazine and i thought it was the same one some kind of mix up but i did n't get a magazine every month it skipped a few finally i went on their site to complain and they promised to send extra issues to make up for it i told them that there must have been a mixup then i cancelled my supposed subscription only to receive an e mail saying that now they would n't be sending me anything even the extra issues promised stay away from these people ! these people are extremely unprofessional try playstation mag instead if you have a ps i was just reccommended it	23

0	this camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position i sent the camera for warranty service \( i had it less than 7 months \) and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2 sided tape had come off they claimed this happened due to physical damage but this occurred during normal use i was just changing modes and the lens did n't retract do n't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new even then do n't be surprised if they renege on the warranty i had another a410 that did the very same thing \( lens got jammed \) but was stolen in a break in before i sent it out for service \( so i suppose it was no loss after all \) obviously there is a design flaw that causes the lens to extend too far and come off track inside in short this camera is not suitable for frequent use in the field if you buy it and plan to use it a lot expect to be buying another camera or paying for a repair that should be covered under warranty \( which i'm not doing \) soon	23

1	i have to agree with the previous reviewer who noted the temperature discrepancy items placed closer to the firebox do get much hotter than those on the smokestack end this is probably my only complaint about this smoker this problem can be moderated somewhat you can create a makeshift baffle from aluminum flashing that will help some you can also put an aluminum drip pan full of water directly in front of the opening which will not only deflect some of the heat but introduce some humidity into the cooking section personally i just do n't fill it up with meat if you 're doing several slabs of ribs use a rib rack at the far end airflow and temperature control were problems for me at first my particular smoker works best with the air intake vent completely closed this is not an air tight smoker so it 's still drawing air through the cracks in the door by keeping the fire low and the vent closed the temperature does n't climb over 250 degrees concerning the temperature forget putting a thermometer in the space provided by brinkmann it 's too high on the lid and it will read quite a bit higher than the food at grate level heat rises you know i drilled a hole just above the handle and mounted a thermometer when i cook with the grates at the upper level this thermometer reads just about right for the level of the food when i cook on the lower level the actual temperature will be 30 50 degrees lower than what this thermometer reads it 's not totally precise but hey it 's barbeque ! ! ! i 've had this smoker for about 3 4 years i keep it under a covered area so it does n't get rained on but the humidity in my area is always high i 've had to repaint it once the firebox needs repainting now but that 's been the only maintenance i 've done to it i just clean out the ashes and the food drippings after each use and roll it under the covering until the next time before each use i line the firebox and the cooking section with heavy duty aluminum foil that makes clean up a lot easier \( what did we do before reynolds \? \) i do n't smoke a lot with the brinkmann mostly i use a weber kettle grill but every time i do a brisket or big roast or several slabs of ribs i crank this baby up and it 's never failed me yet keep the temperature low keep an eye on the fire and do n't open the cooking section very often just let nature low heat and smoke do their job	23
0	i bought this cd for one song quot walk away quot which was one of their best known songs i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems there was n't the rest of the album is like an anti climax i would suggest a greatest hits instead if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away	23
1	i have used many many products from the cheapest drugstore ones to the high end department store stuff and kinerase cream is truly one of the best for overall skin improvement i am a big fan of minimal redness and irritation and this cream delivers in spades leaves my skin beautifully soft super smooth and all without added perfume \( who 's going to smell your face \? \) and additives i have also used the lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate but i much prefer this cream which adds more moisture and does n't contain any retinoids which can cause irritation is n't that the whole premise and purpose of kinerase anyway \? great stuff	23

1	noah webster 's book is fascinating reading for today 's students and teachers alike as well as for the average citizen as there is much to learn from it while it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an official school text it certainly has a place in every school library one of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used with diacritical marks \( accents \) applied to all relevant vowels and consonants words are divided according to syllables and stress it also spells the names of letters of the alphabet something which tends to be ignored in modern teaching the terminology of traditional grammar is used and there are copious word lists with words grouped according to common factors i have no hesitation in recommending this book to all students of the english language for the above reasons and for many other interesting aspects \( now archaisms thy thou foreign words and phrases abbreviations explained punctuation etc \) this book should remain a spelling classic	23

0	a 130 minute barrage of unrelieved bathos and sentimentality this swedish import does n't so much insult your intelligence as complacently assume that you never had any in the first place would n't know what to do with it if you did have it and in general favor entertainment that bypasses the brain entirely and addresses itself directly to the tear ducts the plot is of the type commonly described in laudatory reviews as well worn which seems to be a euphemism for shop worn clich or stupefyingly unoriginal here it is \( spoilers follow \) daniel a big shot conductor in emotional difficulties and poor health returns to the quaint rural village of his childhood takes over and revives the local church choir heals himself and everyone else in sight with his life affirming yet charmingly diffident zaniness finds love finds his inner child and finally at the moment of his and his choir 's greatest triumph croaks a great director and screenwriter might have been able to conjure some life out of even this forbiddingly stale and schmaltzy program but kay pollack is n't up to it instead in a kind of perverse tour de force of misbegotten inventiveness he celebrates embraces wallows in the schmaltz throws it at you until it 's dripping off you like oobleck and somehow keeps finding more reserves of it tucked away in odd little corners of the film indeed there 's something horrifyingly impressive about the way this movie gets relentlessly stupider and more bathetic from the first frame to the last it almost bespeaks a kind of strange talent albeit of the ed wood variety and while watching it i almost suspected a cynical provocation of some kind as in the kingsley amis story about the poet who at the end of a long and successful career publishes a volume of intentional gibberish in order to expose the critical establishment as a passel of clueless poseurs \( speaking of whom as it is in heaven was nominated for best foreign film at the oscars in 2005 after being strewn with similar honors in sweden where it was reportedly seen by some two million viewers we 're used to this kind of idiocy from the academy but what 's going on in the country of strindberg and bergman \? has someone been putting something in the k ttbullar \? \) a standard feature of movies like this \( and books like this if it comes to that cf ayn rand \) is that characters are presented not as human beings but as representatives of some principle or other that the filmmaker deems important and relevant aiiih is no exception the parade of didactic marionettes includes daniel 's love interest a ditzy twenty year old blonde who represents the life force the humorless sexually repressed hypocritical preacher who represents the church which as we all know is a sinister combine bent on stamping out the sex drive and repressing all manifestations of joy and spontaneity especially in modern scandinavia the wife beater whom everybody at first inexplicably tolerates and then finally locks up and forgives who represents violence and what to do about it the retarded kid whom daniel insists on letting into the choir chiefly so that he can become the film 's symbol of the virtues of inclusiveness and the deep human wisdom of special people \( incidentally it 's about time somebody realized that sentimentalizing retarded people in movie after movie as symbols of purity goodness wisdom beyond the ken of those cursed with normal intelligence or whatever is just as disrespectful and exploitative as making cruel fun of them it just seems nicer can't we have a movie that depicts a retarded person as a human being \? the only one i can recall seeing is best boy a documentary about the life of a retarded man that came out about 25 years ago apart from that they 've been reduced to targets of witless ridicule as in there 's something about mary or turned into plaster saints as here \) so to sum up save your money and your time which would be better spent sleeping or watching reruns of the o c run do n't walk from your local art theater if this is the main attraction and do n't forget the moral of the story rather comforting to me as an expatriate american living in a europe that preens itself on its superior wisdom and sophistication vis vis the usa kitsch is global	23

0	reason once had two things going for it it articulated principled libertarianism and it was a consistently interesting magazine now its ideology is fuzzy certainly not consistently libertarian it is also dull and aimless often badly written case in point the current issue as i write includes a defense of the fda by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry the old reason would never have published such a piece nor would reason have previously published ronald bailey 's article advocating mandatory health insurance bailey also supports the iraq war and psychiatric coercion a bright spot continues to be the writing of jacob sullum	23
1	red bull used to be my favorite drink as i would not go 24 hours without drinking an entire can that era has ended simply because i was beginning to get sick of paying over 2 00 for one can i know several distributors who offer the product for 1 50 but i seldomly stock up on the stuff and end up paying the 2 00 for a can plus 8 tax which comes out to 2 15 a can which is fine with me until you realize that you are spending over 700 dollars a year at this rate it never stopped me before and i always felt that it was worth it considering the drink helps me focus in college each morning however i recently noticed that on days when i was not in school and i drank a red bull rather than being full of energy and ready to jog i would become tired i began to wonder why i would get tired after drinking a can of red bull maybe my inner body was saying stop drinking this every freaking day of your life ! whatever the case is i decided to stop buying it on a daily basis and just drink it when i have to wake up very early hopefully this can make it become effective on my body again because i think i may have overdone it considering i have probably consumed well over 1000 cans in my life i personally enjoy drinking a cold can of red bull set aside the energy factor while many people \( actually everyone i know \) says it is sick and makes them gag i kinda like that cough droppy taste that is offered in a can of red bull i find red bull to be a conversation starter for myself kinda like smoker talk i love to sip from my can of red bull and discuss the weather or some other exciting news with my peers while i have tried so many other energy drinks i can say that i do hate all of them there has never been an energy drink that i enjoyed other than red bull i guess i just like the austrian people so much \( and the fact that a can of red bull is vegan ! \) on the other hand it is full of man made chemicals that might do some weird things to me in the future only time will tell	23

1	being a wine lover i 've used all kinds of corkscrews from your basic twist model to the kind with the wings to the two pronged kind finally i received the screwpull as a gift and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end ! as others have said the screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up so there 's no actual pulling whatsoever all you do is simiply turn the easy to use lever at the top of the device in almost 10 years of usage the screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try \( probably because i started too close to the edge \) simply starting over solved the problem spend a little more money to buy the screwpull and you 'll never need to buy another corkscrew again highly recommended	23
1	we have owned other hoover steam cleaners they did a terrific job but all ended up leaking we purchased a bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet we bought the hoover f5914 900 based on the reviews i was confident that it would n't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in america i was confident it would be a better product and hoover had gotten their act together we have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack i could n't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when i knew hoover could do just as good a job ok our hoover came my husband put it together and it leaked all over i then re read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them by then we had already taken it to the repair center after a week they had not touched it my husband picked the machine up and brought it home we decided to start from square one and put it together again he did following the directions to the letter lo and behold no leaks ! ! ! ! ! yeah ! my carpets are beautifully clean and i am a very happy woman so the moral to this story is always read the directions first	23

0	the minor problem is that the user manual claims the user id is admin well it is not frustration and wasted time will occur until you somehow find out that the user id should be left blank to log in the major problem is that the unit only works for twelve to 36 hours before it has be rebooted after twelve to 36 hours it looses the connection to the wireless network once you unplug and plug back the power cord it will work fine for another twelve to 36 hours i am used to rebooting windows every time it hangs but i do n't accept having a wireless access point that hangs \( i am not sure how microsoft was able to convince me it is ok for an os to hang \) this box is going back i already bought a buffalo that works fine	23

1	i'm an afl fan and have been for a while so i got this game since it sounded interesting it 's not the truest sim out there it 's more like nfl blitz but indoors still it 's a very fun game if you remember the 2000 afl season i would have liked to seen more of these games for each season at least this game will satisfy my appetite for afl football i would suggest all afl fans to get this game simply for the joy it will bring to you and the fact that this is the only repesentation of the best brand of football out there i just wish other smaller leagues \( like the wnba \) would get a contract for games since there are many fans of these lesser known sports that would love to have sim games go rattlers go pred	23
0	this item is not nine inches wide it is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan but costs ten dollars more so you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size hopefully the item description will be changed soon now i have to pack up and ship back several of these but at least amazon is paying the freight lodge logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though i think this is just a random error just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7 99 the cornsticks will be the same size	23

0	this was nothing but a cheap piece of masonite board that you can have cut for about 5 00 at any hardware store it cost me a total of 23 00 after shipping for this product it does n't even look like the picture it is n't black with angelcare written on it it is literally a normal brown piece of board it 's blatant false advertizing i feel sick not to mention a total idiot for thinking i would actually need this particular board to go with my monitor if you have the angelcare movement sensor monitor and do n't have a flat bottomed crib then all you need is any old piece of wood or thick cardboard do not buy this it is a disgrace	23

0	have you played any of the games in the doom series \? how about metroid prime \? medal of honor \? golden eye \? well then you 've played halo 2 also because all first person shooter games are exactly the same i do n't care how many times x box magazine \( odd how the magazine that drools the most over an x box game is the system 's magazine \) calls it the greatest game of all time i 'd rather play mario power tennis which was atrocious the story is absolutely appauling in terms of a science fiction orientated theme utterly mundane unoriginal boring and just all around unentertaining the gameplay is so generic that it 's as if this was the first creation of some fresh out of college video game designer the music is cliche the voice acting is flat and master chief is just an all around retard the weapons oh boy the weapons again another lame aspect of the game the alien 's weapons are like something in the kid 's toy gun section from toys r us and the human guns are nothing that i have n't used in a resident evil game when the first halo came out i did n't get the big deal i did n't even play it then eventually i got myself an x box and decided to give this installment a shot huge mistake come to think of it none of the games of x box are even worth owning a system for fable was decent but got old after beating it a few times the knights of the old republic series was boring and everything else on x box i could play on ps2 or gamecube	23

0	i cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub par testament release testament must have taken hints from metallica and tried to attract a different audience this is not a horrible album but compared to any other testament album it is easily their worst only the die hard testament fan or those into commercial metal should pick this up	23

1	if you are searching for adirondack chairs like i did a few weeks ago you will find a wide array of prices too ridiculous to mention this strathwood for 79 99 and 10 for shipping is a steal ! i have not been able to find them cheaper anywhere ! you get the chair and the foot stool which is why i rated it 4 stars the quality is decent i think for the price you get what you pay for and a bit more the kit comes almost constructed you have do the final screws the chair comes pre oiled however i highly recommend oiling it again if you want the color to last i also recommend teaqua do not use conventional teak oil i do agree with the previous reviewer that if you sit in the chair for an hour it can get uncomfortable however i purchased cushions for it and sitting for an hour has not been a problem the construciton is sturdy they have been sitting on my deck for about a month now and all is well mahalo	23

0	this is a cute idea and a cute design but ! it is not realistic ! when you put your babydoll inside it takes a bit esp for a child to get the sling hanging around neck correctly and turned right then the poor baby doll falls directly out of it no back support on it the only way she stays in is if your hands never leave her ! so if the price which is on sale right now lures you i would suggest an older child rather than say 3 or so my 3 year old doesnt like it and for her abilities i dont like it either but now my 6 year old she can do it when she is being patient enough ! only 2 stars given for its cuteness and price at the moment otherwise too difficult and unsupportive to suit my girls \)	23

1	quality of this product was excellent i have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover would recomment this to anyone i have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it only one complaint the clip is not tight enough on my belt would recommend a little tighter overall the best i have ever seen the stitches are even and tight good quality	23

0	i gave this to my fiance for christmas who loves sudoku and video games so i thought it would be a brilliant combination he was excited but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play he ca n't always tell where the cursor is on the board so if he sets it down for a minute he ca n't see where 's he 's left off then when he was playing in the semi dark while we were on a train he could n't see anything either \( backlight would be a nice feature \) it just seems this model is not designed very intuitively he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number but it clears the game all that to say 2 million puzzles sounds great unless it 's too frustrating to play	23
1	being a fan of the better cg and graphics of sci fi such as star trek \( the newer ones \) i was greatly surpised at how good the v series was v the final battle is the second installment of the saga so make sure to buy v the miniseries first the storyline is good and characters are likeable and three dimensional i highly recommend it for any sci fi fan for old hands it is a fun movie and for newcomers to both the series and the genre it is a good introduction	23
1	i really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good the only thing i don acute t like is the way the strings work there are not enough and also they rip off easily not stitched well for the price generally bumper pads are not recommended for babies before age 12 months since the air gets blocked away from the bed also suffication could be a problem we have bought a convertable crib \( common in europe \) which can be used till approx age 5 and so we will attach the bumper to the bed later anyhow we still love it it looks and matches perfectly to the rest of safari	23
1	originally looked to buy the wasa light rye but it was out of stock so bought the sourdough rye and multi grain instead and glad i did because they have broadened my selection of favorite wasa brand crispbreads and while i normally avoid products with yeast i feel that the toasty crispness of the multi grain has neutralized any negative aspects \( that yeast is a negative is my story and i'm stickin' to it ! \) that may be derived from containing yeast as for varied uses it 's equally great for strengthening the teeth \( and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten \) when eaten as a cracker or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes oh some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads which means what 's inside is edible for humans too i keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well still my preference among all the wasa crispbreads is the light rye only 2 ingredients rye flour and sea salt just give me the simple life without the two accompanying airheads that is	23
0	the first one of these i had came apart at every seam the first time i washed it i returned it and got another i was pleased with until about the 6th washing and now it is starting to fall apart they just do n't seem to be well made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure	23
1	i thought this product was very unique it 's not as advanced as ipods which is great for younger kids although the only thing i did n't like was that it was a bit too small	23
0	it was larger than i expected from the images thicker too in my opinion it did n't look as classy as the picture made me believe i was very disappointed that the regular second hand was not in fact the large sweeping thin hand that 's actually only for the stop watch the regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle really with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which and the cheaper look of the watch in person i never actually put it on before sending it back	23
0	the description doesnt mention it but the weights are sand filled bags when using all 5 of them at the same time the weight is very bulky and uncomfortable	23
1	it 's difficult to identify the exact pinnacle of alfred hitchcock 's masterworks especially as he had a most fruitful period during the 1950 's until the 1960 classic psycho but 1946 's notorious is arguably his most perfectly crafted and cast film first there is a sharp intensely plotted script by the estimable ben hecht that focuses on alicia huberman the daughter of a convicted nazi spy and t r devlin an american agent hired to convince alicia to spy on a clandestine group of neo nazis based in rio de janeiro this means she would have to seduce and eventually marry alex sebastian a key group member who has never gotten over alicia in his heart this triangle is embodied by three stars at the height of their powers a primarily poker faced cary grant portrays devlin close to the vest and charismatically hides his emotions under a veil of cold arrogance in a series of scenes that pierce with a subverted eroticism devlin falls in love with alicia but cannot find the courage to admit that to himself or to her claude rains on the other hand imbues sebastian with such an open romanticism and sad streaks of jealousy that we can actually sympathize with a nazi war criminal a year after wwii ended quite a daring feat within the film 's historical context at the vortex though is ingrid bergman who probably gives her most accomplished performance as alicia at the time she was deified as the chaste mother superior in leo mccarey 's harmless the bells of st mary 's with bing crosby bergman turned a smart corner here as a loose woman in love with the bottle until she is transformed by her love for devlin at which point she becomes a stylish decoy to draw the na ve sebastian to her alluring charms ethereally beautiful and constantly pained she conveys much of her character 's feelings through her eyes and subtle facial expressions because she and grant portray two people who ca n't admit they desperately want to be together even if her life depends on it their failure to communicate leads to alicia sinking deeper into the morass of some nasty espionage business that ultimately puts her life in jeopardy the chemistry between the two legends is palpable especially in the then controversial three minute kissing sequence that put censors into a tizzy however above all this is a hitchcock film the film is filled with his genius for ingenious subjective camerawork and suspenseful set pieces the latter perfectly illustrated by the party sequence at sebastian 's mansion starting with an unbelievable dolly shot right into alicia 's hand clasping the cellar key which she passes to devlin to find what is being hidden in the wine bottles there are intriguing performances on the sidelines with louis calhern as the head of the american agency in rio and the intimidating madame konstantin as alex 's ice cold mother both displaying a machiavellian spirit to get what they want the criterion collection has done another masterful job with their dvd package including an alternative audio commentary track featuring renowned hitchcock scholar marian keane providing insightful scene specific analysis and film historian rudy behlmer as was common with movie hits of the day the movie was recreated in condensed form for radio and the 1948 lux radio theater adaptation starring the voices of ingrid bergman and joseph cotten is included as well there are also lots of still photos a collection of trailers and teasers and even production correspondence and script excerpts of deleted scenes and alternate endings for the more anal retentive among us this is a true classic and required viewing for any fan of hitchcock bergman grant or rains	23

0	i think in retrospect i wasted my time on this one it had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me as i read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery i kept on hoping that there would be something more to it something more enigmatic a brilliant twist but i was left with despair my major problem with this novel was there were not enough in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer and bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities i will never touch this author 's book again ! a mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best dan brown	23

1	i purchased this gps back in april of 2006 and have been very happy with it since it is not perfect but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker gps it 's a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises in the car it is accurate and maps routes quickly 90 of the time the other 10 of the time it either looses signal has outdated maps \( my update is ordered and on it 's way as i type \) or just slow processing for some reason of this 10 of the time i 'd say only 2 of the time has this been an actual problem for me the rest of the time i was able to simply guess what i needed to do next or it did n't matter at all i have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations but the vast majority of the time this has n't been an issue on foot one of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof both qualities needed to be used for hiking the only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads otherwise you will get some really confusing directions ! also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses but it can be done \( put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route ! \) on boat have n't tested this as i do n't have a boat and have n't purchased the water based maps overall i'm very happy with this and looking forward to the map update i wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points it 's still better than buying lugging around 2 seperate gps systems to me	23
0	this is very bad doesnot work and really interfers with other programs almost impossible to remove it	23

1	i bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and i 'd have to say the reviews i read about on the titan were dead on my 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using i also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward i can still use this seat i wish i had bought this seat from the get go	23
1	if you do n't need outlook but do need powerpoint this is a great value before you had to be a student or teacher to get a good price \( full retail 150 now \) office 2003 standard even on ebay is still going for 175 plus this does not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but the new ribbon format is not difficult to learn also do n't worry about file formats you can re set the default format to prior formats so that anything you send out can be read by earlier versions of microsoft office	23

0	i used to like rob zombie up until hellbilly delux everything after that is garbage this album is no exception every song sounds the same and is very predictable the lyrics are nonsensical educated horses \? he says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this cd i think he is running out of material and throwing crappy cd 's together to scrap in some extra money he needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented i do n't recommend this cd to anyone except the die hard stalker type fans that will buy all of his cd 's merchandise regardless 1 star i went through this cd in less than 10 minutes very disappointed and will never put it back into a cd player again	23
1	i used the compressor to add air to 4 tires approx 5 7 psi per tire and it worked fine did n't take too long however there are 2 problems with the device 1 after adding air to 2 tires the rubber inside the nozzle was already ripping and becoming unattached so that it would get in the way when trying to connect it to the valve stem after 4 tires it was very ripped up 2 the compressor vibrates so much that you ca n't put it onthe ground while running or it falls over i guess that 's the price you pay for the light weight of the compressor while the rubber seal is a concern it 's not enough for me to return the compressor because it did work i only hope the seal does n't get so bad that the nozzle wo n't keep a good connection with the valve stem	23
1	ok so there are n't as many ads \( which incidentally helps its portability \) but i 've been reading computer shopper for 6 years now and i still find it a great read and a very valuable resource i read every issue not only for its usefulness but also for entertainment value i guess you can call me a tech geek ! it 's a great tool for keeping up to date with the latest high tech gear i particularly like the alfred poor 's computer cures articles and how to guides for us do it yourselfers its features and buying guides are relevant and very informative over the past few years i have bought several computer systems for myself and family members thanks to advice from the experts at computer shopper and their recommendations on where to buy so even though i do miss the tech mall feel of the old magazine i'm still a fan and would recommend it to anyone interested in buying technology	23

0	i always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous now i 've seen the opposite taxcut online seems totally not thorough such as just asking for total of certain things and not asking if special circumstances apply which you do n't miss at all until you have one of them i had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home i moved half way through the year i could n't find where to add an additional home office listing nope ca n't do it said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting you 'll have to use another product so today i start from scratch and pay the 99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners i encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year s	23

0	i am a parent of a 9 year old daughter who loves dolls she was given the love me chou chou doll for christmas \( 12 25 05 \) on christmas day we were unable to get the doll to fall asleep so on 12 26 05 i went back to the store to exchange the doll with no luck i found that the second doll would not fall asleep either i looked on the zapf creation web site under most frequently asked questions and received more instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the doll will not fall asleep apparently this is a problem not only with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well if the company knows that this is one of the most frequently asked questions why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep like the instructions say \? it is very discouraging for a 9 year old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being advertised and it does not do that it is also very upsetting to a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and hopes of looking for a working doll these dolls are very expensive and should work like the instructions say they should we have tried everything we can to get the love me chou chou doll to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen i have even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep she then explained she had her mother a grandmother to rock the doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind this was not rock a bye chou chou we have even tried to rock this doll with no luck of getting the doll to fall asleep i have even taken the doll back to the store for an exchange but was advised the doll is no longer being sold at the store where i purchased it	23
1	my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid there 's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar i really like that it 's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar it 's great for those who do n't want a flowery bath but who ca n't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar i wish i 'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies plus this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb really probably any bomb would do good stuff	23
1	with all the reviews about how easy the nano scratches i left the protective film on until i found the right case the next day at cc \( they had just received them that day \) sorry amazon but the nano did come from you anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the nano itself it comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself i have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible it works great it fits snugly in this case yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update the case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls i have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all the belt clip is sturdy and secure the magnetic snap for closing it works great the case can be closed with headphones attached but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access this case is as cool as the nano itself and i would very highly recommend it i hope belkin makes the same case for the new ipod	23

1	we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1 and 2 year old children it 's intended for children a little older and i can see why as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps however my 2 year old can use it by herself and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys i had to hold it in place for my 1 year old but when doing so it also allowed him to color i would recommend it especially for children 3 and up	23

0	this movie is typical hollywood anti war anti military anti american trash the show biz liberals aided and abetted by their ideological cousins the left wing tv news moguls have always sought to portray american soldiers in viet nam as baby killing drug crazed monsters this movie is typical of that ilk if you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war buy the dvd of we were soldiers a much better and far more honest film	23

1	i 've been using this for the last 3 months and i'm a very satisfied customer i get a very close shave and no razor bumpors i'm afircan american and my beard is coarse and curly sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown hair problems i highly recommend this because it 's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as braun and norelic it 's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil i cam across these because the only time i would get a great shave was at the barber when he used clippers on me i 've never had any problems with ingrown hair therefore i decided to own my own pair of clippers i'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming	23
1	this is a very high quality snack which combines a hearty solid granola with irresistable double chocolate i really love this product a chocolate lover 's dream yet it 's surprisingly healthy and not too sweet the fat sugar content is comparable to most other granolas i 've tried numerous granola 's over the years and this one is special probably not the most nutritious granola overall but it 's definitely a treat for the tastebuds and a welcome relief from ordinary granolas i would not have this as my exclusive source of granola but i will buy this many more times in the future to satisfy my chocoholic cravings in fact i will probably always keep this product handy because it 's highly satisfying great for a breakfast snack or dessert yummy	23

0	this keyboard folds out well and i liked the feel of the keys however the ir connector needs to be in direct connection with the ir port in the pda for the ipaq this port is at the bottom of the handheld the 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area in order to have the proper connectivity you have to turn the handheld on its side this then requires another software program download \( not freeware that i can find \) to rotate your screen to the landscape view unless you can read sideways without getting a headache before buying this product check your handheld to see if your ir port is between 4 8 o'clock if so this may be a difficult keyboard to use	23
0	this roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever first it does n't work second i cannot obtain any support from roxio to find out why they wo n't give support until you register the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software and it takes you to a website that either does n't exist or is always down thus it turns out to be a complete waste of money not to mention several hours of time run do n't walk away from this software and this company	23

0	got the archos to be able to take it with me when i travel for work and have movies on my flights the recording with the dvr station is great but in order to hear what i recorded in a quiet room i had to have the volume turned up to 99 hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible i contacted amazon and got a replacement that part was great but the new one i have to have the volume up to 80 to hear anything in a quiet room i also found the that for the jack out to tv you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc needless to say i will be returning the ones i have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch	23

1	this book is among seminal works on system safety and safety engineering and should be read by anyone who is entering the field one may not necessarily agree with prof leveson 's views \( e g her often unfair and unjustified dismissal of european approaches to safety engineering \) but her views in the field are simply too important and influential to be ignored ! the book is a good bed time reading that gives an overview of the field major problems and introduction to some major approaches it is however not a handbook per se you will not understand any particular method sufficiently to apply it overall very good introductory text with a good coverage and a very easy and clear language	23

0	i enjoy this genre of film but found this one dull it carries a rough smattering of supposedly sentimental and inspiring elements that are intended to create cohesion and a willing suspension of disbelief but fall short of both aims i actually groaned in response to the predictability and shuttered at the stereotypes which were mentioned in another review at best stereotypes of ignorant aggressively dangerous and perpetually struggling african and hispanic american students who are lost in the world and can only be saved by a lovable blue eyed blonde haired european american belle with superior life experience and intelligence are offensive at worst these stereotypes are haled as informative and inspiring this movie has hit the worst in perpetuating stereotypes as both further it fails to inspire thought or commentary on real racial societal and economic issues which is what this genre of film is usually esteemed for	23
1	brian regan is simply a comedic genius this cd is especially funny after having seen him live you can just picture his hilarious gestures and facial expressions ! he has managed to create a hysterical routine based on the silly stuff we 've all said done thought while i too enjoy comedians who are more cutting edge i do n't think a routine has to be peppered with profanity to be funny this cd is well worth any price check out his dvd and his live show too	23

1	i am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit i bought the canon because it has facilities for an external mike i am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another first on the matter of tape drive noise yes i can hear it if i put the unit up to my ear but no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer second they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer what they do n't tell you is that you need a firewire card and cable \( about 70 00 total at best buy \) you cannot simply hook up through the available computer usb port fortunately microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the xp os and minimal capture software called moviemaker i am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit i think it is a bargain finally i have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out your thumb easily controls on off and tape transport functions it is really easy to use at least for right handed users all considered i am satisfied with the product of course if it dies next week i will have a different opinion	23
1	when the armchair detective stopped being published i was without a good mystery magazine i received a complimentary copy of mystery scene and i subscribed to it the magazine is published 5 times per year and features great interviews and good book reviews i especially enjoy their reviewing lesser known authors and books by independent publishers my favorite part is the where are they now which features authors who seem to have stopped writing a particular series many of whom i have read in the past an excellent publication	23
0	i received this seat as a gift for my baby shower i thought it was going to be a great seat graco has been on the market for several years and it 's built up a reputation but was i wrong ! everytime that i would go out with my newborn and i would make a turn the seat would flip over to the side it did not matter how slow i made the turn it would always do the same thing i'm a very carefull driver specially after i gave birth to my son you ca n't imagine how horrible it is to look throuhg the rearview mirror and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy has flipped over and his head is hanging i would have to look for a place to park and have to fix him and the seat i had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest just so that it would n't tip over and it made it a little difficult to drive you might say she probably did n't install it well but you would be wrong it was perfectly installed i had someone check the installation in my city and everything was fine the base of the seat is not completely flat making it difficult for the seat to stay in place this did not just happen to me it also happened to my sister with her baby 's seat we had our children with a few weeks difference i had to get a different seat i purchased one with a flatter base and that one worked perfectly i will never buy another graco seat again i believe it 's worth spending more money on a better seat i believe ones children are priceless and investing money in their safety	23
1	am very pleased with my purchase speedy shipping will use agai	23
0	this item sounded great in the ad but the only thing right in the ad is that it 's pocket sized no one can understand what i say through it when the volume is turned up the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent i thought this would be a great device but no one can understand me 10 feet away much less 200 if you order this device save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund warning the shipping is non refundable	23
1	i'm new to the digital slr world i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt the built in flash had done alright but was nothing to write home about since i had spent most of my money on the camera i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done this flash met both requirements if you are an advance user you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features yet if you a newbie like me this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly	23

1	i bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and i love it he 's 5 months old now and i have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems i have to pump in the ladies room where i work but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what i'm doing i work 10 hour shifts so i pump quite a bit but this pump is so easy to use that i do n't have the hand wrist pain that i 've had with other manual pumps overall the bag is stylish and discreet the bottles are fabulous \( no nipple confusion problems \) and i have not had any problems with any part of it the only thing i would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you ca n't keep your milk in the fridge i had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day otherwise i have no complaints excellent product and service	23
1	waterproof cases are so expensive ! \( and heavy \) we are n't divers but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics skiing hiking fishing at the beach etc in addition to water dirty hands sand and dust are hazards this aquapac performs as described kept the camera \( canon a95 \) safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc the picture quality was unaffected but flash does n't work well due to internal reflections well worth the price	23

0	i got this phone basically for free but even taking that into account i'm pretty disappointed with the phone this is my first samsung and i'm pretty sure my last one ! i owned a nokia before and i regret that i betrayed it from now i would n't get anything besides nokia and in the worst case maybe sony ericsson so here is a short list of those little things that make your life with this phone \( and it 's combination with t mobile \) annoying the keys are not comfortable to use it 's not really comfortable to open close the slider and to make it easier you have to put your thumb on the screen which leaves is greasy all the time putting a comma while writing a text message capitalizes the next word what is the logic in that \? ! \( it annoys me because i do use text messages a lot \) you ca n't set the camera shutter to be silent you can only save 1 phone type for each category what if the person has 2 business phones you cannot choose the e mail address of a person from the contact list when you want to send a picture message to an e mail address and there is a lot more of those little illogical things that were just not thought through like it would 've been in a nokia \( even in a model 5 years old ! \) oh yeah and t mobile really contributed to the greatness of this phone removing some of the features and limiting others like setting your mp3 as a ringtone \( although there is an easy hack around it just change the extension from mp3 to 3gp	23

1	this game while simple in it 's storyline shows us the depth and power of disney matched with square enix first square and enix merge effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest rpg 's of all time \( dragon quest and final fantasy \) now we have the perfect pairing of wit humor heart and pure square story based in many of the worlds from disney legends your character sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing the chains you can get going in sora 's attacks are amazing the extra battles in the sky over london and in the hercules arena are outstanding to learn this battle style you must have wits of steel and thumbs of orchaleum the battle against sephiroth one of the best known villians from the final fantasy series is awesome i never did beat sephiroth but the battle was intense and i had him beaten to his knees several times the bottom line is the sequel will be amazing as it revisits many of the same worlds and reinvents itself this game essentially creates a new genre blending a soulful cast with characters from disney lore the underpinning story is not to be missed be sure you get the extended ending by following the brady games guide the summons are a bit hard to leverage but tinker bell comes in handy in some of the tougher battles 360 degree rotating battles with the shadow king in the sky above london and the final villian will thrill and captivate audiences of all ages the secrets hidden in the game are rightly difficult to find and awe inspiring in their execution	23
0	well after reading the reviews of this vacuum i decided to give it a try i have had it a month now and i have to say that i am sorry i bought this behemoth right out of the box and trying it for the first time i noticed things that i did n't like i thought i 'd give it some time though and hoped i could adjust here is what i found 1 the vacuum is very heavy as other reviewers have stated 2 worse than the vacuum being heavy the darn thing is really hard to push even on hard smooth surfaces it 's hard to push i have not figured out yet what the heck would cause it to have so much drag for it to drag on hard surfaces it must be a design flaw 3 the on off power switch is foot operated not a terrible thing but dirt devil decided to put the darn thing out of view and hidden by the accessory carriage on my first time of vacuuming i accidentally ran over a sock and it got caught in the floor brush while the brush belt was smoking i fumbled around for the damn power switch i finally had to reach down and press the switch by hand because i could n't find it by looking down it must have taking me eight to ten seconds to finally turn the thing off unfortunately the damage was done the belt snapped how nice i really liked that first time out and the belt snapped another note about the switch there have been times i have had to repeatedly press the switch because it would not lock off it takes a firm steady pressure to turn it off the fun part of this annoyance is that you think you have it turned off because the motor starts winding down and as soon as you let up on it the motor powers up couple that with not being able to really see the darn thing it 's a real challenge maybe dirt devil thinks we have eyes on our toes hey dirt devil here is an idea how about putting the on off switch on the push handle what a novel idea doh ! 4 the vacuum hose that detaches is really unwieldy it has a long plastic handle that you hold onto and that makes it really difficult to manipulate the hose the main reason being is that the hose it too short it 's like you are fighting the hose all the time it gets tiring 5 the detachable hose is really hard to re install in it 's port you have to wedge it in there really hard to get the thing to seat 6 the vacuum is terrible on rugs on any of the floor height settings it bunches up the rugs and starts smoking baby my old vac was not much better but at least with the old one i could lift the vac and kind of drag it over the rug and it would n't get all caught up i tried the same thing with the dirt devil and forget about it it jammed up every time 7 the vacuum is poor at getting dirt off of hard surface floors it just moves the dirt around or spits it out the back i have to use the hose attachment 8 the vacuum is horrible on steps with my old vac i could drag the vac across each step whilst the vacuum is locked in the upright position easy deal the dirt devil does not work that way when the vacuum is in the upright position the brush is too high off the carpet to do any good the only option is to disengage the lock and vacuum with the back slanted one little problem with that the weight of the vac cause the seal at the base of the dirt canister to open and air begins leaking you do n't get a good positive suction so you have to play with the position of the tilt to get the proper seal the problem is that the proper position you need is so close to where the vacuum locks into the upright position it often locks and so then you have to try and un lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth it 's a joke the only half easy way to do steps is if use the detachable hose and attach the power brush the only problem with that is you are fighting the ill designed hose and heavy vacuum and not to mention that the brush attachment will only really get surface dirt if you try putting pressure for some deep cleaning the brush stops now for pros 1 the vacuum does seem to get the carpets pretty clean it has good suction and it raises the carpet fibers right up it almost makes my carpet look like new and i do not see an excessive amount of carpet fibers in the dirt canister some vacuums like to just tear up carpets 2 the rotating brush attachment works pretty good for removing cat hair off of couches and bedding all in all this vacuum was very very poorly designed i may just have to donate this thing and buy something else i ca n't imagine fighting this thing every week for years to come or until the motor dies maybe i 'll be lucky and the motor will die soon then i 'll just throw the darn thing out and buy something other than dirt devil steve	23

0	the only reason i'm reviewing this movie now is because i just watched it on tv today and the only reason i watched it was because nothing else was on so no let 's be fair i did enjoy analyze this i really did though it was n't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life or even for the rest of the day and i do love both billy crystal and robert de niro they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie i did n't have very high expectations though because i rarely expect too much of sequels once again i was proven right analyze that illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word the original film had a spark of originality the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again but of course that could never work it 's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel those who have n't seen the original would n't understand the jokes and those who have already heard them before and that is why they fail time after time so what does this movie have \? a great comedic duo a couple of really funny guys yeah and \? fathers' day had an even better pair look what happened to that a couple of good mafia jokes \? sure sure i even cracked a smile on several occasions but that is n't enough there are thousands of comedy films out there not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable and producers think they 'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas newsflash think again nobody watches these movies there 's no reason to when you can just watch the original again	23

1	with the ps2 's life cycle coming to an end there are hardly any new games that are anything remotely spectacular capcom 's okami however is just that and it 's not just one of the best games to ever grace the ps2 it 's one of the most original games you 'll ever play the first thing you 'll notice about okami is the game 's incredibly unique art style and graphics which are some of the best to ever grace the ps2 seriously this game looks incredible you wo n't believe your eyes okami 's storyline is based on japanese legend dealing with the sun god amaterasu who you play as in the form of a white wolf and the epic quest that awaits him now what truly sets okami apart from the rest of the pack is the caligraphy esque celestial brush that you must use to advance throughout the game need a bridge \? draw it need to dispatch a pesky enemy \? draw him in half this brush adds a new dynamic to the gameplay which is fresh and unique and makes you wonder why no one has ever tried anything like it before in a game of this type there 's loads of side quests and mini games as well adding to the length of okami which truly make it an epic game and all of which help make this one of the best games ever on the ps2 if there 's anything bad to say about okami it 's that the combat can get too easy at spots but that is only an extremely minor gripe all in all okami is just the thing that ps2 owners have been waiting and yearning for an original epic adventure that does n't get stale and provides some of the most unique and mouth watering graphics you 'll ever see if you own a ps2 okami is an absolute must own and it 's one of the best games you 'll ever play	23

1	i think if charles bukowski dylan thomas and fellini collaborated on a piece of writing it 's possible they would have come up with this screenplay this movie is exciting because it 's soooo different from anything i 've ever seen deliciously non linear the substance abuse aspect is a little overdone but that 's the destiny of quot artist movies quot i loved hearing the dialog and kristofferson 's acting is the best i 've ever seen by him anything so daring and so unconventional will naturally upset some people \( like other reviewers here \) but if you ask me that only validates the work if ever i go to new york city the hotel chelsea will be at the top of my list of places to visit my favorite lines were by the crazy guy in the elevator who after claiming to have had a conversation with dylan thomas said that ghosts naturally reside in places like the chelsea because people will listen to them there the dvd extras contain a couple of quirky interviews one with director ethan hawke and the other with robert sean leonard who plays a deeply troubled folksinger in the film	23

1	my local sam 's club discontinued the nature 's path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales i was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed quaker instants ick ! not to mention i'm tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays then i remembered amazon selling a lot of easily shippable bulk foods including organics ! \) the nature 's path oatmeal absorbs water much better and the texture is heartier than other leading brands it is also very flavorful the variety pack is nice since i used to tire of the sam 's club selection of maple and brown sugar only my kids love steel cut oats with a little pure maple syrup but it 's not the most convenient breakfast food the nature 's path instant oatmeal is quick and easy during the busy weekday mornings and best of all i can understand the ingredients label without having to take a chemistry refresher class i'm very satisfied with my first organic purchase from amazon we now peruse the selection of organic foods on amazon before making local purchases	23

1	we waited until our daughter was to get her this and it 's fantastic ! she 's now and it 's in storage but she was using it until she was about i like that the height is adjustable the springs are covered and the seat comes out easily to wash it \( it was a poop eroo for us too \) a few things that i learned using this though is the blue spinning toy does n't come out and yucky stuff can collect underneath it it is incredibly hard to clean the one that i got was a pain in the tush to get the batteries in so once the batteries died we set the kangaroo part aside my daughter 's feet got rubbed raw when we first got this because she loved jumping in it i recommend using a pair of robeez or at very least a pair of socks to protect their feet	23
1	this gate has some good points and just one negative pros good price easy to operate mine are very easy on the batteries i replace them about every 2 months they are located on the kid 's bedroom doorways about 8' apart from each other we use them as a double safety for the top of the stairs and to keep the roaming 22 month old out of his sister 's room when she wants some quiet time for those of you who have multiple gates and complain about 1 control unlocking both gates you should know that if you replace the batteries at the same time and arm the first gate it sends out the signal to both gates and programs it to unlock both so simply set up one gate while the batteries are out of the other then set up the second gate seperately i have never had them malfunction following these steps cons i also have had my toddler wedge a knee in the door i found that this was due to the gate not being tight enough it was very frustrating and a little scary but we were always able to help him out of the gate by sitting him down and pulling him straight back we nearly got rid of this gate because of a few times dealing with this but since we tightened up the pressure on the gate we have had no problems it has also stripped some of the paint from my doorway where the tension feet are right down to bare wood i will have to repaint and patch when these gates come down the also should be a little taller imo and if the gate is not tight enough it can become dislodged and open always check the gate when you close it to make sure it is closed a few rare occasions i have found it not completely closed this usually happens when you manually open the gate then try to use the remote button to open it overall 4 stars would be 5 stars if the gate was taller and the bars a little closer to prevent pinching good price though and it is put together well	23

1	i love love loooooove this system ! i have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago before this i was pumping and storing in medela bottles then transferring to playtex liners before feeding then i had to wash all the medela bottles plus playtex rings etc with this system i just pump right into the liners they are so easy to just grab out of the fridge and go i can warm a bottle with the car warmer using the self contained liners instead of having to bring a medela bottle to warm plus a playtex system overall this has saved me several steps and less things to wash for the dad who said it threw off the ounce markers that is true however the liners themselves have ounce markings on them just unscrew the top ring slightly so that the liner sinks back down and then read the ounce marker on the liner easy ! i would not buy this system to use for storing frozen milk \( if you store a lot of it \) it would get too expensive for my tastes i have two sets and that is perfect for refrigerator storage make sure you get two because each box only comes with one pump adapter highly recommended by one happy mamma	23
1	i ordered these earrings thinking they 'd be as round as the picture seems to imply they 're really nice but honestly they 're not as round as they look in the image which i found a tad disappointing at first they 're not totally flat or anything like that but the drops look a bit flatter in person than they do in the picture i'm not blaming amazon or silver insanity for it since they 've done nothing wrong products can look different in pictures than in person due to things like light and camera angles i just want to give notice to people who buy these earrings and yes they are a substantial piece of jewelry as the previous reviews imply but not so big that they 're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy they 're very nice	23

1	this book is a very good study into what happen to the lost ten tribes of israel mr capt did a great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the assyrians which is called the house of omri this book is very in depth and very informative i also noticed a person left one star because mr capt did say anything about the jews of course the jew 's would n't be metioned they were n't taken into exile until 586 bce and that was by babylonia and not assyria when reading about the ten tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not jews over all i give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid bible reader intrested in research	23

0	i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti i found the subject interesting and the professor gave wonderful lectures i had good expectations about this book going in but those quickly soured as i read it it seems correct at least about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock not that such is a particularly daunting feet however it is rife with laughable fallacies for instance it calls david bowie amongst other glam rock bands of the era metal it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all such as the carpenters i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs for instance it claims 'thunder rolls' by garth brooks is about domestic violence its about infedility not focusing on violence at all but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on the writing is also rather dry many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band 's successes or failures after reading the book in completetion i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues \( 50s to 60s \) that i had thought were true in the end i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything	23

1	derek jarman 's 'sebastiane' is a momentous painting which is simply brushed on film rather than canvas this is a master work and should be in any serious film buff 's cabinet \( i should very much like to see it running continuously upon a smooth stone wall of a monumental pillared vestibule perhaps like the four seasons in new york it 's visual beauty should be constantly on view not one element could be added or deleted if i may continue the painting analogy each stroke whether finished or raw melds this work into a composition which i think is flawless the men are beautiful but in a tangible human manner the settings whether diocletian 's startling lurid palace or the rough bare terrain of sardinia evoke both pagan and christian motifs flawlessly good and evil \( and all shades between \) found in both places the irony of the world as it is and has always been the homoerotic nature of the film is vicseral candid rather than overtly condescending it might well be set in modrn iraq with 21st century troops i felt each character 's longings whether for the god of carnal flesh or that of human love and companionship or a spiritual and other worldly deity the recognituion that each of these forms of eros may entertwine and meld is genious it is everyman it is a scrupulus portrait of the easily duplicit qualities of beauty deceipt brutality and even truth powerful stuff	23

1	'fais moi des vacances' \( we need a vacation \) is a finely wrought little film that studies the disparities between the classes in france while introducing us to a warmly tender and humorous friendship between two young lads directed and written by didier bivel \( with writing assistance from djamila djabri \) it offers a slice of life we rarely see that underbelly of france 's projects where mixed races strive to exist without the amenities of those with means who surround their neighborhoods lucien \( aymen sa di \) lives with his father \( bernard blancan \) mother \( hiam abbass \) young sister pamela \( laura mas navarro \) and his tough streetwise older brother jos \( nabil el bouhairi \) in a small flat close by is his african friend adama \( ibrahim koma \) and his equally poor family of father \( makan fofana \) mother \( marie philom ne nga \) and sister fanta \( hawa yakar sissoko \) as school ends the kids whose families have money take them on a vacation a state neither lucien nor adama can afford despite their obsession with that luxury the two boys manipulate funds and ideas and ultimately come up with the idea of secretly jumping aboard a ruv of a family headed for the beach but despite the success of their plan and the encouragement of the daughter of the van 's owners the boys end up not at the beach but at a nudist camp a fact that makes them flee ! upon returning home both boys' families punish their activities and when lucien seeks comfort from his older brother jos beats him and tells him to grow up in the end the boys finagle their way to the beach but of course by this time vacation time is over and they are on an empty beach re evaluating their lives the cast is uniformly strong the writing is excellent and the camera work not only captures the claustrophobia of the projects but also opens up the vistas of the boys' imaginations it is a fine little film one deserving of a wide audience grady harp january 07	23

1	i have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents yes the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities but this is exactly something i want to read and evaluate the marketplace of business opportunities many of these are franchise opportunities which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start the articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful but not all the value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process it was not until i read the e myth revisited that i understood the value of these franchises this magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy the magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there	23

1	of course dead alive was the better movie but i think the comparisons to the peter jackson masterpiece are appropriate due to the fact that there is a high body count lots of over the top splattery deaths and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers some as zombie lunch apparently there was some footage cut out for this release i'm not sure if that was gore footage or not but i would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence there is even some non gore quot grossout quot humor \( vomit related etc \) that reminded me of bad taste as well as dead alive sorry to run the peter jackson comparison into the ground but again the influence is unquestionable do n't expect the fx quality of dead alive though this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly i do n't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print transfer but it 's a minor distraction they did a great job with a relatively small budget i echo the other reviewers who would like to see ittenbach 's other films on us \( hopefully uncut \) dvd release i 've heard burning moon is especially crazy	23
1	i have been a long time subscriber to vogue knitting it was one of the few us knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns i am from germany where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns i missed that when i moved to the us however i find that the content in vogue knitting really fluctuated sometimes it was packed with great designs sometimes it was just too far out and there was n't a single pattern i wanted to knit i stopped my subscription for a while then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle not too funky yet still chic and fun i still enjoy reading it every once in a while after having my daughter i changed my subscription to family circle easy knitting since vogue knitting does not carry any patterns for babies or kids which i really find a shame i even wrote a letter to the editor saying that this was a major omission especially because it is very hard to find chic and elegant kids knits in magazines not those acrylic yarn patterns with bears on them ! the german magazines do a great job of having some unique but still fun kids designs if you want a very trendy knitting magazine that uses a whole range of yarns \( some very expensive \) then vogue knitting is the magazine for you if you are looking for elegant knits that are more functional but still challenging i would suggest interweave knits and rebecca \( english version of a german magazine \) both carry some really interesting and challenging patterns if you have kids there is n't much out there i would suggest family circle easy knitting also rebecca does a kids issue once a year which should not be missed	23
1	i purchased the adorama slinger bag after first purchasing the tamrac velocity 5 the tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag unfotunately it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle the slinger bag addressed both of these deficiencies when worn as a waist bag it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag there are two water pouches on the slinger bag \( which is a real requirement as i live in arizona \) the adorama slinger bag is a great travel bag it is light weight and has great utility i highly recommend it	23
1	dave alvin 's sublime new cd is a cadre of songs written by californians either born and or who grew up in this land the lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises it is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state dave alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said infiltrates your brain like a shot of jack daniels dave alvin says we started with a list of 25 songs from steve gillette to captain beefheart and everything in between i was even thinking of doing 'going back to cali' as a blues thing in the end though it was n't about choosing my favorite songs so much as choosing songs that i could sing well enough and arrange differently enough to make them interesting he has picked these songs carefully and each of them fit his style and voice well of them all and i like each and every one my two favorite interpretations are here in california and surfer girl california bloodlines is a sentimental rendition of john stewart 's fine work which finds peace in knowing there 's california bloodlines in my heart there 's a california woman in my song and a california heartbeat in my soul redneck friend the jackson brown less well known song was just right for dave alvin 's style kern river is a song merle haggard wrote after losing his best friend and it is a melancholy rendition blind love from tom waits is sung in a bluesy style with some doo wops thrown in to give it style here in california one of my favorites is sung with christy mcwilson he felt this song needed a woman 's perspective i'm bewildered is an old richard berry the great guitarist 's tune backed up by the calvenes sonora 's death row written by blackie ferrell is a fable that examines the price of acting out of greed and anger and ends up a as gun fighter 's tale down on the riverbed is an old los lobos song that is sung in dave alvin 's old blues style between the cracks a song written by dave alvin and tom russell is a heartbreaking tale of young boy told by a loving woman with a rollicking tune this is the only dave alvin orignal song in this cd do n't look now a song sung by john fogerty is an old creedence clearwater revival bluesy and fun to make it dave 's tramps and hawkers by jim ringer is a delicate country waltz come dance with me bk lyrics are wonderful loser by jerry garcia and robert hunter is darker with more infused blues than garcia 's version it could n't sound less like a deadhead song dave alvin put in a psychedelic section that is a tribute to the san francisco sound surfer girl brian wilson 's first song is done with doo wops and again the calvanes did background this is my favorite of dave alvin 's interpretations and he sings this surfin 'song with some tongue in cheek dave alvin gives voices of california to this cd voices from the california coastline and the surf music it inspired to the brown earth of the state to the frontier life and the lives won and lost dave alvin had made his mark on this state and the writers who loved their lives by writing and singing about the state they love play it often and pay attention to the subtle influence of this cd california dreamin' \? highly recommended prisrob 6 04 06	23

1	i have to say that i picked this one episode out of the many as an example of the talent of these two gentleman if you see comedy and want comedy that is more direct and honest in how it portrays different groups this is the series i enjoy their skits and think that it simply pokes fun without being mean that is hard to do the different characters they take on makes me think there is more than two guys they are that good in my humble opinion you do not need to be an anglophile for the series but it would really help to be an anglophile valley girl for the vicky skit	23

1	this is a light and colorful newspaper i remember when it first came out the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country the reporting itself is clear and very readable the paper lacks weight and depth it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers	24

1	i use this magazine for my three kids \( ages 9 11 and 13 \) who are homeschooled they love the magazine because it makes history more fun than dry textbooks and they get to really experience what life was like in a certain era each article includes discussion questions activities movies web sites and additional books to read what is so great about this is that when one of the kids is really interested in something they can jump off and explore more on their own perfect for self directed learning and it saves me time in tracking down this stuff some of the more memorable articles were ones like how to storm a castle hobo signs in the depression success in ancient china and how chocolate conquered europe definitely not standard fare topics but fun nonetheless my kids are getting hooked on history as a result ! sure it 's 5 per issue but it 's pretty thick \( 60 pages \) and has no ads you can check out a sample issue online on their web site to see if it is right for your kids	24

0	do n't buy this camera really i had it for a month and was taking good care of it i was initially thrilled the lcd screen got damaged no i did n't drop it the treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that i was shocked the customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if i were an idiot a 181 repair bill for a 300 camera is not feasible it was a great camera at first but i demand better treatment and respect from the company look for a better camera look on the web for comments on their customer service and do n't buy this camera i had read very negative things about sony but did n't think they applied they really are true i do n't like being called a liar by anyone especially when i am the customer the camera is a month old and it is now garbage while i understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty i will not accept such poor treatment and customer service i teach photography and will tell my students the same thing if customer service and respect matter to you then do not buy this camera	24
0	what a complete pain ! we now use macs however i decided to take the california bar examination july 2006 the california bar examiners allow the use of laptops utilizing a software program written by examsoft presently the software will only work on windows xp moreover the california bar examiners will not allow any macs even the newer macs with the intel processors which require complete re booting into windows as a result i was forced to upgrade my gateway laptop a fine laptop as far as pcs are concerned in order to sit for this bar examination \( that or purchase a new laptop which was probably the point \) thank god for gateway computer technical support as the microsoft folks are clueless even though the warranty on my gateway laptop expired some time ago gateway has walked me through more issues during the installation process than i can possibly discuss here conversely microsoft simply bounces me around from one tech support person to the next until the telephone becomes disconnected i suspect that the marketing strategy is that new software \( any new software \) will only work with the newer versions of windows xp or vista and since vista will be such a memory hog consumers eventually will be forced to dump their pcs which cannot be upgraded for new pcs as for how the operating system actually works a grade of fair yesterday the microsoft update website was down which according to microsoft's discussion website seemed to be a problem with other window users as well typical	24

1	this is a useful tool in that it makes the software hardware combination available at a less expensive price than any other i am aware of my only criticism is that there is not a lot of information on interpretation of the output although from reading heart math literature one can get a sense of what one is doing however for the price it is definitely worth it and i could see that some people may want to get the game mostly for the option of having this expansion pack	24

0	greatest hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact but this wears thin with repeated listenings this is especially true of gangsta rap with what allegedly should represent the best work of b t h on one disk this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself arranged back to back the rapid fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin the raps blur together and after two songs the obscenity laced machine gun vocal play loses its novelty value sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention all that remains are the rhythm tracks which are serviceable at best their biggest hit tha crossroads appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better known form further reducing the value of this collection worse they include a warmed over version of f tha police an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of nwa 's original spending money on this collection is like buying old newspaper articles it might have had some value when it first hit the stands but who wants yesterday 's papers \? c tom rya	24

0	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be 1 in ranking often the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that is n't relevant or does n't make sense or the review is n't consistent with the posted viehicle stats the magazine also seems to be biased some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful after further reading of many issues you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers for example you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically trash and a japanese brand or a bmw is always the way to go when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews ultimately its a bad guide towards getting any information on automobiles period its the pat robertson of auto magazines if it were possible i woudl n't even give this magazine 1 star	24
1	combine the high iso low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light and moving subjects this is what only fuji can offer to you on compact camera class the f31fd does n't have is \( image stabilized lenses or a ccd shift sensor \) which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking but this kind of stabilization is really only useful for 6x or more zoom for just 3x typical zoom on ultra compact p s you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results is also ca n't prevent blur from moving subjects with a high iso like on f31fd you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too fuji super ccd sensor provides the lowest noise on high iso you will find on 2007 's compact cameras the quality is only comparable to the big dslr professional cameras ah and the face detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal it 's really great specially if someone who does n't know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you with f31fd they will not miss the shot	24

1	this being my first badger brush i do n't know how competent a reviewer i can be but i am really happy with it it is large enough to hold a lot of foam \( sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much \) it is fairly heavy and robust which i also like i 've been using it for about 6 months now and have a feeling that it is going to last for years make sure to hang it to dry and wash it thoroughly after each use for anybody who is new to the wonderful world of shaving with a brush i highly recommend this page as a intro	24

0	i bought the game couple of weeks ago i was hesitating on buying it initially but finally i did because of all the good hype about the game i wish i did n't buy it to be fair i have to admit that the game has astonishing landscape cities and the level of details in the game i do n't think i have ever seen suhc creativity and perfectness in earlier games i am sure that are lot of people that will find such features enaough for them to adore the game for me landscape is not enough since the largest downside is the story if there is any story from my perspective i have abandoned playing after closing the 4th or 5th oblivion gate i do n't see any excitment in playing the game any further i explored most of the cities though quite quickly the conversation looks silly that every time the camre will zoom in to the person you are chating with it was nice the first couple of times but then i am waiting for my sweet gothic3 to go out honestly i would prefer playing gothic1 on playing oblivion just to tell you about the action excitment i am talking about i would like to say that when i got gothic2 i played for almost 36 hours straight no food no sleep just drink water and play play and lots of play	24

1	if you 're looking to hear robert johnson 's songs you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible as this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years i'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs and talk about his life that 's all we have now and of course the covers do not outdo him that would be impossible but there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of robert johnson and the world he lived in the discussion with a former classmate is touching and the covers of his songs by those who knew him \( robert lockwood jr honeyboy edwards \) and by some of the new delta blues talent such as guy davis roy rogers and especially alvin youngblood heart blew me away gov't mule and sonny landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work the major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n' roll hall of fame gathering and also bob weir 's performance which is just plain bad all in all it is a good film and it 's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music as we will never be able to see the real thing	24

0	i purchased my version of el hazard from a zshop for 19 bucks and i am so glad that i did that said the first series is worth watching for two main reasons overt lesbianism and jinnai the former is self explanatory while the latter \( jinnai \) is without a doubt the best character in the series \( despite the fact that he is the antagonist \) you ca n't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed but throughout the first series jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed out character as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature this superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story 's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging and this is what makes the second series \( all four dismal episodes \) so tragic they nerfed jinnai he could never have been called a genius in the first series but he was decidedly intelligent cool pragmatic supremely self confident and an effective leader \( even though he was also manic and delusional \) in el hazard ii as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain they have turned jinnai into a slapstick idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon i suggest purchasing el hazard through alternate means watching the first series and discarding the second let 's face it even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty	24

0	this device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising but does absolutely nothing it says it does the unit is hard to install for beginners it is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather if there is low sunlight or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows even factory shading it does not work you must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun \? \?	24

0	tim lahaye jerry jenkins and others in the pre trib circle such as ed hindson tommy ice chuck missler etc continue to put forth the same deceptions that hal lindsey popularized decades ago the notion of a pre tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture it is foreign to the teachings of the early church and it is grooming the church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming these men are novices and not prophecy experts or scholars by any stretch of the imagination they are those who tickle the ears of gullible christians why continue to be deceived \? tim cohen in his excellent book the antichrist and a cup of tea provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming antichrist is known now not only that the same author \( tim cohen \) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture ever offered to the saints of god in christ the real rapture if you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture then you need to hear tim cohen 's the real rapture \( based on a volume in his forthcoming messiah history and the tribulation period series \( see prophecy house 's web site for details on these items \)	24

0	on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums \( i think it is shaker \) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert that should have been as far as it went to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery if these are blues songs then i am robert johnson 's illegitimate son death letter is good maybe even great but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard the rest is a waste of time the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd these are my first 2 reviews by the way but all these 5 star reviews for both cd 's finally got me motivated go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain	24
1	to echo another reviewer i am a heavy runner with high \( semi flexible \) arches and a neutral stride running 20 35 miles per week even though my strides are consistent in terms of length pronation and heal to toe gait i tend to have very heavy footfalls \( being a former sprinter with muscular legs \) and need a well cushioned shoe i am training for the boston marathon and have tried asics gel kayanos \( the shoe designed for the clydesdale type runner \) a pair of adidas adistars \( the newest model is a very good shoe but did n't fit my wider foot properly \) and some various pairs of new balance \( least favorites of the bunch \) but the mizuno wave 7 's are by far the most natural feeling durable light weight cushioned \( without being bulky \) shoe i have ever owned i have now owned two of the wave creation 7 's and a pair of the older wave creation 6 's and put a lot of miles on these shoes they consistently hold up mile after mile better than any of the other shoes out there the gel kayanos are the only shoe remotely comparable but i found that they break down far to fast for distance running \( and they are slightly heavy \) that and the mizuno 's were comfortable from the first step and did not require any breaking which is very rare i am confident i could switch to a new pair a week before a marathon and hardly notice a difference i would not only highly recommend this shoe to anyone with medium to heavy footfalls and a high arch but i endorse it as the only shoe i will buy as long as the line continues	24
1	my husband a non celiac eat this pancake mix \( to make waffles \) all the time the recipe calls for egg whites to be beaten until stiff so it is a bit more work than many other mixes but it is worth it ! the result tastes like real waffles kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles but the texture is n't as nice	24
1	i was a little reluctant to purchase these because i had heard a lot of things about the spring mechanism in them being faulty but that they were being recalled and fixed so i was wondering if the one i bought was a fixed model or not well it must have the newer design because i 've been using these for a few months and i have nothing but good things to say about them i was previously using a long oxo set of tongs which were pretty good but a little flimsy for some of the heftier cuts of meat like whole chickens and pork shoulders these tongs are sturdy ! you know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them they can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and because of the 20 inch length you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire the handle has grooves for your fingers and thumbs which enhances the grip and they lock in a closed position for storage if you do any outdoor cooking you will appreciate these tongs they 're a well thought out piece of equipment you 'll use for years and be glad you purchased	24

1	a remarkable introduction to ezra pound makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the cantos periplous ideogram fugue the 'repeat in history' and gives concise readings of individual sections that helped my understanding enormously he does an especially good job of connecting pound 's theory of money to his views on sex and creativity makin manages to be critical of pound while treating his ideas with verve and sympathy the writing is colloquial witty and jargon free i enjoyed the cantos much more after reading this short effective study	24

1	i'm the first to confess that i had never heard any of any of the actors starring in the 1951 robert wise gothic noir the house on telegraph hill but it does n't matter because all the actors are good and combined with an extremely effective plot the movie is a terrific tale of murder deceit and assumed identities in post world war san francisco as was the fashion with many noir films of the time the house on telegraph hill is told in flashback with a voice over from the heroine she tells of her house that is empty and is up for sale and one immediately assumes that something terrible has happened however the narrative soon jumps to germany at the end of the war and we meet victoria kopwelska \( valentina cortese \) is a polish woman imprisoned in belsen with her husband and family dead victoria tells the kindly american commander major marc bennett \( william lundigan \) that there 's nothing for her back in poland desperate to survive victoria learns that her best friend has family in the united states and if they are ever freed she promises to take victoria to america with her her friend however is killed shortly before american troops can liberate the camp with nowhere to go victoria hatches a scheme to steal her friend 's papers and sail to america where she learns now the godmother to a young boy chris \( gordon gebert \) as well as the heir to a sizable fortune and a gorgeously gothic house high atop telegraph hill following the death of her aunt ensconced in the ostensible mansion victoria now dressing in glamorous frocks and drinking expensive champagne marries the boy 's guardian alan spender \( richard basehart \) partly out of desperation and partly out of the need for security as victoria becomes a mother to the boy she clashes with his governess margaret \( fay baker \) and coincidently reconnects with marc whom she met a belsen now a studly a playboy type lawyer all the adults are not as they seem marc has been making secret plans to get his hands on the money and victoria 's arrival causes him to draft a new scheme victoria begins to believe that her new sweetheart is up to no good and then there 's the margaret the furtive outsider and whether her allegiances to chris are all they seem the film is compelling and tension fuelled and beautifully shot in black and white cortese is especially good in one of her first american roles and as victoria she frantically tries to keep up her masquerade yet through no fault of her own she steadily becomes a victim of alan 's scheming of particular note are the stunning location shots of san francisco the main house is just beautiful and the scenes when victoria is playing baseball with chris offer stunning views of san francisco bay the house on telegraph hill ultimately serves as one of the better noir thrillers there 's a runaway car poisoned orange juice an enigmatic and jealous housekeeper and a false identity it all makes for a gripping and entertaining film victoria starts out as a victim and although she schemes and lies her way into the house on telegraph hill her ability to rise above the nefarious misdeeds enable her to achieve a kind of redemption for both her and chris mike leonard april 06	24
1	this is a good tool does the job well and serves the purpose but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer i give a 4 star because of canon not because of the product if you are willing to pay for it it 's a good product	24
1	i personally have n't heard a peep about silverstone in ages and frankly when i bought this item i did n't even realize it was made by them i needed new muffin pans so i just looked for the best deal price wise i saw this set and figured it was as good as any when i received them i was ecstatic when you think of something relatively trivial like this you do n't really expect much in the way of quality but man was i wrong ! these things are weighty very well constructed and have durable written all over them i consider it a huge upgrade from my old flimsy no name tins and i highly recommend them for anyone who like me bakes a lot and really just does n't want to worry about replacing these kinds of things too often	24
0	watching the razor release \( which i bought to save a few dollars \) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times fortunately i was able to find the much praised version released by era of taiwan from a seller here on amazon and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog sheer perfection	24

0	in case you 're wondering the aforementioned 'suckers' are anybody who paid to see this movie and i dont mean just in a theater i count myself in because it cost me 3 79 at my video store ! looking back i should have given that money to a homeless person then went home and stared at a wall while playing suspenseful music ! i would have gotten the same effect of watching this pretentious piece of garbage ! this guy sucks ! ! seriously his talent level should place him as a writer for the sci fi channel maybe he could write a few decent outer limits or twilight zone episodes \? \? but he is in over his head when it comes to big budget movies and where the f did the budget go \? has the the price of 'monster suits' \( signs anyone \? \) increased to the multimillion dollar range \? my guess is he pocketed half of it and the other half went to the unwitting actors who 's agents suckered them into this sham of a film if you read the 'quotes n trivia' on amazon 's link you will find that \( a \) kirsten dunst bailed out on this sinking ship \( good thinking girl \) and \( b \) sigourney weaver had nightmares after she read the script obviously she had already committed spoiler short summary of the incredibly unfeasible plot a bunch of people from the city who have had deaths in the family do the logical thing and go live in a wildlife preserve \( although we see no animals in it \) undetected by authorites long enough to raise children whom they traumatize into never leaving the village by dressing in monster suits and other scary tricks anyone ever seen a scooby doo episode \? then 1 guy stabs another and they send a blind girl \( with 2 guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately \) to go get medicine through the forbidden forest \( how she is supposed to acquire multiple stab wound effective medicine is up to her \) but the 1st guy she meets gets it for her no problem and helps her back over the wall into the park ! and the cult lives on seriously thats the plot i 've read that he stole this plot from the book 'running out of time' not to mention the scooby doo thing or his camera style which he takes from hitchcock this guy is a hack folks	24
0	i had to buy this book for a class it is an extremely boring read and i struggle to keep myself awake while reading it \( as does the rest of the class i am told \) it does tell you about dreamweaver though and i suppose that is its purpose one thing that i do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing internet explorer and other isp 's his personal opinions are a real turn off and unnecessary	24
0	worked alright for a few months i was n't especially pleased with the shave quality i e skin irritation hair pulls i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads it did n't the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair was n't easy and resulted in breakage no doubt due to the cheap plastic used never again	24
1	i recently purchased this clock and it 's a great little clock ! the time and temp are cool features as well as the projection which is very cool and useful the projection \( usually on the ceiling \) is not too bright to hurt your eyes when sleeping or awakening the only problem with the projection is that unless you have the clock on the side the numbers project upside down i mean to say that if you have it facing you straight ahead the numbers will be above the clock upside down the atomic feature was a bit tricky also i live in central nj and when setting up the clock for the first time it did n't pick up any signal after i searched for a signal took the batteries out and tried everything i knew and everything the manual mentioned it would n't get a signal so i had to write an email to the company and they sent me a response with several suggestions the one that worked and was most useful was to search for a signal \( by pressing the down arrow \) and then while its searching place it where it can recieve full signal which is shown by the meter on the left like a cell phone once you get enough signal let it sit there until it sets itself \( you may need to take it outside \) this can take from 10 mins to days in my case it took about 5 mins so it set the signal and the company says once it sets you can put it where you want and it will keep the signal other than that problem which is fixed the clock is hassle free and very easy to use i highly recommend it oregon scientific was also helpful and i sent them a thank you email stressing that they need to put more signal suggestions in the manual because if they did i would n't have needed to bother email the customer service hopefully most people did n't give up that easily and kept trying to get the signal to set if they did n't they may have returned the clock needlessly the alarm is loud enough for me to awaken and the snooze button is useful and on the top so it 's can be reached easily in a drowsy stupor overall it 's a cute useful and stylish clock	24

1	i love this birdbath i 've had it several months and it has n't tarnished at all due to the review about it being 'tippy' i added extra weight to it by putting sand in the column and then sealing the bottom so it could n't escape it has n't tipped over yet and we 've had some bad storms in the midwest highly recommend i am adding to my original post 2 2007 do n't make the mistake that i did in thinking this was a copper birdbath my search term was 'copper birdbath' and i did n't notice that this says copper finish some metal gray spots are starting to show up in the bowl of the birdbath i should have read the description more carefull	24

0	very lightweight fragile and poorly finished not sure what the hardwood actually is it looks oak like but is far too lightweight for it 's size it came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time the lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off i only used it for kata did n't feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills after a few months of very little use mostly sitting on the rack it began to develop cracks perhaps it was n't dried properly when they applied the finish \? regardless the one i received \( 50 model \) was cheap junk you get what you pay for not only not recommended but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it spend a little more to get better quality	24
1	i'm black have kinky hair and i 've been relaxing my hair for about 25 years i 've used many many types of relaxers to my dismay hair falling out breaking dry etc so i let my hair rest for about 5 years then i tried the relaxer thing again after i found phyto i 've been doing my own hair now for about 1 year and it 's been great ! except for the price my hair still feels as if it has life in it it it is not breaking it is not falling out it burns like regular straightener i use vinegar to neutralize it then use the neutralizing shampoo with indicator to check for pink please there 's not enough neutralizing shampoo to get rid of the staraightener the price is scary but i'm more afraid of having my hair fall out and having to fix that soon i 'll have to get a hairdresser though because my hair has now been retaining it 's length and growing and it 's harder to straighten it myself	24

1	we 've seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays	24
0	i thoroughly enjoyed the author 's earlier work on how the irish saved civilization but this book was a disappointing compendium of greek myths legends and history that never reveals a plan behind the book taken in its subparts many sections are engagingly informative in an elegant if sometimes pretentious prose yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight where 's the big picture \? the author attempts to wrap it up at the end with a sentence about the greeks' variety of human response lightening quick transmutations resourcefulness and inexhaustible creativity a subtitle like a greek treasury of personal vignettes might have been more descriptive and merited another star but it falls short as a hinge of history with impoverished and even maladaptive connections \( fdr as solon really \? \) to the modern world i am sorry to not recommend it	24
0	i bought one of the custom tile 7 's \( loaded with options \) from california and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self destruct i tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years until they skipped to mexico tiles just did n't fall off they spalted the fire box broke etc when it got too bad to use and look at we had to throw it away a 1500 mistake if there was a really good ceramic cooker out there i would try it again they cook like a dream	24

0	had trouble finding out how to put it together then the motor started and would not stop had trouble getting the bottom in the right angle to stop it and then the slightest movement and it would go on again i would return it but it is too heavy to move heavy to move to make it change to mop part from brush part and making the motor stop was a formidable task i will let he battery run out and try it a few more times and try to use it just as a heavy mop that should not take too long	24

0	all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane 's life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane 's life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is at best an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice accused murder suspect in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane 's extracurricular activities my interest in the film was as a hogan's heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six year series bob crane 's professional credits alone would make for a good film auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane 's so called secret life and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane 's private life auto focus however should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan's heroes television series	24

0	the civ name has been tarnished analogously one thing i have been learning is that just because sid meier 's name is on a product it does n't mean the product is good in the case of civcity rome unfortunately it does n't just come in at modestly good it comes in at dismally poor i 've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about civilization in general but after civ4 came out i am starting to believe that firaxis games and sid meier are on their way out and now this i regret to inform that the great civ titles were made a long time ago the offerings of today have a simple pattern the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should obviously have been included in the original release they take advantage of our love for the franchise this pattern is so evident that the whole sid meier and civ franchise is degenerating it almost seems especially with the release of civcity rome that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old but the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games ! stay away from civcity rome besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good the narration and sound effects better or the interface to work properly the game is a dismal failure and i am sorry to report that it seems like firefly studios had an idea and got the license from firaxis but they just cheesed it watching what maxis \( the sims and simcity franchises \) and firaxis \( civilization franchise \) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk	24

1	this potty is just right for our little boy he seemed comfortable from the first time we placed him on it his little feet touch the ground and the shape notonly supports him but also protects for little boy mishaps and gives him something to hold on to while bearing down i would definitely recommend this especially if you are starting early !	24
0	i do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod come to find out this model does not have a fluid head meaning if you do any panning with a camcorder it wo n't be as smooth as you 'd probably like it to be also at the end of a pan the head tends to unwind causing your panned image to back up a little ways thus i think it 's rather misleading to label this as a photo video tripod additionally i do n't really care for the cheap feel of some of the plastic knobs and adjusters finally mine came with a few very minor cosmetic blemishes almost as if it were used instead of video i 'll be utilizing this one as a microphone mount if you want to do video please buy a tripod with a fluid head you 'll love it i guarantee that that 's why i give this one 2 stars	24
1	yeah johnny must 've been drinking heavily during this recording it 's evident in his slurred lyrics it 's raining is the song where he sounds totally wasted although you can get the sense that he is infact quite happy and very relaxed but all this inebriation actually adds to the authenticity of this c d johnny winter really becomes the archetypal bluesman on this c d his guitar work is quite sparse no long solos on this one but nevertheless the feel on this album is wonderful i have to say this also johnny must 've been very very brave to release this album back in 1977 that was a very bad year for the blues appalling infact disco music was king alot of bluesmen like johnny guitar watson etc were opting for the commercialism of the disco dance floor johnny might 've thought of releasing a commercial type rock album like edgar was doing instead he chose to stay faithful to the blues and i have to admire the determination and resolve of johnny winter very few would 've stayed faithful to the blues the last track with muddy waters walking thru the park captures johnny in his element he was so happy back then and it filters over into the song itself i remember seeing them both do this song live at the capitol radio festival alexander palace london england in july 1977 never again to be repeated sadly	24

1	i have now seen about twenty asian horror films and this series definitely ranks among the best i have written more extensive reviews under the individual titles but suffice it to say that these movies make audition look like a disney romance bleak bizarre and ultra violent yet surprisingly stylish and intelligent this film maker has something to say and will beat you senseless to make his point in short if you want to see ringu 25 stay away from this one if you feel a bit more adventurous i highly recommend this series	24
0	i like films that push things to the edge and address taboos so i was looking forward to this exploration of kink sadomasochism and nazism written and directed both by women hey it sure promised to be original you ca n't say oh not another movie about a female concentration camp prisoner who grows fond of her tormentor and wants to continue their sadomasochistic relationship a decade later but despite all the promise of debauchery and a probing of the dark side of human nature the night porter after the first 40 minutes at least comes off as a confused muddled nonsensical and ultimately unintentionally comic film with an arbitrary ending that seemed to happen only because the filmmakers looked at their watch and said we 're coming up on two hours the first part of the film where lucia recognizes her old captor now a humble night porter at a vienna hotel is well done while i found dirk bogarde to be a little wooden charlotte rampling is perfect as the woman you can still see the scars but she does n't overplay them there 's quiet dignity but also the capacity to feel pain a scene where she goes to the opera and sees bograde watching her and flashes back to her predicament as she absent mindedly rubs her once chained wrists is understated too bad the rest is n't on that level unfortunately this understatement soon gives way to a second half that 's ridiculously over the top bogarde belongs to a sort of support group for ex nazi camp officers and together they try to buck each other up as well as destroy evidence of their past crimes i found this subplot laughable i doubt real nazi guards ever participated in dr phil type rap sessions there 's another sub plot about a gay former ss guard who 's now a ballerina and dances for bogarde i found this subplot bizarre this thread sort of fizzles out halfway through the movie and i'm at a loss as to why it was there in the first place then there 's the main plot line which as i said startes off interestingly but gets pretty silly by the second half wherein bogarde and rampling find themselves cut off from food and being shot at by the other former ss guards like insurgents holed up in a hideout if that sounds weird it is weird the second half makes no literal sense and one of the former ss guards himself points out the foibles in bograde 's actions \( chain can be cut \) yet the film asks us to continue to take it seriously then the ending just comes out of the blue with no explanation sorry but this was n't an exploration into the decadence or dark side of the human soul or of ss decadence this was sexploitation in nazi garb the flashback where rampling dances for the officers in the bar though sexy in a perverse sort of way is also silly she 's supposed to be this meek and frightened concentration camp victim yet she 's dancing like she was born to it i do n't see an exploration of anything i just see an attempt at sexy sadomasochism rampling is so good she almost sells me on this but the others are rather stiff some of the dialogue is laughable and the second half is all disjointed for once criterion drops the ball in terms of presentation the non anamorphic dvd utilizes a somewhat faded beat up print the sound is not very good even for 1974 mono there are no extras at all not even a trailer not a commentary nada if this is an attempt to explore and examine our dark side an analysis by the filmmaker or a film scholar would have been welcome maybe that person could have made heads or tails of this story 's resolution i cannot and i cannot recommend this disc very strongly it only has rampling 's performance to redeem it and in the end that 's not quite enough	24
0	i love my medela pump in style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful the twist tie closure is complicated they also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing i recommend the lansinoh bags they have an easy to use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it 's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing you can also lay them flat to freeze so they wo n't take up much space in the freezer they pour great no spills !	24

1	unlike any other game you 've ever played in the best possible way i am easily bored and or grossed out by the traditional racing shooting killing zombie games and this game was a refreshing change challenging enough to keep you entertained for quite a long time other reviewers have said it ends too soon but the game lets you repeat each level to beat your previous best score so if you barely beat the level you can do it over until you have totally blown it out of the water perfect for a pair of obsessive compulsives like my fianc and me he thought it looked stupid when we bought it but now he plays it more than i do and his 6 going on 7 year old son loves it too there is n't anything that would be inappropriate for any age but a kid younger than 6 or 7 probably would n't get it \( after he goes to bed we play the insanely gory jaws game you get to be the shark ! ! \) you might think that rolling up stuff to make a big ball would get old fast but the king of all cosmos keeps it exciting with the challenges and surprises the levels just get cooler and cooler also the music is fantastic it will have you singing along in no time na na na na na na na na katamari damashi ! it does n't even make sense but i love it ! i just ordered the second katamari game we love katamari `nuff said	24

0	i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided why not \? \? its been a year and although the previews of each week 's prime time programs are fun \( 2 pages worth \) i was very dissapointed the articles are empty boring and some downright retarded rehashing show 's dialogues requoteing newscomments its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around i realize this is an entertainment magazine but still the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison gasp ! ! ! do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide much more interestin	24
1	i love this game for what it is you cannot expect this to be anything like madden but it is still a fun game injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced fast paced something i cannot say about the loading this game is the slowest loading game i have ever played it actually took three minutes for it to load one time get this game provided that you can wait a little bit	24
0	this toy barely gets used in our house it has a very low to the floor design my 18 month old daughter has to hunch just to play with it the sounds and characters are cute but clunky and not very realistic i am very dissatisfied with this purchase not worth the investment if you are looking for a fisher price doll house for your youngster i would suggest checking out fisher price my first dollhouse it has a higher design with more realistic characters not so clunky i wish we would have purchased this one instead	24
0	one of the handles would not go in the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when i would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction they told me to send it back for a replacement and i'm still waiting and waiting ! ! ! so i would rate this unit a 0 how do i get my monies back \? \? \?	24
1	i purchased this camera a year ago \( summer 05 \) definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect there are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera but after a year mine is still working perfectly	24
0	i tried to like this product as previous reviews have said it has significant design limitations if you only need a 2d floorplan there are better tools for the same money or less the object libraries that come with the tool furniture fabrics etc are really lame this limits it 's value as an interior design tool i did not attempt to return it so i cannot comment on their return policy	24
0	sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct does n't work the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work i was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module it does n't hold it in rotational position	24
0	i 've used paperport for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options however version 11 is buggier than earlier versions every time i launch a microsoft office product the paperport installer starts up there is no reference to this in the paperport help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the paperport site another bug imprints a trial copy legend on your pdf files this one is explained in the knowledgebase but requires you to tinker with the registry to correct it that 's a bit ridiculous why are they distributing code with a known bug \? nuance expects you to pay 9 95 for e mail technical support even if it 's a bug in their own product the product is a modest performer at best but nuance 's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here i 've requested an rma for a refund jerr	24

1	the strap links on these g shocks are quite oversized when i first got it i could fit the watch around my legs ! \( you 'll most likely have to get the links adjusted \) ironically the four side buttons on the watch is small so even if you have a huge wrist you 'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons ! \( not for huge fingers \) beware the picture shows the four side buttons on the watch in silver but the left and right side buttons on this model is actually plain black ! it is quite misleading ! the silver side button is actually the mtg920dj model \( which is the 2005 version \) according to casio the mtg920da was actually released in 2004 with black side buttons if you search the casio website it will only display the mtg920dj \( their most recent version \) most websites that still sell the mtg920da are just taking the latest mtg920dj version picture from casio 's website the mtg920dj seems to have the same features as this one \( mtg920da \) except the four side \( left and right \) buttons are in silver for those of you wondering about the three circles on the watch the first one on the very left is basically a wannabe analog display basically every five minutes a bar increases \( or decreases when it gets full \) it 's just mostly there for cosmetic reasons the second one in the middle is the battery status it has an l \( low \) m \( medium \) and h \( high \) and the bar would display in one of those areas if you get out in the sun a lot or know an area in your home where the sun shines a lot then you wo n't have a problem with the battery ever going below high moreover it has a power saving feature the watch will go into sleep mode \( display off \) when it is in a completely dark area for a long time finally the third circle on the very right is where it tells you what options are enabled disabled it shows spl \( split time for stopwatch \) dst \( daylight saving time \) sig \( hourly signal \) alm \( alarm \) snz \( snooze \) and auto el \( automatic electro luminescent backlight the backlight turns on by tilting it a certain degree towards your face without having to manually press the backlight button \) keep in mind synchronizing with the atomic signal is not instant it usually takes around 3 minutes \( at least for me i live in california \) and if you 're in a busy area or near an electronic it might be difficult try again or move to a different area moreover it should show you the strength level \( 4 levels \) of the signal \( while you 're synchronizing \) with a satellite icon on the watch there is also a feature that automatically synchornizes for you while you 're sleeping at 2 00am 3 00am 4 00am and 5 00am therefore it 's not always necessary to syncronize it yourself because by the time you wake up it should be ready to go overall this watch is attractive and fun to wear the atomic radio signal feature is very cool having the official time is great right to the precise second ! i 've had this watch for months now and i enjoy wearing it daily this watch does have a lot of feature except it 's a pity it does not have a countdown timer ! pros cool design water scratch resistant g shock are known for their toughest watches \( update i 've worn this watch daily for almost a year and a half now and not a single scratch still looks brand new ! \) solar power battery life is excellent never had the power ever go below high power saving feature position of the time and date is easy to read at one glance metal strap can display world time with local timecons the side buttons are small and tight to press \( must use like the very tip of the fingers \) atomic signal takes too long manually and it usually is not possible to synchronize while wearing the watch if you 're inside the home it is usually best to take off the watch and leave it near a window alarm beep can be a little longer perhaps \( even my inexpensive timex watch would beep and it would gradually beep faster which i actually like a bit better \) no countdown timer \( how could they forget this \? ! \) also try to research other models instead of finding out the hard way \( like i did about the side buttons \) before purchasing	24
0	i struggle with this movie i'm a die hard fan of jean claude van damme so part of me really likes this movie but the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct to video with a slow script uninteresting characters and horrendously bad acting \( save for jcvd himself \) having said this i can honestly reccomend it to fans of van damme they will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from brussles kick the tar out of some low life hicks while drinking with his indian buddy and pickin' up chicks if this appeals to you there should n't be any reason why you would n't like desert heat if even one of this does n't sound good stay far away	24
0	i purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down next the piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy the first time the wind picked up it blew the whole thing apart so for a one time use it is okay the money spent on this was a waste it also looked in places like it had already been repaired \( seconds \) as in 2nd class merchandise	24

0	my son received this car for christmas and i was appalled amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery which was no problem getting but as for the 9 v turbo battery and charger good luck finding that i bought it when it was on sale for 19 99 and the original price said it was 59 99 so i thought that i was getting a deal huge mistake ! i did n't know that i would have to purchase an additional 20 battery no wonder why it was only 19 99 ! its a piece of junk i also got the batboat but i'm afraid to see what that might need my advice dont get it	24

1	i am obviously addicted to philosophy but it 's a good addiction my skin looks great better than it ever has in my life ! whenever i feel like doing something for myself i try a new philosophy product because it 's sure to give me a lift this product is called a microdelivery peel but i view \( and use \) it more as a toner philosophy 's two part microdelivery peel is awesome and i would not attempt to replace it with these pads with the two part peel you clean your face with purity made simple cleanser then massage in the abrasive crystals after a few minutes you squeeze out a little of the liquid which mixes with the crystals on your face and heats up infusing your skin with vitamin c and other healthy goodies that is a real peel ! these little pads on the other hand are cool refreshing and subtle you can use them every day and they wo n't make your skin red they freshen your skin and you know they contain great things that will help your skin because they are made by philosophy	24
1	after having purchased a 3 burner kenmore grill about 5 years ago and on my second replacement set of burners i decided it was time to invest in a quality gas grill when i looked at the webers 5 years ago they were quite pricey and not knowing much about grills i said heck no ! well live and learn after replacing burners twice at around 70 each time and the kenmore flavorizer bars at 40 all in 5 years i decided to bite the bullet and spend the cash after lots of research on lots of websites i went with the gold b so far it 's been great warranty and quality is a lot better then the kenmore and it should last a lot longer my friend has had his siver c for 9 years and it 's still going strong ! delivery was quick ! i ordered on a monday and it was delivered on friday setup was easy grill heats up very hot and quickly even though it 's only 36000 btu's i just ordered the rotisserie attachment for it and i 'll provide feedback as soon as i try it out this grill is now discontinued from weber as they have new models out now i got this on sale at amazon for 466 00 on sale i would n't pay anymore than that look for a closeout deal on here or elsewhere i'm sure they will start popping up	24

0	these work great initially i bought six of them of the six four broke one stopped altogether one stopped oscillating and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed i bought them in may and they broke after 2 3 and 4 months respectively they are expensive fans and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all i have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty \( this is 1 year \) and higher quality components	24
0	i have one other weather station from la crosse that seems to work ok but this thing is a paperweight as far as i am concerned it shows that it is raining out when the sun is out ! it constantly losses contact with the remote sensor and the temp and humidity seems to always be off i have attempted to contact la crosse but as other reviewers have said that is a lost cause they never answer any emails regarding product help or issues and no one seems to answer their phone either maybe i have a lemon but i feel for what they charge for their products la crosse should be more responsive to their customers	24
1	i bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before i tried to set it up i will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating we 'll apparently they were not i tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together so at that point i gave up and waited for my husbands help the two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had \( after we washed off all the soap b c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible \) and once we had the center base up i pushed it and it fell completely apart we got it back together but there was no way i felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it so in desperation i called the toysrus store where i got it and spoke w the store manager she assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that i should bring it back i wasnt thrilled about that b c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place but what choice did i have i asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b c i was n't about to go through this again when i arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy exactly what i had wanted it to be when i had purchased it unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10 15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett just like some of the other reviewers had said so the morale of the story is if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back but once its together properly its great now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world !	24
1	breaking away is a true rarity a feel good movie that does n't that is n't silly yes there are plenty of laughs in it but they 're the result of great acting and writing not the cheap crude one liners that litter so many of today 's so called comedies and while the movie will tug at your heartstrings it never spills over into gooey sentimentality or empty pathos but i also feel sort of sad whenever i watch breaking away the small town downtown where the guys hang out is just a fading memory for most americans and are there any old swimming holes anymore like the quarry that the characters visit \? or have they all been paved over for luxury mcmansion subdivisions \? shut me up ! just watch breaking away and enjoy it	24
0	i have a pretty decent computer \( athlon64 3000 radeon x550 \) but this game does not work at all even after i download and install the patch from aspyr \( though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box \) spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the cpu until i kill the process aspyr support is unable to help that said despite other reviews here this game does not install starforce but maybe that 's why my version wo n't work	24

0	i was really looking forward to this game and i was prepared to overlook one or two things every game has it 's own personality right \? i found instead this game actually does n't have much of one at all i did n't mind the graphics not cutting edge sure but not that bad either a little muddy but a change from cartoony it was hard to enjoy closeup views however when so many buildings lost their roof on zoom no way to toggle that feature the camera angles were frustrating and it was very difficult to pick anything out with the mouse accurately not that there was much time to look at the scenery immigrants came and came and came whether there were houses and jobs available or not as long as city happiness was high enough which meant that everyone was happy which they were not because they had no houses or jobs to keep city happiness up was the only way to ensure a somewhat stable economy forget planning forget balancing resources with workshops and markets it was n't clear what the balance was in any case it would take trial and error and you did n't have the time for you were building worshops like mad trying to guess at how many citizens would be employed by each and researching for temporary bumps to keep your city from being deserted in droves the best income boosts were not through sale of goods or trade it was through research maximising the tax base with the development of currency and so on you hit those early on and reached a certain population level you made money the rest of the time you spent trying to keep people from leaving there was no stability in reaching any level it quickly became a game of keep up there was no way to control immigration or set the pace of development and for all the decorative options more than the similar games out you really did n't care in the end what your city looked like because it just cost time money too but that was really not the relevant issue unless people were unhappy then you could stick a few things quickly somewhere you just ca n't enjoy a leisurely pace of planning building and finishing it off with a nudge here and there and watching it run you have to be constantly involved in the process staying ahead of the curve you do n't have to worry about maintenance such as city fires or engineers but the cities cannot not be made self sufficient or self sustaining with this inherent instability built into the gameplay five or ten minutes away from the screen will bring most cities if not all to a screeching halt while i enjoyed the research options and the ability to move homes i thought was a great innovation not having the ability to control the flow of immigrants to the city and pegging success to city happiness makes this game a poor economic simulation and the gameplay ultimately very shallow and unsatisfying	24

1	for over three years i 've been studying buddhism and zen during that time i 've ordered many books within the different buddhist schools there are many fine authors out there that explain the tenets and fine workings of buddhism as well as zen i believe a solid background in buddhism background is essential in understanding buddha 's message to mankind however the true nuts and bolts of buddhism practice can be found most directly in zen it is one thing to know something about a religion or way of life yet it is another to be able to apply it ezra bayda has most succinctly given the best instruction of how to apply zen to one 's life where we need it the most during those moments when we are gripped with our core pain core pain is comprised of our anger traumas sadness feelings of inferiority etc it is this core pain that can make our life a living hell ezra examines these emotions and teaches us how we can mindfully learn to transform them in a way that truly works instead of denying them or trying to escape them we learn that they are part of our path in life and while it takes courage to be present with these emotions we learn that they are but old programs and often ancient belief systems that take us away from the genuine life we all deserve at least one reader has referred to this as being like a self help book yet anytime we look for truth whether it be in religion or psychology are n't we looking for something to help us ezra offers us the tools to achieve transformation in our life when i ordered this book i had hoped it would teach me how to truly apply zen teachings to my life what i did n't realize is that the information this book contains would exceed anything i have read in any religious book psychology book or college text another reviewer said where 's the zen in reference to the contents of this book the zen is there on every page while ezra does n't use the esoteric style of writing common in zen buddhist teaching his simple clearcut way of communication exemplifies the simpleness that zen is truly about ezra 's other two books at home in the muddy water and saying yes to life are excellent as well and deepen your understanding of living mindfully and in the moment a helpful hint read his three books in chronological order with this book first personally i think that reading them in order adds to a person 's understanding and that each book acts like a foundation for the next ezra bayda i have not had the honor of meeting you personally yet i thank you most sincerely for the gift of your writings i bow to you for you are a master ! there are many of us i'm sure that are looking forward to your future works two other excellent zen books that teach mindful living and dealing with difficult emotions are beginning mindfulness learning the way of awareness by andrew weiss and at hell 's gate a soldier 's journey by claude anshin thomas also the writing 's of thich nhat hanh a great man who highly influenced both of these authors teaches the art of mindful living in a very understandable manner good luck to you on the path	24
1	jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism \( highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled conveniences and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain \) it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long and several scenes \( notably the garden party \) would have benefited by judicious paring still the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy	24

0	we purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the disney princesses even though we purchased it as a play bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child we immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be it 's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably would n't last long anyway i recommend you look else where for your child 's princess dreams	24

0	this is the first time i have ever reviewed a product and i do it so that no one else will waste their money on this it adds virtually nothing to xp too bad they did n't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition that would have been worth the money but old bill who does n't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new pc to get that product the themes are nice but far too few for the price the games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things the dj is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff too bad could have been something but in its present form not worth the money	24

1	i love my brinkman 's smoker but i did some modifications to get it in its present state the offset firebox arrangement using plain old charcoal will cost you a fortune ! when i first got this as a christmas present i found this out quick ! i went thru a whole 20 pound bag of kingsford too costly ! so what i did was to buy a propane tank and a propane burner i ran the burner 's metal intake connector out the brinkman 's air intake vent perfect fit ! the vent also held up one end of the propane burner then i placed a regular brick inside the firebox to support the other side of the propane burner i now have all the heat i want cheaply and also i now have pretty good temperature control ! i also agree with another poster that the optional temperature gauge placed in the brinkman 's cutout is a waste of money and would be inaccurate i did it and regret buying that thing however do get a remote smoker temperature unit that gives you two separate temperature probes and readings this way you can monitor both meat and internal smoker temps without opening the huge smoking chamber lid which would waste all your heat and smoke ! and speaking of smoke it drove me crazy figuring out how to make a sustained source of smoke that would n't snuff out the propane burner in the process ! here is what i did to solve this new problem take off that hobbit external smoke stack then take off the flimsy end cap that holds the swivel lid of the exhaust vent with a drill carefully make an 1 8 inch hole thru the welded on rod the end cap was attached to replace the lid now take a tie wire or maybe a cotter pin and put that into the hole you just made so that the swivel lid wo n't fall off as you invert it invert it \? \? \? yes invert it see you will be stuffing hickory wood blocks into this inverted pipe the part with the swivel lid will be placed directly onto the propane burner the end of the smoke stack should be positioned into the smoking chamber this way as smoke is produced the smoke will go directly into the chamber not the fire box which if it did would snuff out the propane burner ! and speaking of hickory smoke do n't buy chips ! it is too costly ! buy instead hickory wood blocks i buy mines from home depot in large bags for super cheap ! i use my small axe to carefully size the hickory blocks so that it fits snuggly into the inverted smoke stack works like magic oh one more thing place another hickory wood block you carefully sized into the now stubby smoking chamber 's exhaust pipe where the smoke stack used to attach to the wood block will block just enough so that most of the smoke stays inside the chamber and the wood block will allow just enough air flow so that the offset firebox 's propane burner will get its air there you have it the perfect smoker that is cheap to operate and effective at generating smoke ! and do n't forget to place a metal pot ontop of the propane burner that is full of water you need this boiling to create the needed steam for your smoker 's performance	24

0	having had norton products installed for years including antivirus internet security and systemworks i decided to replace the installed products with norton 360 and a non norton password manager obviously it is critical to first remove all norton programs before installing norton 360 the installation process proceeded relatively smoothly my computing environment includes a 1 6ghz processor 1 000mb of memory and 6gb of available disk the background scans and liveupdate have played havoc with my other applications by periodically locking up the entire cpu at 100 cpu utilization one application that streams radio broadcasts now stops i immediately disabled the automatic updates and scheduled backups however the cpu occasionally still locks additionally there is no way to transfer security settings from previous norton products to norton 360 thereby making the installation process very labor intensive if you now have separate norton security products and are satisfied with them save your money and renew the norton subscriptions	24
0	i developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill never having acne before this was devistating i watched all the infomercials and decided to go with murad 's acne complex kit expecting the glowing perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks i purchased the starter kit and i liked the smell of the products but after a month and a half i was still experiencing bad breakouts i even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface ! i continued to use the second shipment of murad because everything i read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks i spent 3 months and over 60 on this stuff without results silly me i was going to order more but i started reading reviews for my only alternative proactiv now that stuff is n't any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned acne free in their review and i figured that it was worth a try i found it at my local walreens for 19 let me tell you i used acne free for 2 two days and saw results that i had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff i ca n't say enough about it i'm thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product goes to show do n't buy from t v	24
0	i'm currently in the process of adopting my son and i bought this to take to guatemala with me when i visited it never worked it did n't matter how much water i put in the chamber it would never cycle on more more than 30 seconds i then had to wait approximately 5 minutes for it to cool back down before using it for another 30 second cycle i ended up filling the ice bucket with hot water and letting the bottle sit in that to warm up needless to say it 's been sent back i think i 'll just use the microwave when the baby gets home it 's got to be easier and quicker than this thing	24

0	i will not lash out against anyone and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious ostentatious egotism that said let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth 's solutions extremely difficult to accept first off it does n't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus 's morals in general terms if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus 's codices the key point here is that jesus 's older analects were deluded enough his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale jesus 's peuplade appears to be growing in number i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations circumvent any further litigation and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death all by trumping up a phony emergency his desire to control your bank account your employment your personal safety and your mind is the chief sign that he 's a slaphappy caitiff \( the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo treatment to cure my problem \) perhaps i'm reading too much into jesus 's ravings but they do n't seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests jesus 's pr cis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent noxious feudalism that 's pretty transparent what 's not so transparent is the answer to the following question does jesus 's oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities \? a clue might be that every time he tries jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought but for imagination as well jesus 's eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing \( remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil \? \) jesus of nathareth has an agenda a political social and cultural agenda and that 's all i have to say	24

0	just listening to the samples of this new remix of gold 35th anniversary edition the carpenters i found it to be in my opinion sadly remixed very badly certainly not a tribute to the excellent talent of karen carpenter and richard as well i wonder what richard was thinking when he remixed these songs \? as another review noticed and i agree with is the bass on some is so loud it almost drowns out the pure excellence of karen 's deep resounding truly perfect voice this is not a cd you want to get if you really want to appreciate the true pure sound of the carpenters the older cds \( if still in production or if you can find them used \) carpenters classics 25th anniversary a 2 cd disc 98 04 minute collection remastered digitally is a much better pick especially for those who remember the carpenters when karen was still alive and the original arrangements were nothing to mess with the other cd 's worth finding of the carpendters especially if you like the talent of karen 's deep resounding perfect voice would be the cd voice of the heart this is a hautingly beautiful collection of love songs by karen who lets each song touch your heart and soul making you feel as if you were right there as she sings each song the other one i would highly recommend if christmas is your holiday would be carpenters christmas portrait special edition digital version celebrating 70 continuious minutes of the seasons best with karen and richard there are 34 carpenters songs as timeless as their sound and 11 performances heard on this holiday cd for the first time these cds are all the songs you fell in love with the first time you heard karen sing these are the arrangements so beautifully done with her and richard this new remix maybe ok if you have not been familiar with how wonderful the original songs the carpenter 's recorded and later remastered not remixed sounded for this reason i give this 35th anniversary remix a 2 star rating these older cds are how the carpenders really won over their fans took the music industry by storm and gave a generation of music lovers reason to love the carpenders music and the sound they gave each song talent that can still win over anyone who truly appreciates the timeless talents only the carpenters could deliver as i more or less said in my title for this review and taken from an old saying if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ! or in this case do n't remix it !	24
0	1 2when it was released in 1967 guess who 's coming to dinner was acclaimed as a breakthrough film for its lighthearted yet serious depiction of an interracial romance in the years since society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so called mixed marriages that any remake is bound to feel at least to some extent superfluous and anachronistic and that is exactly the case with guess who a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the stanley kramer original the screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in law rather than the other way around bernie mac assumes the spencer tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a caucasian boyfriend \( ashton kutcher as a white sidney poitier \) home to meet the family on the distaff side we have judith scott taking over for katherine hepburn as the understanding mother and zoe saldana replacing katherine houghton as the freethinking daughter since interracial marriage is no longer the hot button issue it once was the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non race related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama thus we have kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may in fact be the target of a securities and exchange commission probe indeed with kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father in law guess who feels more like a remake of meet the parents than of guess who 's coming to dinner the real problem with guess who is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that would n't pass muster even on a third rate sitcom for every scene that is incisive and daring i e kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table there is another that is pure hollywood hokum \( mac and kutcher sleeping in the same bed together mac and kutcher having a go cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo etc \) all of the performers are fine especially mac and kutcher in the lead roles however they just haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here guess who might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine hard edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality still it 's been 38 years since guess who 's coming to dinner first shocked the nation with its in your face defiance of miscegenation laws and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition which is why in the year 2005 brokeback mountain was a breakthrough film and guess who was not	24

0	when this toy is turned on it seriously sounds like an air raid siren is going off i ca n't use my usual trick of putting tape over the speaker because you need to be able to hear the instructions to play the games also the counting shape game is confusing there is a row of shapes with numbers on them and the game asks the child to for example find 3 rectangles it 's trying to get the child to press the rectangle shape three times but the rectangle shape is marked with the number 8 there 's a circle marked with the number 3 the only reason i'm not giving this one star is because my son enjoys playing the repeat the tone and count the villians games i'm not sure how much longer the adults in the house can handle the siren noise though i may try to hide this and get him a leapfrog toy instead	24

1	what a great magazine its like receiving a small book of knitting patterns every few months most of which are totally wearable i really feel this mag rides the line between fashionable and practical i have gotten 4 issues so far and have knit 1 or more items out of each issue the directions could use a bit more description sometimes the designers think you can read their minds but nothing a trip to the geniuses at the yarn store wo n't fix there are also interesting articles about things like merino sheep something you would n't think was interesting but then you start reading it and ca n't put it down love the book reviews and ads i ordered a dvd from one of the ads and am so so happy with it i also bought a book after reading the review and have been enjoying it keep in mind that these are fashion models and really try to picture your body in the item before you go spending a lot of time on a fitted tank that will make you look massive i got this as a gift and will definitely be renewing my subscription when it ends	24

1	this book is not about the grand strategy of war nor is it specifically about the heroic actions of its author audie murphy who was of course america 's most decorated soldier of world war ii on the contrary the book is about the war as seen up close and personal by those who actually fought it in the foxholes on the roads and in the forests and many times on the open battle fields of north africa and europe it is a remarkable book which puts the reader right in the middle of the action right there with the bone weary dog faces wallowing in the mud at the bottom of their fox holes right there with them as they slog toward the battle lines with trucks passing them bearing the corpses of those who went before and if the reader listens carefully to their gallows humor he or she can hear them joke with one another as they try to calm their nerves and still their fears then he or she can hug the ground right beside them as they are shelled by mortars and artillery or raked by machine gun fire and watch as the soldier whom he or she has almost come to know is picked off by a concealed sniper or killed by a mortar blast in other words this book is about war and the men who fight it if i had to recommend one book by means of which a reader could fully understand what it is truly like to be a combat infantryman this would be the one	24
1	the cover of this book compares it to the kite runner so it caught my attention i honestly could not stop reading as yasmina khadra does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters he weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people 's humanity my only nit is the ending was a bit predictable that said it was still a very good ending that rings true spoiler if you wonder why she did n't come back consider that she would not forget the face of the man that bumped into her on the street which led to them being stopped which ultimately resulted in her husband 's death i honestly ca n't wait to read more by yasmina khadra	24

0	i found cat fancy magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners i'm also very unimpressed with their cat channel online board they advertise in cat fancy and cannot recommend it to others they seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it also cat fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine but if you go onto amazon you can get a renewal rate of almost half the cat fancy renewal price so i have come to the conclusion that between the cat fancy magazine their poor online cat channel board and the high renewal rate cat fancy charges they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members	24

0	it seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them and the flower kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds here we have yet another double helping of their ageless wisdom strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment though not as crass and offensive as stolt 's wall street voodoo or bodin 's i am this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness there are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release but not enough to justify its purchase stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that peace love never go out of fashion well neither does informed maturity and you wo n't find any of that in this group 's recent output just more utopian preaching and good vs evil typecasting their liner notes advocate sending money to greenpeace and amnesty international but i would counter that any american would be better investing their extra cash at st jude 's children 's hospital i'm going to sell my copy of paradox hotel and probably several more flower kings cds to do just that there are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would be hippies	24
0	i like most of ac dc 's music but i ca n't stand their latest album stiff upper lip stiff upper lip is the only ac dc album where you can play it all the way through and not even hear one good song stiff upper lip does n't even come close to being as good as back in black or highway to hell every song on it just bugs the heck out of me listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy ! the overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like highway to hell or back in black but those cds had variety they were semi original and they were actually pretty good this cd is just completely worthless i have heard some cra ppy cds in my lifetime but none of them were more pain to listen to than this the vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums the music is chunky repetitive dull and boring and most of the songs sound the same stiff upper lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band the music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks this cd is just unbelievaby terrible it is a disgrace to this band 's legacy and the band members should be embarrased by it oh well i guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract so i guess they do n't care about how awful it is anyway all i can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible it is a total piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to go buy a good ac dc cd like let there be rock high voltage powerage highway to hell or back in black stiff upper lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise it 's so awful i 'd rather listen to the new nickelback cd than this !	24

1	as a very frugal spender i had observed this new design of coffee making in the stores and thought the process made sense so i was ecstatic to receive an email of a promotion one day i drove many miles to save some bucks and continue to be pleased beyond belief with every new kind of coffee we try we did n't like the competing cheaper brands but we find douwe egbert 's senseo brands consistently delicious the flavors are subtle enough that we do n't feel we 're drinking a cup of chemicals if you like strong coffee then stick to the 4 oz per pod suggestion if that seems strong or bitter we find we can get 2 or 3 more ounces from the pod and be very pleased for the first time in my 30 year marriage my husband does n't make a point of commenting on the delicious coffee everytime we eat out finally we have predictable great coffee at home being able to serve guests their choice of tea flavors or caffeine and have everyone enjoy the first cup out is a wonderful benefit	24

1	i stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago having nothing better to do i watched it my first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens i was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot you do n't have to be stoned or even a stoner to enjoy this movie one reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film like your actualy there scrapping through life with the characters i guess i can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie not enough bells and whisels but if your up for something differnt give it a try by the way the movie was based on a book of the same name also very good and differnt	24
1	i received the soku lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled ! the box itself is decorative and i re used it as a pencil holder on my desk the scent is very aromatic and long lasting i had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house i was very pleased	24

1	if you 're one of those people like me who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time now is the time to upgrade you wo n't be disappointed just ask the editors of both pc magazine and c net which awarded this version their editor 's choice award once again adobe has listened to its loyal customer base the proof is in the new version of illustrator many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we did n't even think of i was happy to find out that even with the new features adobe has not altered illustrator 's previous palettes or keyboard commands there 's nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version no fear here ! first of all i want to say that i am really impressed with the live trace and live paint features especially when used together we all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer we end up drawing it out on a napkin paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment normally once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using illustrator which takes both time and effort not any more take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in once the image has been scanned then the fun begins once the image has been scanned in and brought into illustrator cs2 use the live trace feature to actually trace your drawing this feature actually turns to drawing into a live trace object for easy manipulation after applying some blurring as needed your traced image is cleared up then convert your live trace object into a live paint object using the new control palette i like the live paint tool also because it reminds me of working in photoshop once you 've converted to the live paint object you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking live paint also has a feature called gap detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line this is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later when the object outlines are finalized use the live paint feature to easily fill any region with color voila ! you are done go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes a concern of many of us for years was the fact that while illustrator keep getting better and newer features it also mean more and more palettes sometimes it became a little unmanageable however the pros at adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution the control palette this new palette sits at the top of the screen first it acts as a an object inspector providing information secondly \( and more importantly \) the control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus brush shape opacity and style no longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features if you are fans of adobe 's other creative suite 2 software you will be pleased to learn that the control palette is apart of their new makeover too here are some more new additions and changes to illustrator like photoshop illustrator cs2 now supports custom workspaces you can display only the palettes you need at any time you are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates adobe has improved the swatch and color integration now working with the other creative suite 2 programs is seamless isolation mode is a feature that allows you to double click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the layers palette cs2 now supports all of the latest wacom tablets it now provides brush support for the new wacom 6d art pen and adds a new dimension illustrator 's calligraphic and scatter brushes adobe bridge integration is now a part of illustrator cs2 bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow macromedia flash exports are now available you can export both text and objects as flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects you can now open photoshop files with layer comps within illustrator this new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time just as you do in photoshop custom stroke placement is a new addition to illustrator you can now place strokes on the outside inside or center of a path underline and strikethrough are two of over 170 new type enhancements these are a few of the new features ! the 169 upgrade cost is well worth the money just for the live trace and live paint features alone however you get so much more in the new illustrator cs2 upgrade now and be completely satisfied if you have n't purchased a vector graphics program get illustrator especially if you are already an owner of a version of photoshop this new version of illustrator even looks more like the familiar photoshop layout loren elksgroup manager d mag org	24

1	i bought the african american 2005 holiday barbie for my little girl i agree with her statement that she 's too pretty to play with ! ! mattel did an amazing job this year the face on this doll is exquisite miss 2005 is absolutely proportionate in classic barbie terms the gown 's colors definitely put you in a festive spirit in fact the ball gown as a whole is supernaturally beautiful picking bob mackie as this year 's designer was nothing short of genius when i saw that mackie was the holiday designer i knew that mattel had finally gotten it right !	24
0	i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost you truly get what you pay for and this thing is n't worth a plug nickel i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was 300mm \( 480mm on a digital rebel xt \) incredibly soft even stopped down i would never want to make an enlargement from it stay away do n't believe the fools who are novices you will be disappointed with this lens you 're much better off to buy the older used 100 300mm 5 6 \( the l version costs more too \) but both are so much better than this junker you 're even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo 's with this lens handheld having switched from nikon when switching to digital i almost judged canon from this one lens which i'm glad i did n't do n't waste your money or learn the hard way like i did this lens also had terrible purple fringing almost as bad as the kit 18 55mm after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses canon 10 22mmcanon 28 105mm \( 3 5 version \) canon 100 300mm \( 5 6 non l version \) i will sell for the l version when i can afford it the kit 18 55mm makes usable shots but when i could afford it i sold it too you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older 100 300mm than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible 75 300mm lens	24

1	amazon shipped the watch very quickly it arrived two days before they said it would and i was very happy with the weight and styling of the watch a good purchase i think to myself the only piece of styling i was not happy about was the large magnifier above the date on the watch which is not visible on the amazon photos when i pulled out the crown to set the time and date i got that sinking feeling that something wasnt right and that feeling was followed by the whole crown comming out of the watch i was able to put it back in and set the time but setting the date was not possible i used amazons online return procedure filling out an html entry field box about the problem and printed out postage and a barcode to put in the box i took it to the post office and the shipping was free although the post office was not able to insure the shipment which kind of worried me that was 4 days ago and i still havent heard anything from amazon about the return although they did say expect 5 9 days to process returns i hope it all goes well and i get a replacent watch i did read about this same problem on other amazon reviews for similar watches by invicta so it is worth looking into before purchasing	24

1	these sheets were the color size and quality described however if you tend to roll over instead of picking yourself up when you turn over while sleeping your sheets will very quickly begin to ball yes those tiny little balls you get on the clothes you wear within about 6 8 weeks the sheets have balls on the areas were the most friction happens they are otherwise great sheets but they do n't act like egyptian cotton they are thick warm but lack the softness of egyptian cotton and feel almost heavy like twill \( soft twill mind you \) but they do n't feel anything like my previous sets of egyptian cotton sheets i paid more money for pay for the real thing if you want soft non balling sheets	24

1	like many other long term hobby digital photo fans i have used paint shop pro for more than 10 years from version 4 it has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on as digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of paint shop pro became more of a frustration and i tried everything else at last corel paint shop pro photo feels like it was written for photo editing it is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go and more i'm sad to see paint shop album almost redundant but it is great to have the organiser on tap it runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider	24

1	as an er trauma nurse i have seen and been involved in many many cardiac arrests here is some information that you need to know 1 \) you must still perform adequate cpr if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain ! 2 \) even with trained personnel cpr a defibrillator and advanced cardiac life support \( medications \) the survival rate is very very low i am not telling you this to discourage purchasing this aed it is a wonderful unit i have been trained on it and had to use it once i am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over 1000 on a defibrillator \( especially for a private home \) then a good idea would be to spend another 50 and take a basic cpr class i hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it ! !	24

1	i purchased this item when my daughter was one year old and it was amazing ! my daughter was always a good sleeper but when she began teething at around 9 10 months old she began refusing to stay in her crib each night i was out of ideas and my husband and i had tried just about every method we read about without success finally i found the tomy star bright light and it was like a miracle worker ! the first night i used it my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by staring at the ceiling each night her sleeping became better and better now we only run it once for 10 minutes and she falls asleep it is a much better approach then allowing your child to cry it out she actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks forward to watching the light show before she falls asleep	24

0	well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work i 've decided to write my own review i believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra hip i just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks nothing that has n't been told a thousand times over when i first hearsd sugar ray back in 97 i thought their sound was revolutionary i bought floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album then the third fourth and fifth albums came out the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that were n't radio friendly such as glory personal space invader and burning dog and with the release of their fourth album i bought it as well hoping that they would get back on formula yes as you might of guessed i was delusional their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted now with the release of their fifth album they had already lost me as a fan so therefore i give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1 5 stars for lack of originality	24

1	what do an environmentalist a firefighter and a chain store executive have in common \? quite a bit according to this joy of a film david o russell and jeff baena have written a highly intelligent comedy about a man who 's trying to make sense of his life that man is albert markovski \( jason schwartzman \) a founder of a group called the open space coalition who are trying to preserve forest and marsh area 's where big business want to tear it down in his latest attempt he 's joined forces with a chain store known as huckabees whose exec on the way up brad stand \( jude law \) seems to have a hidden agenda all this aside albert is troubled by a very tall african teenager that has crossed his path on three occasions and he is convinced this coincidence has substantial meaning in his life so he seeks out the help of vivian bernard jaffe \( tomlin and hoffman \) two existential detectives hiring them to follow his every move to decipher how his life makes sense vivian and bernard are also helping tommy \( mark whalberg \) a firefighter with strong views on humanity 's role in destroying the environment when brad finds out about albert 's association with these detectives he sees this as a way to get at albert to diminish his credibility with open spaces and thus gain control of the land and marsh huckabees wishes to tear down so he himself enlists the help of vivian and bernard in order to jab at albert 's sanity and this affects his girlfriend dawn \( naomi watts in another brilliant performance \) who begins to take these detectives advise seriously and this jeopardizes her relationship with brad and with huckabees since she is `the voice' and `the look' of the store when tommy and albert meet they decide to ditch vivian and bernard 's methods in pursuit of caterine vauben \( isabelle huppert \) a french existential detective who is in competition with the jaffes their methods while similar are actually at two separate extremes and throughout the film albert finds the balance he needs to make sense of it all this film is pure joy hilarious from start to finish thanks in part to the brilliant acting on the entire cast tomlin and law are standouts to me for their comedic timing is impeccable and whalberg is a complete surprise holding his own and proving he can act i have n't seen a film this smart in quite some time and another probably wo n't come along for too long either so lap this up like a puppy and enjoy every last gulp	24

1	with all clear coat finishes on modern automobiles the finish may look pretty good even when then outer layer is beginning to deteriorate so waxing is still important i recommend a fresh application of polish twice per year for maximum protection i have been following cosumers reports recommedations three years ago their recommendation was nufinish liquid this year cr recommneds black magic liquid automobile polish the liquids are easy to apply and seem to last at least as long as the paste waxes in my opinion the black magic is at least as good as the rest i like the cherry scent	24

0	seriously i am an expert and this movie sucks but imagine for a moment yes stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices a movie whose premise is truly profound strikingly engaging and culturally challenging that art is only such relative to those individuals those `experts' whose tastes likes and dislikes decide it so given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical a matter of pure subjective opinion why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all \? besides this interesting question which is put forth explicitly without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry and in about 60 seconds the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration avoid at all costs	24

0	i bought it new after using this shaver a couple of times in a shower it stopped working i took it to a braun affiliated repair shop braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior including the electronics they said this is not a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me i checked the manual before i used the shaver in the shower it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower i have not opened the shaver i have not cleaned it in water thus based on my experience this shaver and braun are a scam as far as i am concerned	24
1	the shoe is very comfortable along the insole with lots of cushioning you can walk for hours without your feet feeling the stress however there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process i have n't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in i do appreciate the covered toe which i feel is a very big bonus for this shoe it 's not obtrusive and does n't ruin the look of the shoe at all but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged the ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility is n't impeded i live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking so the waterproof claim is reliable overall for the price i'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase	24
1	this series has just a tad too much blood for my taste it verges on horror here and there which bugs me i even like super violent action movies just fine but the brutally slaughtered recent corpse thing \( more 'personalized' violence than killing bad guys \) is not my style this is why i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars aside from that detail i find this show totally addictive the brothers make a 'buddy movie' effect and the whole supernatural framework creates a sort of non religious yet definitely spiritual effect \( the big mystery being why these guys never ever are seen praying in the show i have actually known people who had a lifestyle similar to what the show depicts and that is central \) not to mention the young men being so passionate powerful strong yet sensitive darkly troubled from the past sheer sexy it 's nearly intoxicating over the long run of many episodes \) anyway the show has an actual plot it 's well filmed and intelligently done and is well worth watching i recommend it	24
1	we were just at the baby store to choose carseats and the britax marathon carseat on display had a gogo babyz travelmate attached to it it was so easy to maneuver that my 7 year old daughter wheeled her 20 pound baby sister around the aisle for fun two large solid screw in knobs attach the travelmate to a backplate that secures the seat the whole combination looks very sturdy and relatively easy to use we bought both the marathon and travelmate we were looking for a better alternative to the sit 'n stroll this may be it i cannot compare the two options as i have never tried the sit 'n stroll only read the so so reviews	24
1	this is a very funny movie and i honestly laughed so hard i was crying had never even heard of any of the comedians except for jeff foxworthy and i had only heard some of his you might be a redneck jokes ron white is just plain down and out funny his timing is wonderful and you do n't get what you expect you do laugh a lot and you need to put down your beer before he starts talking lest you blow it out your nose ! bill engval is the funniest comedian in this line up if you do n't know bill 's work watch the movie you will become a fan his 'here 's your sign' stuff is funny but has gotten like foxworthy 's 'you might be a redneck ' however bill shines in that he can talk about anything at home and have you rolling on the floor i 've already heard almost all of the jokes in the movie ron white and larry the cable guy basically do the same jokes they did on the blue collar comedy tour cd that came out at the end of 2000 also almost all of bill engvalls jokes were on that cd or his new comedy cd that came out late last year \( cheap drunk an autobiography \) most of jeff foxworthys jokes are not on a cd but if you 've seen him live sometime during the last couple of years you 've heard almost all of them actually you can say that about all 4 guys however if you 've never heard of the 4 guys before or if you 've heard of them but never seen them live or heard any of their cd 's then definitely go see this movie the jokes are hysterical then you can go and pick up the comedy cd 's and see them live they have new jokes when you see them live these guys as a group and as individuals are not stupid you do n't get to where they are by being idiots only by portraying them they know what they are doing this video is about laughing about laughing really hard because they talk about things that have happened to us things we have felt life is sweet life is beautiful life can be ugly and hard and often life real life is hilarious and all those traits are n't isolate they mix and mingle and complicate	24
1	if you follow my reviews you know that i felt the version of jack the ripper with michael caine as inspector fred abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece not only was michael caine phenomenal in the role but that version offered convincing speculation to a mystery we do n't know and never will while i respect this version with johnny depp it is more horror oriented \( michael caine 's version was more historical \) onto the subject at hand some of you may know jack 's 5 victims \( mary anne nichols annie chapman elizabeth stride kathy eadows and mary jane kelly \) well they seem to have a close friendship and we also get the impression that they share some dangerous secret \( in the michael caine version the 5 victims knew each other but they were just associates \) well of course jack the ripper comes into play one scene is very well done in that while we do n't see his face we do see some disturbing pictures and we do see him cutting his steak and pouring blood red wine in comes depp \( inspector fred abberline \) it is interesting that while the older michael caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role johnny depp looks like his character is living on borrowed time and going to die anyday but maybe depp did n't want to just imitate caine one thing i had a problem with was that while caine had some trouble with his superiors depp 's trouble with his superiors is blown out of proportion \( without giving the story away his superiors must have known things that they did n't tell depp ! at least caine 's superiors carried some reason on their side ! \) you 'll probably notice that depp finds things out much quicker than caine did \( probably because caine 's version was 4 hours while depp 's is only 2 \) while caine was involved with an artist depp becomes involved with mary jane kelly gradually depp discovers things that put together an interesting puzzle like caine did in his version depp ironically gets close and almost friendly with the killer \( of course depp does not know he is talking to the killer \) well another problem here is that in the caine version we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and was even friendly with caine we never really understand here why the killer is friendly and even helpful to depp \( jack the ripper does not have the same mental illness he did in the caine version \) i will admit that the scenery is well done the elements of horror are there and depp did a good job of not just imitating michael caine and depp 's sergeant godley does offer some entertainment but if you saw the michael caine version you will undoubtedly miss the quite probable historical accuracy if on the other hand you do n't mind the fact that this version is more geared towards horror than history you 'll probably find it a respectable horror movie side note johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he 's going to die anyday well in reality fred abberline lived on for 40 more years after he stopped jack the ripper	24

0	hi i am writing this review in an attempt to help you save 10 this magazine is an embarrassment in every angle it is full of pictures of sexy boys men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear and pictures is all there is for you that think there will be something interesting to read read this there is nothing in this magazine to read ! ! ! the latest issue contains of 48 \( forty eight \) pages before you get to this issues contents the first article starts on page 126 \( ! \) and is about why a man would like to slice of his testicles ! totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text \( letters that forms sentences \) on about 40 of them besides this the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not well i can go on and on but i wo n't unfortunately i have a subscription and i am going to see if i can get it canceled i do n't even need my money back take your 10 and run them in the disposal it will be more fun to clean out the disposal than read this magazine	24
0	as much as i have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled chemistry between buckshot and 9th wonder the beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone they are working on a part two so i hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was	24

1	this 1960 effort by famed hammer productions of london england is one of their finest efforts and the greatest werewolf film ever made even by today 's standards the make up for the werewolf is eye opening and well worth the wait to see the movie is filled with underlying themes and for those who look it may be filled with a number of messages that are not readily apparent from the otherwise simple narrative color photography normally a strong suit in hammer films anyway is among their very best the performance by the young oliver reed as the werewolf is filled with energy and passion a highlight of director terence fisher 's accomplished career if you only can have one werewolf film this is the one	24

1	i heard that this grill was only 36000 btu and was not as hot as some other grills believe me this puppy is plenty hot if all you are going to do is cook food ! disregard this btu rating this btu rating is rubbish this grill will transfer so much heat to your food so fast that if you 're not used to cooking with a high quality grill you will turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol \( i used a custom cut 3 inch porter house to break in my new grill and to my surprise it was closer to well done than i prefer but still delicious ! \) everything is high quality it is much more solid than all the other grills i looked at and the grill is very even in terms of heating besides it is beautiful the side burner was not something i was really interested in but i just went for it i used it the first time this is the grill you need	24
1	this subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' cd because some chump has stolen it before you could this rock music magazine is superior to others on the market in my opinion because it has excellent production values i e luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions as a bonus the writing is superior and highly imaginative an expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched i like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band in addition this magazine covers us and worldwide bands that may not be as well known here in the usa as they are in uk often these are bands that we might want to know better the reviews section is always great and usually the magazine will highlight a mini section e g 'best r amp b albums from the 1970 's in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists this magazine will have you finding buying and liking albums by bands you 've never heard of and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price	24

1	i got my grill to go advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far the makers of the grill 2 go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill the open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models it is still easy to transport and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my tarheels play basketball a lot of fun i completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non stick cooking surface for the cooking area	24
0	unlike years past h r block \( founded by a guy named bloch \) decided to charge 16 for each e file federal or state only one version premium federal state e file includes a free federal e file and state e file but that version costs 70 so there 's no free lunch at all seriously 16 is a lot to pay for e filing there are websites that give you completely free e filing my favorite is taxact \( at taxactonline dot com \) with taxact you get the complete federal plus state package for 7 95 which includes e filing or you can use their standard package to prepare federal and e file for free with no income restriction ! i do n't work for any of these companies nor any tax related company nor any such entity i just do n't think it 's right for h r block to charge customers such a ridiculously high fee for e filing whereas people can e file for free elsewhere btw if you use taxcut to prepare your return you 'll have to use h r block 's e filing service if you want to e file you ca n't just take your file to another website and expect that website to do it for you i used taxact in the past and they are very dependable you can find reviews of taxact products in major magazines and on major websites good luck	24

0	bought this platinum game with much anticipation and it does n't work at all tried the download exe patch and does nothing and to top it off half the original game forum sites crash too no one has any idea how to fix this game and all you have to do is look at the dozen of patches out on first game if they had spent the time and money to build the game and test it right like blizzard does and companies like westwood was then they would release a finished game but decided to use everyone as gunea pigs to test the product so they could try to patch it to work do not buy anything from this company or its affiliates i think they are alkida implants trying to take over the western world if you want to play a game with style then wait until june and get titan 's quest which should be finally a diablo 3 too bad this company could n't find the capital to complete the game before release and would think anyone wanting to buy spellforce 2 should be warned upfront to make sure you wait for about 6 months after release and buy an additional hard drive so you can download the new patch fixes they will probably try to smoke screen you with as they count their money and send it to iran	24
1	ray sawyer \( rick cramer \) agnes bruckner \( eden \) laura ramsey \( rachel \) jonathan jackson \( eric \) and d j cotrana \( sean \) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie eric and eden are going through any typical teen romance going steady one minute broken up the next eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress one evening ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food known as the local nut case ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town later that same evening ray comes upon eric and eden on a lonely bridge swerving to miss eric 's jeep ray instead crashes into an on coming car the impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge the car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car after pulling her to safety ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about however both ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below to make matters worse the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes who immediately begin striking at ray all that can be heard are ray 's screams as the car sinks ray 's body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue but it does n't remain there for long it seems that the woman in the car was a voodoo priestess and the snakes were used to cleanse people by drawing the evil out of them now the evil venom is flowing through ray now begins a bloodbath of carnage as ray possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him begins to stalk unsuspecting victims one by one he exacts his revenge on eden 's friends until only eden remains who will win this final showdown ray or eden \? i 've always been a big fan of slasher type films and characters like freddy from the nightmare on elm street series as well as jason from friday the 13th ray sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly the motives are the same kill as many teenagers as possible and ray succeeds in this very well i thought the story involving voodoo was well conceived the special effects were good too i recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans although the movie is short \( only about 80 minutes \) there 's lots of slashing in a short amount of time if you enjoy a good slasher flick then do n't miss venom	24

0	the reviewer who called this a disney bait switch hit the nail right on the head ! i too remember seeing all these episodes on tv as a kid then later on disney channel and was awaiting these to be released on dvd as i have already purchased the davy crockett and tomorrowland sets and loved them both but imagine my overt disappointment when i read the actual details of this slapped together third rate offering ! i never cared for the elfego baca story i had been known to go to my room and voluntarily do my homework on sunday nights when these episodes played but i would have gladly paid the price for this set if it had included all of the swamp fox episodes ! above and beyond the fact that i am proud to have francis marion as a distant relative and that i hail from the same part of our great country as this hero of the revolutionary war who with his compatriots probably contributed as much as george washington thomas jefferson or any of the other founding fathers to win us our freedom i really loved this story just for itself ! not only have i decided not to waste my money on this incomplete set i have even gone as far as removing it from my wish list to save the funds of my family and friends as well ! i shall wait to see hopefully if disney will ever release the entire swamp fox story in a complete set for which i would gladly pay their somewhat exorbitant price	24
1	let me the say that the vocals on this cd may be painful at first yet you get over them very quickly except for a few spots even so they do not lower my score for the album and at times are quite catchy savage good riffs good solos catchy purely driven madness to start this insane album 93 100where my fortune lies the intro is absolutely nuts and the highlight of the song probably my least favorite after this yet the solos are still out of this world 87 100ninja what a great song ! the intro is one of the greatest things i have heard in my life and this song may actually have you humming along at points ninja ! very well laid out and the solos at the end are the best so far on the album brilliance 97 100concerto amazing once again and becker the 17 year old prodigy showcases himself throughout he proves he is the master of sweeping and arpreggios all over this album and this song is an insane instrumental that captures melodies like none other more notes played in 4 1 2 minutes than in george harrison 's entire career 98 100burn the ground fastest on the album solo wise in fact becker is so fast it is hard to believe that its human very melodic too except when there are vocals the song is kinda of disgusting 87 100desert island another amazing song very well laid out with great solos and great riffs the outro is the perfect intro to speed metal symphony the vocals are actually good on this song like ninja an entertaining song 97 100speed metal symphony nine minutes of shredding and arpreggios and all kinds of melodic madness that is beauty to any shredder 's ears everything about this song is good 97 100there is n't much to say about this album except becker and friedman show they are true masters of their instruments and are able to play in a melodic and listenable way i would recommend this over yngwie malmsteen who has not improved since his first album	24

0	any manufacturer that does n't fully label their product should not be trusted i do not see a list of ingredients here \( but most nail polishes do n't bother to do this anyway \) the problem i see is this this nail polish totes that it 's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it does n't contain the above ingredients but what does it contain instead \? if it wears well does n't peel give good color coverage it 's got to contain something in the offending ingredient 's place logically please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and add to basket ! phthalates for example are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s they are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin they are n't required to be labeled on the products lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects especially of the male reproductive system a nail polish may not contain phthalates \( and brag about it \) but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful does this contain phthalic anhydride a toxic chemical hardener \? how about fd c color such as yellow 5 \? it 's a petroleum based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety basically put no nail polish is safe during pregnancy on top of that while your at it you should review every lotion foundation product etc that you use if you 're concerned about things like this i think it 's great to be careful more power to you but be fully informed not partially companies prey on our worst fears and what is worse than harming our babies \? if this product is so great let 's see an ingredients list \( and all cosmetics should do the same while i'm sounding off on the subject ! \)	24

0	about three years ago maybe four i bought two lexar cfii cards one never worked the other worked but lost all data i wrote to lexar that i had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size i gave that to my girlfriend told her to only use it on pix she did n't care about losing i still have my card in a ziplock none of the file removal programs will get the images off i 've used all of them had their \( file removal \) tech help give up in this day age of just make the item i am upset but you take your chances do you want the only picture of your great grand mother lost because you used a lexar \? i would n't i use an actual sandisk card myself if they ever \( lexar \) made it right i may have written a better review but they have n't so that tells me that they do n't care how important are your pictures to you \? frederic	24
1	i will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot the 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl while she 's already fallen for someone else who is a complete jerk of course they end up together in the end however most movies are bought for the newness the originality and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf this movie captures attention through other avenues the characters are charming and everyone will relate to this movie and say 'hey that sounds like someone i know' ths soundtrack is fabulous and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by everclear that although short is very impressive my advice rent this if you like it the first time you see it then proceed to buy it because you always will if you 're not keen on it then do n't bother	24
0	i bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars i have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit the set i received did not have the extention straps included the harness was the same as all the other harnesses i could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back if you are buying these because of the extention straps you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars they were well made just not the same item as shown in the picture	24
1	love it ! the questions are great the party mode is great entertainment	24
1	i bought one of these when they first came out because we have very hard water and i hate shammying my car the soap does n't foam up like it would if you were bucket washing but it gets the car just as clean i sort of like that it does n't have a trigger device as it avoids accidentally spraying the vehicle when you do n't want to another plus is you do n't have to wash your car with a bucket full of dirty water the super fast jet spray setting is not that useful for me but i'm sure you off roaders would appreciate it i do n't agree with the reviewer who said it causes more water spots i do n't think they used it right if you wash your car pretty often this kit comes recommended	24
0	i have owned this vacuum for 2 years it was great at first now with a 3 level house it is heavy and awkward to lug around and the hose that serves as the main suction shaft gets clogged at the drop of a hat i have made mess after mess cleaning out clogs in the hose and now it drops dirt everywhere i move it the main filter wears out really fast and is expensive to replace if i had to do it all over again i 'd buy something else invest more in a better vacuum not this one	24

1	i use the medela pump but their thin bottles and simple caps do n't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh i love the heavy advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle	24
1	i'm on my 5th cap now i think silicone is great and lasts forever unlike rubber \( which can snag hair \) and latex \( which some people are allergic to \) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair has a glossy finish so it looks great and does n't lose elasticity i have a some advice if you want to try this product that i 've learned overt the years 1 always rinse and hang dry i 've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect it develops black spots i do n't know if it 's mold it does n't wash off and you 'll have to buy a new cap if you do n't like the spotted look 2 pull it on gently i 've ripped one when i was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it it 's not cloth so you have to be careful this goes for latex and rubber too 3 wet your hair first if your hair is dry when you put it on you will trap air under the cap and since it 's not a permeable material the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside 4 pick a fun color that 's it have a great swim	24
0	i helped my five year old assemble this and like most lego directions it went together well unfortunately it does n't stay together when he tries to play with it the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle not as easy to put back together once it 's come apart it 's proven a real disappointment	24

1	this clock is great for people who sleep on their backs if you happen to be lying on your stomach though you have to turn over to see the time on the ceiling or reach over to the clock and press the snooze button to briefly turn on the clock light i wish the clock itself had a lighted time display also we have 11 foot ceilings so the display is a little dim the snooze button is on top it is big and easy to press but the button to turn the alarm off is small and on the front below the display you have and grab the clock in an awkward way and hold the button down for a second to turn the alarm off the clock automatically set the time i was impressed with this as we live near the bottom of an apartment building surrounded by other tall buildings with no clear view of the sky	24

0	let me first say that once upon a time i liked larry the cable guy after reading this book i now think he is one step above slime to be fair some jokes are funny and some stories are enjoyable and amusing he is anti pc which is totally fine with me and even goes as far to pick on some appropriate targets like rosie o'donnell michael moore barney frank barbara streisand and that fat girl from the dixie chicks among others no problem there in my opinion that is the entirety of the positive things i can say about the book the rest is just babble often repeated over and over again that even larry lovers will find annoying a couple things that really bothered me the first is his constant and unrelenting picking on and making jokes at the expense of retards and down 's syndrome children he must use the term retard at least fifty times in the book this is appreciably different than making a joke about say michael moore moore made the decisions and taken the actions in his life to make him an apt target for jokes the down 's syndrome children did not my opinion of larry the cable guy dropped to zero or below after reading his attack on retards he also racially sterotypes in the book many of these jokes can be funny if taken in context and at least those people can respond the down 's syndrome kids ca n't larry i can only hope god \( in whom you so mightly believe in according to your book \) grants you a retard child to love and care for then i would like to read your next book i suspect you would gain some sorely needed wisdom very quickly the second theme in the book that came through loud and clear is that larry is a fraud in many senses he plays the good 'ol bubba he ai n't too bright and he ai n't ever changed since he left the farm his celebrity his word not mine has not gone to his head ok larry why then the better than thou tone throughout the book including speeches and lectures including serious topics such as abortion \? why do virtually every one of your stories and jokes involve putting someone else down \? why the unrelenting references to your celebrity \? the terms meet and greet and after party were used over and over and over as an example do you really think your fans have ever been to one of these events or even know what they are \? well you are wrong they are mentioned constantly to remind everyone how big of a star you have become that 's hollywood speak my country fart loving nose picking friend overall this book is a true disappointment and larry the cable guy is a true moron \( see does n't that sound better than retard \) my father always taught me there are two types of dumb people those who are dumb and know they are dumb and those who are dumb but are so dumb they do n't realize it the former category usually shuts up \( knowing they are dumb \) the latter category normally rambles on and on like some drunk in the gutter the first group is obviously smarter than the second larry the cable guy falls smack dab in the last group the fact that he has stumbled into some sense of success is fueling his rambling and babbles in this book make jokes larry and forget about your opinions on say abortion and the like unfortunately larry ca n't see the obvious like virtually every celebrity he cites and makes fun of in the book he has become exactly one of them a thin layer of good 'ol boy on top covering a core of venom and celebrity he plays the role pretty good until one gets under the sheets my suggestion do n't buy larry 's act and by all means do n't buy the book	24
0	where are the critiques \? the articles lack any critical substance whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype vibe will go along with the flow on top of that there are more ads now than ever before even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space	24

1	my previous phone was the motorola v60i with a monochrome screen with cingular so i am still getting used to all the differences in phone capabilities and have barely scratched the surface of what the i560 can do here 's a breakdown of the pros and cons so far \( after a week \) pros \( in order of coolness best first \) 1 nextel 's direct connect is amazingly fast and their network very clear 2 any call either directconnect or regular call can be made with the flip open or closed you can scroll through recent calls with the flip closed and call any of them 3 if you 're concerned about radio \( rf \) radiation and you should be even though nobody talks about it anymore this phone has the extendable antenna to get the transmission point further away from you \( and improves the transmission \) 4 the speakerphone is as loud as you need it to be even at dinning room table with the tv on and the sound patched through the stereo system \( very impressive \) there is virtually no lag in the switch between listening and speaking using the speakerphone \( full duplex \) you can also turn its volume down to a whisper if you want to 5 the phone is a little wider than some phones \( like the v60 \) but is very light yet the phone meets the tough military specs 6 rubberized grips on the phone make it easy to grip and dial with one hand and phone has a comfortable feel in my medium sized hand phone has slight hourglass shape \( wider at the bottom \) to fit nicely into the hand 7 charger charges the battery fast much faster than my v60 ever charged 8 phone has all the standard stuff i love and could n't live without voice dialing custom rings for calls from my contact list handsfree long recent calls list \( up to 20 \) ability to store number to contacts from recent calls \( without having to key the number just have to enter the name \) cons \( in order of annoyance worst first \) 1 the phone is almost completely made of plastic and i 've never thought plastic was as durable as metal while motorola makes truly awesome phones i worry there might be an over reliance on plastic to protect the insides of the phone 2 when the phone is in the holster the outside display is not visible forcing me to remove the phone from the holster to see who 's calling \( for those that do n't have a custom ring configured \) or to check the time very annoying as i'm used to using my phone as a watch 3 the icons on the outside display are small and those who are overdue for a new eye prescription might have trouble seeing and interpreting the icons the only two parts that are clear the battery \( important \) and date time 4 the flimsy port cover at bottom of the phone \( where you connect the charger etc \) make me think that someday i'm going to look down there and find it missing it 's easy enough to pop off but sometimes takes persuading to put back and have it cover the slot completely \( because it needs to be a snug fit to meet the military spec \) overall i really like the phone and highly recommend it to all	24
1	ok so i purchased this when my son was 4 months old i always thought it was pretty neat but figured he would n't sleep in it because it seems to glide too slow my son would n't sleep in anything but his swing i wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that i know he 'll sleep in so based on reviews i got this product at first i was a little disappointed because at night as soon as i laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else except his swing i just figured maybe i should have bought it a couple of months ago but what i did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know \? he sleeps in it more than his swing now ! i guess it was n't as cushiony as he wanted it to be i kind of noticed that too when i got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting so i do n't even use it aside from that it 's great the motor noise does n't seem to bother me or my son it is n't very loud to me but anyway he sleeps in it which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night i would say my money is well spent	24
0	bought this as an xmas present to myself to bring along family photos while on business travel i'm now on the 2nd unit \( exchanged directly w phillips \) and am still having the same issue with it not reliably working with external \( in my case sony memory sticks \) the internal memory is pitiful and unless you want to resize all the photos you put in it you are not going to be able to hold very many internally i 've yet to get the auto on off feature to work and while it is perhaps a pc friendly device it 's certainly not always mac friendly the controls are cumbersome to work with and the directions meager i wanted to be able to carry this in a backpack or carryon bag the fact that the support stand ca n't be folded tight against the unit makes it difficult to do this of course no mention of this in the product description also no mention that it only supports older memory sticks no support for the new ms produo sticks \( and no mention of that in the product descriptions either \) i thought i would get a quality product from phillips and this certainly looked like it had potential unfortunately it 's turned out to be a piece of junk one i 've been screwing around with for so long that it 's probably not returnable do n't waste your time and dollars	24

1	i have had three of these logitech wireless controllers now they have all broken nearly seven months to the day i buy them the problem is the same every time the left analog stick breaks my girlfriend got me my first one in december 2004 \( christmas \) it lasted until about july 2005 i exchanged it at the store and the new one lasted until maybe february 2006 i exchanged it again and now my third one has just bit the dust in september 2006 i am not really a heavy gamer i play madden and ncaa 2007 sparingly i am very disappointed with this repeat problem i also notice the x button sticking issue that others refer to here i tried putting a little graphite in there to make it not stick that seemed to work for a while you really ca n't beat the convenience of wireless and every other aspect of the controller is great except the durability	24

0	i started writing code for the web back when you could still order it as a text only service dos ruled the day and there were no ads plastered on every site this is the first product that takes huge steps backward in useability functionality and performance since the public birth of the web unlike the previous reviewers glowing account of as 4000 i am looking at new software because the service that this company provides and their complete lack of a proactive nature with regard to its useability have rankled me one too many times to wit 1 i am running a dual core 3 0 with 1 gb of memory and the 3d draw is slower that previous versions 2 tech support had the audacity to tell me that going to a drop down menu to rotate an item selected is faster than a right click of the mouse and a context menu that would allow me to do the same from that menu this is a step backward of at least 10 years previous versions had the right click menu which also had delete and other frequently used commands available really piss poor on their part to eliminate this feature alone 3 despite a fast newer machine once you select an item you have to wait before you can move it by selecting it a second time pitiful 4 wo n't import standard dxf files without saving them as one layer making a product that wo n't play nice with others is a bad thing i have other issues but just do n't want to spend any more time on this company or their products if i ran my business and failed to listen to my customers like punch i would be out of business bottom line no longer recommende	24

1	a great book for every usability practitioner not only did i find the content of this book very informative and very useful but in particular i liked the structure of the book and found it extremely usable each chapter contains context information at the beginning of the chapter an out line of the chapter summary notes on the side bar for quick review sample techniques and forms war stories estimation of resources required to complete each step etc this structure makes the book one of the most usable books i have ever used and therefore one of the most useful companion in designing the user interface	24
1	we \( my son and i \) purchased this gift set for my wife on valentines day although it was pricey relative to the target walmart selections the price was worth it we enjoyed the various unique flavors and the well decorated candies we would purchase this or similar set from godiva again it was worth the price and was well recieved	24

1	in the world of gaming there are specialized magazines for each system \( playstation magazine xbox mag etc \) most of which suck because they only report on \( duh \) games on their respective systems others like electronic gaming monthly encompass most systems but only do it half assed not really giving you anything to make you think highly of it then there 's gameinformer there are many things that set gameinformer apart from many other gaming magazines 1 \) they have completely unbiased opinions about the games they play if the game sucks they say so if it 's an awesome game they 'll tell you about it 2 \) matt helgeson \( senior gaming editor \) and the other editors actually inform you about the game 's most necessary attributes its esrb rating \( e to m \) their rating for the game \( from 1 to 10 \) and a brief introduction to the game 's faults and successes best of all however they include screenshots from the game and most screenshots rock these are just some of the reasons that gameinformer magazine is the absolute best gaming magazine on the market i have a subscription to this magazine and this magazine only and i hope my review has explained why	24
0	anyone who really loves a gourmet cup of coffee will hate this ! it 's burnt bitter weak battery acid ! and as consequence those coffee lovers may begin to hate their new senseo but take heart ! many online coffee shops now offer decent to delectable coffees at prices that rival this cheap swill i do n't specifically want to endorse any one product or online retailer but do a google search for senseo compatible pods and you 'll find several on the first page also please note that while these may initially seem pricier most third party pods work with just one to make an 8 ounce cup instead of the two pods that senseo brand products demand you do the math and it works out to be a comparable costing cup of joe	24

0	unless you love the look of this pepper grinder i 'd suggest you look elsewhere when compared to a generic grinder this product produces inferior and very inconsistent grinds i 've gone so far as to grind peppercorns onto a white sheet of paper to look at them with this grinder you 'll always get a huge variation in the grind some of the pieces of the peppercorns will be large enough that it would give anyone pause to wonder whether foreign matter had somehow entered the dish the oval top is quite slippery and when you tighten down the top nut to reduce the grind to something that will prove acceptable you 'll have trouble turning it not recommended	24
0	i have used intuit products since 1992 and was quite satisfied until 4 years ago when intuit began installing hidden software on users' computers in an attempt to stop piracy which caused numerous problems for us honest users who paid for the program secondly and even more significantly i began noticing an apparent shift in intuit 's philosophy toward it 's customers cut back on customer support and attempt to exploit them at every possible opportunity in order to make more money in short intuit disrespects their customers as a loyal paying customer i will not be disrespected or taken for granted their level of service and support has declined their products constantly pimp you to spend more money on intuit as you try to use their programs that is why i have sworn off intuit products when there is an alternative why reward someone who treats you badly \?	24

1	overall this is an outstanding grill i 've had it for a year and it 's been awesome it gets hot quickly it sears food well and it has all the bells and whistles the stainless steel grates are the primary reason to get the platinum and not the gold they are worth it unless you want to use plain cast iron and constantly oil them \( which also you 'd have to buy \) a couple of things to consider though 1 the design is kind a retarded for the smoker box using the smoker box and the rotisserie is chore you ca n't really open the smoker box because of the spit and the smoker box seems to want to rely on the grates \( which i remove to use the rotisserie \) so with the grates gone it will tip over easily 2 the grill has blown out a few times i think this is due to the fact that i do n't follow the instructions and turn the gas off when i'm done using it i just turn the grill off so the regulator has a protection mechanism that gets tripped and off the grill goes so i 've changed the way i use it and it has n't blown out since 3 there are these weird chains in the doors of the cabinet i have no idea what they are for and no one has been able to tell me so if i had it to do over again i 'd get the exact same grill it 's worth every single penny	24
0	i bought this item for my newborn thinking it would grow with him and be useful for at least the 1st year i was so wrong first as i feared the water fishbowl leaked the 1st time i filled it i returned it and the next one leaked as well then the mirror is one of those plastic mirrors that gives a distorted reflection which was of no value or interest to my son the cow that makes noise died after less than a month of light to no use finally the toy just did n't have that fun value that a 43 toy should have he hated it never attempted to crawl down it never played with the features save your money this toy is of poor quality and poor entertainment value there are tons of better products out there	24
1	this replaced a similar wrist cuff meter which i was not happy with the old meter would give very different readings on measurements made minutes apart this meter yields essentially the same numbers for second measurements out of curiosity i took it with me to my doctors office used his large cuff \( i have very large arms \) and compared the readings to his equipment total difference was about 3 a quite acceptable tolerance for my home measurement another reviewer was unhappy with the screen size and position on the bottom of the wrist if the unit is operated as shown in the instructions the screen size and position are perfect the unit is at heart level and is quite easy to read overall for home use and serious data collection and blood pressure monitoring i like this device	24

1	i'm pleased with the purchase i bought this camera just under two years ago when i was getting ready for a trip abroad i spent six months in england with five weeks travelling around europe with this camera in its case on my belt it 's very sturdy if nothing else between the trains planes hostels and general bustle i'm very pleased with how well it held up nothing on it broke i probably took at least 400 pictures during my trip if not more sure i 've had to swap out batteries on one or two occasions in the two years i 've had it but my general feeling is that the batteries are holding up quite well the zoom on this camera is very nice it 's one of the better zooms i 've seen on a simple camera of this type or at least it was back when i bought it it also has several features that older film cameras do not such as a timer that you can set before running to get in your own picture or settings to take portraits or night shots i know that this camera cannot compare to professional cameras i know that it does n't have all the frills of the new digital cameras and i am not trying to compare it to those i'm not a professional photographer so i do n't know how to use a camera with exchangable lenses and whatnot i do n't want a digital for personal and professional reasons for a traditional film camera this one is the best i 've ever used bottom line good quality photos a sturdy build excellent zoom lens useful and easy to use features and long battery life make this camera an excellent choice if you want a traditional film camera with a few perks	24

1	why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official \? because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust confidence and cons though the setting is a riverboat on the mississippi river just before the u s exploded into civil war its insights cross cultural boundaries this is not an easy book to read for several reasons first it is undoubtedly one of the first post modern novels which breaks from traditional narrative storytelling \( another example dostoevsky 's notes from the underground \) the confidence man is a collection of 45 conversations between various people on the riverboat beggars absurdly dressed frontiersmen sickly misers shysters patent medicine hucksters veterans \( of the mexican american war \) and the hero in the latter part of the book the cosmopolitan in typical melville fashion you also get asides directly to the reader in several cases as if melville felt the need to address issues of fiction outside the actual form of his novel the lack of structure action and conclusion make this a post modern type book but if you read each conversation as a separate story then it starts to make more sense for what ties the book together is not a story but a theme the nature of trust and confidence in a very sly way melville shows how a variety of cons are worked as the absolutely distrustful are slowly but surely convinced to do exactly what they vowed not to do buy the herbal patent medicine buy shares in a bogus stock venture or donate cash to a suspect charity in other chapters it seems like the con artist is either stopped in his tracks or is conned himself since the book is mostly conversations we are left to our own conclusions there is no authorial voice wrapping up each chapter with a neatly stated ending this elliptical structure conveys the ambiguous nature of trust we do n't want to be taken but confidence is also necessary for any business to be transacted to trust no one is to be entirely isolated melville also raises the question is it always a bad thing to be conned \? the sickly man seems to be improved by his purchase of the worthless herbal remedy and the donor conned out of his cash for the bogus charity also seems to feel better about himself and life the ornery frontiersman who 's been conned by lazy helpers softens up enough to trust the smooth talking employment agency owner is that a terrible thing to trust despite a history of being burned \? the ambuiguous nature of the bonds of trust is also explored we think the cosmopolitan is a con man but when he convinces a fellow passenger to part with a heavy sum he returns it just to prove a point is that a continuance of the con or is he actually trustworthy \? the book is also an exploration of a peculiarly american task sorting out who to trust in a multicultural non traditional society of highly diverse and highly mobile citizens in a traditional society things operate in rote ways young people follow in their parents' traditional roles money is made and lent according to unchanging standards and faith tradition guides transactions such as marriage and business along well worn pathways but in america none of this structure is available even in melville 's day america was a polyglot culture on the move you had to decide who to trust based on their dress manner and speech pitch the con of course works on precisely this necessity to rely on one 's senses and rationality rather than a traditional network of trusted people and methods so the con man dresses well and has a good story and an answer for every doubt the second reason why melville is hard to read is his long leisurely clause upon clause sentences but the book is also peppered with his sly humor which sneaks up on you well just like a good con	24

0	the self cleaning concept was the reason i bought this razor the razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad after owning the razor for two months i noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after i had just refilled the fluid after a closer inspection i found out that the fluid had leaked out all over and this fluid destroys everything it touches that is n't metal or plastic i thought maybe i had done something to cause the problem so i refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together it is now headed to the landfill the trimmer does not work well either	24
1	i love this product it is not super sweet like american sweets but just right it tastes like drinking green tea iced tea very refreshing with only one these japanese foods are high on flavor and it makes it so easy to eat just a few i am dieting so i like something i am not prone to over eat they do have hydrogenated oils so that is not good but i hear there is something about possibly getting it out another interesting ingredient was shea great for lotion and a nut butter that tastes good too i know now very good refreshing after meal taste one is even satisfiying and i mean one stick not one individual pack they come in small packs so they are easy to take on the go enjoy	24
1	how did he have the time to write such a picture to co direct it to act in it and after everything else to write its score \? noel coward 's energies always remarkable were redoubled during the second world war and it must have seemed like another excuse to show off his patriotism which he wore like a second skin despite his slummy upbringing in which we serve is still worth watching but it 's nowhere as appealing as either cavalcade or this happy breed and its focus on the life and death of a ship \( the hms torrin \) is strangely monomaniacal almost constructivist over and over you see unattributed bare arms hammmering away symbols of brute strength like something from a soviet film the ship goes up the ship goes down a new ship rises out of the water and in between coward tries his hardest to keep you interested in the lives of the men clinging to the lifeboat till our interest settles on three bernard miles as hardy with his striking long hatchet face and the deep voice that goes with it he should have played ichabod crane john mills as blake a tiny little pipsqueak who 's feisty in the standard mickey rooney jimmy cagney manner and noel coward himself as captain kinross tranquil with class privilege and in the background his glamorous marriage to the ineffable celia johnson \( so beautiful till she opens her mouth and those bits of teeth wobble around on her gums \) hitchcok 's lifeboat had the same concentration on a handful of downed and wet actors playing nautical but without coward 's complicated flashback structure coward stalwarts joyce carey and kay walsh show up as the love interests for miles and mills respectively carey in this movie and in brief encounter as well treated very unusually for the 1940s as a woman not in her first youth nor good looking in any way who 's given nevertheless a fullblooded and physical romantic interest she must have kissed the ground every time noel coward walked on it who else would have written such roles for her \? the movie is trying indeed when it goes serious and yet that 's half the fun of it seeing how often coward plays the race card we are an island race indeed i teared up of course i did during the blitz as the v 1 rockets drop bomb after bomb on london households leading to the death of several favorite characters and again when coward leads his naval boys into dunkirk and out of it again with a panoply of half nude british soldiers sipping tea or what looks like an enormous vat of kool aid outside of these scenes however the movie is marred by its agitprop and by david lean 's tiresomeness in showing everything at such a glacial pace ps the film was shot by ronald neame who later became a director himself and whose masterpiece the poseidon adventure sometimes seems like a shot by shot remake of the disaster sequences of in which we serve	24
0	ok i was hasty in this purchase at first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case about 14 shipping included then i got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera i ordered you see the dimensions listed under more details are for the outside of the case not the inside \( but it does n't say interior nor exterior just gives dimensions \) turns out not only do you have to click more details \( fine print \) you also have to click more technical details \( finer print \) wish i had now just wasted 9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case electrogalaxy will not refund shipping charges and they charge a 20 restocking fee so at most after i pay return shipping \( the case is only 4 \) i might get back 2 so yeah i was hasty but i was also robbed	24

1	i own several canon lens for my 20d and this is hands down the best i had a 28 135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews and i got many excellent photos with it this is distinctly better in all ways \( of course it costs a lot more \) recently went with the grandchildred to sea world and i got 100 good photos with several really outstanding ones it is light accurate and has is what more do you want \? you can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment if you have one lens this is the one	24
0	i was very excited to order this bike as i started to put it together i noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing ! i still attempted assembly and noticed that pre drilled holes were n't even close to being inline with the display ! the largest drawback and thing that upset me was that i did n't pay close enough attention when purchasing this it is does not allow for adjustment from seat to pedals i'm 6'3 tall and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable	24
0	liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it 'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i 've paid and never received it i have n't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i 've had to even say i 've been ripped off they may eventually send it but it 's not likely at this point it 's been a couple months now	24

1	as you might have guessed this is another cool game i have played in the arcade and it rocks ! time crisis 2 was wonderful but this is just outstanding i mean it has cooler graphics more usable weapons \( including grenades ! yowsers ! \) better sound effects and above all such terrific explosions shot hits music and gameplay that it makes this the best time crisis game i 've ever played in my whole entire \( beep \) ing life ! when i played this in the arcade i had tons and tons of fun why you think i put five stars for the fun rating \? to make this game even more enjoyable i used the fact i am a lover of animals and good people most especially lions tigers jaguars and sexy women of all sorts i imagined that those kinds of innocents mentioned were being threatened that the enemy in the game was the poacher slime threatening them \( as you know i not only love big cats all cool animals and decent human beings i also hate hate hate poachers ! \) and that i was the hero along with a sidekick who meant to save the women and the three large cat races needless to say every time i killed an enemy with bullet or grenade i let loose the words go to hell poacher scumbags ! which of course made the game all the more enjoyable as did saving lives which i imagined as either a big cat species or a beautiful woman anyway whether you imagine this or not this game is the best coolest most fun time crisis ever made and if you like shooting games or video games in general for that matter you must either play this in the arcade \( like me \) or if you got a ps2 buy it and enjoy ! i 'd say it rivals the masterpiece that is silent scope it 's so perfect	24
0	we bought this for our teenage son the handling of the shipping was prompt that is the only good thing i can say about the coat i will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality almost felt like the item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school ! i am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat if it was not so cold i would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing ! the item pills making it look really shabby no reports of seams ripped buttons lost or holes in the pocket however he may be worried that if he tells me about those things i will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money it was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself so imagine his disappointment ! i expected much more of the coat than i got and i am looking for a replacement	24

0	i had reviewed the first edition of b'day and i personally called it business day because beyonc could not offer what we could expect from her especially after the highly acclaimed dangerously in love actually in my opinion if ne yo had not inserted irreplaceable in this project it could have been a bust i agree d j vu and beautiful liar were hits but i give the credit to the casting rather than the script had these songs been given to india arie god knows what was gonna happen ! how can she accept to put out such a poor album \? some said beyonc views releasing albums in quick succession as a means of ejecting herself from her contractual obligations to sony columbia and team up with jay z to form a new record label but this cannot justify such an inconsistent and poor album ne yo confessed that the r b genre is suffering from serious malaise people just forgot what it was supposed to be what it was supposed to feel like the essence of what it is he says forcefully it 's a vibe it 's a feeling it 's supposed to make you feel something as opposed to `let me go eeh eeh eeh eeh eeh and put a beat behind it and see if people will dance to it ' come on man there 's more to it than that ring the alarm from b'day falls in the same category i read a reviewer who proclaimed b'day to be the best he 's ever had and this is like saying george bush is the best president america has ever had does this person know the beatles stevie wonder or aretha franklin \? i suggest him to go back to the stores and get one of their albums and he will then be able to differentiate between music and marketing i suggest the same reviewer to get albums called what 's going on' \( marvin gaye \) purple rain \( prince \) the day \( babyface \) or even the recent let 's get lifted \( john legend \) it is very sad to see artists \( especially hip hop \) concentrating on making hits shooting sexy videos with the major target being going platinum and most of the time i find it better to buy the single and not the entire album since they all are full of fillers what follows is that after a few months we completely trash their records africa is the world 's second largest and second most populous continent with 900 million people maybe if the same guys had a purchasing power which exceeds latino market beyonc would be realising another edition in swahili which is the most widely spoken language in africa and she would be arguing she 's had a great love for african culture ever since she was a child pretending she 's coming back to the roots anyway let 's not be fooled by these music industry games their aim is to make money and this entails ignoring the basic artistic aspects i agree bootylicious beyonce is the hottest lady in the music scene at the moment and none has denied her natural talent as a singer but she needs to refine her albums and give us s th that can reach our soul there are some female artists who are making good music without injecting too much cash in marketing to force sales corrine bailey rae and heather headley	24
0	as the reviews below indicate arthur has a lot of fans when it was released in 1981 vincent canby of the new york times found it a wonderful screwball comedy \( although over time times readers perhaps more discerning than vincent have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars \) and bravo listed it 10 on its list of best comedies \( see below \) i first saw dudley moore in foul play thought he was very funny based upon that i bought 10 and arthur as it turned out a downward trajectory what i dislike about arthur is moore playing a loud obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes and minelli playing a salt of the earth working girl who loves arthur for himself not for his 750 million fortune even john gielgud who was great in the loved one a much better comedy ca n't resurrect this turkey okay folks start casting your negative votes in the meantime here 's the bravo 100 best comedies list 100 anchorman99 the birdcage98 school of rock97 happy gilmore96 four weddings and a funeral95 harold kumar go to white castle94 waiting for guffman93 the aristocrats92 father of the bride91 revenge of the nerds90 clueless89 slapshot88 team america87 the kentucky fried movie86 zoolander85 dirty rotten scoundrels84 silver streak83 sister act82 tootsie81 half baked80 lost in america79 three amigos78 bananas77 flirting with disaster76 ghostbusters75 dumb and dumber74 trading places73 city slickers72 moonstruck71 roxanne70 the nutty professor \( eddie murphy \) 69 the blues brothers68 broadcast news67 kingpin66 dazed and confused65 office space64 this is spinal tap63 manhattan62 the pink panther61 election60 when harry met sally59 police academy series58 private benjamin57 swingers56 young frankenstein55 bull durham54 ferris bueller 's day off53 dr strangelove52 meet the parents51 national lampoon 's vacation50 the princess bride49 american pie48 american graffiti47 9 to 546 the incredibles45 raising arizona44 sixteen candles43 what about bob \? 42 harold and maude41 austin powers40 monty python and the holy grail39 mrs doubtfire38 best in show37 dodgeball36 good morning vietnam35 beetlejuice34 rushmore33 clerks32 groundhog day31 the big lebowski30 the 40 year old virgin29 legally blonde28 annie hall27 a fish called wanda26 wayne 's world25 meet the fockers24 bill ted 's excellent adventure23 big22 beverly hills cop21 shampoo20 the jerk19 wedding crashers18 stripes17 m a s h16 old school15 fast times at ridgemont high14 napoleon dynamite13 naked gun series12 the producers11 pee wee 's big adventure10 arthur9 ace ventura pet detective8 blazing saddles7 the wedding singer6 airplane5 south park bigger longer uncut4 there 's something about mary3 shrek2 caddyshack1 animal housemy suggested additions the loved one leap of faith used cars eulogy and drop dead gorgeous	24

0	i did n't enjoy the film i also did n't enjoy the original play by shakespeare king lear is one of my least favorite shakespeare plays i do n't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done and to add nothing of value to the original you can set it wherever you like in medieval japan or on the moon what 's the difference it 's king lear a downer of a play there 's nothing great about ran just as there 's nothing great about lear and it takes up three hours of your time a moron named lear or hidetoro or whatever his name is relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son the youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father he is right of course and hidetoro lear gets treated shabbily he 's wanted dead or dead in this treatment of the annoying plot he loses his mind he has a faithful follower or two they overact there is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play lear hidetoro is an absolute jerk am i supposed to care what happens to him \? why \? because he used to be a powerful king and a cruel one \? you may as well cry over saddam hussein look at this movie with fresh eyes look at shakespeare 's king lear with fresh eyes this stuff simply is not very entertaining and is not very good the hell with king lear he 's an annoyance	24

0	interesting premise but the plot is like swiss cheese this review will just be a point by point of all the major things that i found so implausable that i could n't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride spoilers alert i was n't able to make the leap to believing sarah 's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash when questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she could n't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort but satisfaction why did hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it \? surely it would n't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it 's disappearance the first murder after the old guy regained consciousness why did hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him \? for hank finishing the job his brother started did n't seem like an absolute last resort it seemed like he took the murder lightly when hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he 'd just done what \? like he knew she 'd be understanding about it or something \? hi honey i'm home by the way i just killed a man to protect the money wtf \? when jacob shot lou to protect hank why did n't hank just give the tape back before it got to that point \? the shotgun impact on lou 's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast did n't even hit her at an upward trajectory and the final ridiculous flaw jacob taking the fake fbi agent 's gun and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react he hands it to his brother and charges him with the responsibility of killing him setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film supposedly the explanation was that it would n't look like the fake fbi agent shot jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range but why not \? why could n't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff wrestled with him and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head \? it really makes no sense one inspiredly believable moment i will give them film credit for is hank 's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff 's office and loading the gun a lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded if the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film as it is it 's a frustratingly flaw ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch	24
1	i bought this bike after not riding since i was 14 \( 32 now \) the box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled i also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town i'm not a trail seeker so have never tried it off road very happy with the quality and ease of assembly	24
0	at first i did n't realize that you have to use amazon 's software to load onto the zen once i figured that out \( actually my husband figured that out \) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i was n't able to edit the stars if i could i would give this 5 stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon 's unbox is great for the zen	24
1	i'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents the candy apple is definitely the most accurate and i 'd sell my soul if i could only continue buying it on its own but the other 2 are good too the cotton candy is awesome but not 100 on accuracy and the cherry sno cone makes me start slobbering when i smell it highly recommended	24
1	for anyone on the fence about these jump over to my side \) my \( then \) 2 year old had gotten a hold of my husband 's permanent black marker we just bought a brand new refrigerator i turned my back for a few moments and when i looked back she had scribbled all over my new fridge i tried bleach soap scrubby sponges nothing worked my first new appliance was ruined ! on a whim i bought this \( could n't hurt right \? \) it got it off immediately ! \( i had to press a little bit to get it out of the grooves \) i was so excited i started running around my house trying to find things to scrub i know that it removes shoe scuffs with ease markers or crayons from walls and a multitude of other sins your children may commit against your home	24
0	this watch died \( battery \? \) one year after i bought it i like the watch it fits well and i'm able to swim in the pool and ocean with it but i ca n't find a place to repair it here on maui it has a 3 year warranty but i 'd have to mail it in after the battery is changed it needs to be pressure tested what a hassle	24
0	i was extremely disappointed when i received this product contrary to the description the handles are hard plastic not comfortable and soft as it states on the product packaging and website other than that it may be a decent product but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin i 've already printed the label to return to amazon beware the other review of this product the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on amazon not only is it not informative there is a good chance they have never tried the product	24
1	if you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block i can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable when you are pressing on the blocks they are firm enough to withstand your body weight but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you ca n't reach the floor in a pose the lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm there are many ways you can use these blocks and once i started to do the yoga step by step workouts yoga practice sessions i found i really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions the rebecca review	24
1	this camera is easy to use and makes a good quality recording since it is an upper end product it does have a longer learning curve than more simple models but the effort is worth it for the added features there are however a few quirks which could have been fixed to make this a much more usable piece of equipment the provided microphone jack is an 1 8 stereo in my camera at least it is not mounted very securely when i have an external mike connected i had to be very careful to make sure that nothing touched it otherwise the sound would drop off a friend with some tools and expertise fixed this problem but it should never have happened the master switch moves from off to vcr mode \( up one \) record to tape mode \( down one \) or record to stick mode \( down two \) it is intuitive but very easy to overshoot the mark this can be frustrating and i cannot help but believe there is a better design that could be used the vcr controls are located on the top surface of the camera they are intuitive and employ commonly used symbols they are also backlit and impossible to discern in sunshine you can see the symbols but there is no way to tell which if any of the functions are selected it is still usable but it is a pain in the backside there are a multitude of things that could be done to make the interface on this camera easier to use but it is usable as it is now	24
1	this is my favorite cereal i recommend it to everyone i can i eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time best of all it tastes great i agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty but probably useless as the body ca n't break down a whole flax seed to obtain the omega 3 but it adds nice texture and nuttiness also amazon has a great price on this vs grocery stores	24

1	i purchased this product over the summer 2006 when i became concerned about sun damage my only question about this product is whether the vitamin c in it is stable \( i e should the product be refrigerated to maintain its potency \? \) regardless it has a sufficient amount of vitamin c for the product to be worthwhile \( 10 woo hoo ! \) and other vitamin c creams are much more expensive the nice thing about this product is that a little really does go a long way you squeeze a small amount onto your finger \( hygienic packaging ! \) and spread onto your face as the product spreads it absorbs and has a silky finish i'm not sure why but i have taken to mixing this product with a little bit of cetaphil moisturizer and i love the result it does have an orangey citrus smell but i am not bothered by it \( which is rare \)	24
1	i'm dumbfounded by some of the reviews this page guess they just did n't get it this film is hilarious it 's clever witty and extremely entertaining travolta is classic as the pathetic gameshow host wannabe weather man the characters are so well defined and so sadly pathetic in their own ways it 's what makes the film such a classic comedy it 's unbelievable that more people have not caught on to it if you liked the big lebowski orange county the cable guy any film with esoteric characterization you will absolutely love this film it 's a dark comedy people get over it	24
1	this swim jock is a great all around jock very durable and very comfortable pouch and straps mine has taken a beating and has not fallen apart like other jocks i own the swim style is cut very low in front with a fairly small pouch not only is it great for working out under your workout pants or shorts it actually turns out to be a very sexy pair of underwear for everyday or play the low rise cut pairs very well with low rise jeans not to mention the barely there skimpy factor heat it up a little and try this jock under your low cut jeans looks and feels hot ! if you 're looking for a jock with less coverage and a lower waistband or just a comfortable sexy pair of underwear this jock is a great buy for the price	24
0	my dj side i actually had to stop the music open the tray on the cd player then check whether i had the right cd1 down tempo in or some other cd that my wife played before as the music was so not what i was expecting sounding more like deep forest than jvm to my surprise it was jimmy 's balance 10 i decided to keep an open mind and listen to it anyway i went to sleep after the 4th track the next day i decided to listen to the second cd \( mid tempo \) again i stopped the music opened the tray on the cd player then checked whether i had the \( mid tempo cd \) in instead of the down tempo i was playing the night before sure enough the \( mid tempo \) was what i had in the player but did not sound much different than the lullabies i was listening to on cd1 when the mid tempo was over i thought to myself well this would be very nice for an upcoming relaxing dinner with friends the next day i had high hopes for the up tempo cd cause well as the name implies it should be where the beats and treats are but no not really the only reason i did n't freak out from listening to the 1st and 2nd cd of jimmy van m 's balance release is because for three days i kept telling myself that there is an up tempo cd i did n't mind cd1 2 out of place pop tracks i did n't mind the different types of music being played in sequence or rather out of sequence i did n't mind hotel lobby music that reminded me of a hotel i stayed in two years ago in vienna all this will be forgivable when i hear the up tempo because i was so sure it 's going to be awesome unfortunately i was not quite right about my assumptions things did not start happening until track 5 \( the reducer 2 \) i do n't really need some 4 tracks on the third cd to get me warmed up jimmy warmed me up for 37 tracks before that in his down mid tempo crap for the most part this production of the balance series especially the first 41 tracks in sequence churned out some of the most lethargic way too slow and boring music that could be described at best as lullabies for grown ups as for the last 9 tracks of the up tempo it is actually dare i say decent enough but way too late and even worse ended prematurely it should have been re arranged with tracks in reverse order on every cd to be as follows \( cd3 \) up tempo should have been \( cd1 \) renamed \( in the car from club to home \) \( cd2 \) mid tempo should have been renamed \( at home in the living room \) and finally \( cd1 \) down tempo should have been \( cd3 \) renamed \( in your bedroom \) this just makes more sense the reason i say this is due to the disproportionate figures of dance tracks given to us \( 9 \) to the rest of the sleepy mellow ones \( 41 \) for example chill out house almost always start with a faster track or two then goes on to be slower gradually i have never come across a chill cd that opened with 10 fast tracks and ended with 03 slow ones that 's not chill jvm balance did exactly that took forever to ascend to a certain point then crashed almost immediately what gives \? half star for cd1half star for cd23 stars for cd3my human side dance music is not the only type of beautiful music out there duh ! jimmy made that very clear in this release if you want to listen to a wide range of \( not bad ! \) music then balance 10 is for you dive in jvm selection of what he thinks makes us human expressions of the soul that goes beyond our daily necessities to survive as a matter of fact we do n't even need music \( or any type of arts for that matter \) to survive at all still we listen to it we crave it and for many people their livelihood depends on it music can represent our feelings desires and wishes and with jvm deep forest like music here \( as i mentioned before \) i ca n't help but wonder if he is going through a certain period in his life where spirituality and oneness with the world is a priority i think it shows	24
1	since sunset boulevard is one of my favorite films i bought the london cast album long before the musical came to america patti lapone is the ultimate broadway star having created the role of evita her soaring versions of as if we never said goodbye and with one look are unmatched her power and vocal range soar ! all of norma 's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate glen close 's lack of \( or nonexistent \) singing ability in fact this dvd was unavailabe to the american market during the american run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves perhaps alw did n't want the american audience to hear the masterwork of this production kevin anderson a brilliant actor does not have the operatic quality of alan cambell in the u s cast but he portrayed joe gillis with far more guts and passion this is not for the lover 's of oklahoma of showboat but for lovers of more contemporary musicals this one is perfect	24
1	these crocs are very unique they have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot they are shaped like a birkenstock but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed the closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort i wear them just about everyday to work i chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because i work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea the ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation and because crocs float in water they make great shoes for boating or kayaking they drain well and dry out quickly plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it i know that a lot of doctors and nurses wear these because they allow you to stand comfortably for hours at a time they are also great because they can very easily be washed off completely in just a couple of minutes i wear them when i am gardening too and then just wash all the mud off the shoes with the hose outside in short the crocs are comfortable and versatile shoes treat your feet and buy them today	24

0	in an effort to boost their file numbers and appear to be more comprehensive the creators included many very low resolution images that they artsied or roughed up with a dirty polaroid transfer effect or split up into 5 small stagger stacked slides which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image for example if you do a search for tiger you will get 165 results but only 86 will be of the animal \( and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers or 5 images of one tiger striped chair cushion and so on \) and of those 86 80 have the crusty effect applied to them the other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head \( but have thankfully not been dirtied up with the transfer effect \) out of all there is not one clean image of a tiger in its environment here is another example a search for sunset yields 247 results of these 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied and 70 are the same images duplicated \( much smaller \) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides there are two clean sunset images these are typical results numbers do n't mean anything ! this product is stuffed with multiple images of toys frankly not so attractive people from hard angles and old low resolution stock photos to achieve 150 000 files would it have killed them to include one clean print resolution image in each category \? perhaps we could have done without 50 of the fake slide images \( talk about dated anyway ! \) in order to get a product worth having around	24
0	my blood was boiling as i read other customers' rave reviews of the prince of tides whoever considers this thesaurus scrubbing self indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature someone was even audacious enough to compare pat conroy to virginia woolf what a joke ! woolf 's writing is brilliant original and real she cuts to the quick whereas conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions one can almost see conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is nor how unrealistic it makes the story i laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths in the real world nobody is as self concious and self reflexive as the characters in this book they do not speak in reams of figurative language i cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are especially the children also conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them \( i make that claim as a southerner who lived in nyc for four years \) it 's one of many many flaws in this ridiculous book read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal \( john irving etc \) but avoid it if you have any respect for the english language and for real american literature \( cheever plath hemingway cather etc \) do n't be fooled by all the fools out there	24
0	i really like the rosetta stone product \( although it is over priced \) warning rosetta stone \( fairfield language technologies \) will not replace a cd if it is lost stolen or damaged unless you bought the product directly from them \( and then they charge you 30 for a replacement cd \) i had the misfortune of purchasing from a local bookstore and someone had stolen the disk from inside the package in this case i can get my money back from the store i bought it from but since you ca n't backup the disks you had better be very careful to not lose one	24
0	i bought this about a year ago based on great reviews i'm not surprised to see bad reviews a year later problems the uneven weight difference causes the aria to pullthe small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete \( forget the grass at the park \) the trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheeriosthe fabric storage area underneath is held up with six buttonholes that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bagthe straps are really tricky to figure out and i 've never been able to get them rightthe shades are very small and next to worthlessthe drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the strollerfor the money i spent i wish i 'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel it 's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child but how herculean you become once you have two also the whole one handed open close feature that i craved on my single stroller is a non issue when you have two kids because it 's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway if i could i 'd sell this one and get a jogger \( i need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground \) but i do n't think i could sell this one for more than 20 in clear conscience a shame	24

1	robert redford has proved us his undeniable artistic gifts in previous occasions but with this giant movie he really achieved that coveted pearl the state of art in all its wholeness redford crossed over the traditional concessions and he got to prove art and cinema should not be divorced good taste and profitability may gather and shake hands if you respect the sensibility and intelligence of the spectator this picture not only broke the walls and not only became the most ambitious artistic and perfect american film in the last quarter of century besides the mature and sensitive script around an awful event that will transform the livings and expand the reduced frontiers of two different ways of life enhancing them when the tragedy became an unexpected gate for the bliss redford' s artistic personality has a secure place in the immortality and i really hope for him to bring us future films filled of that enriched vision where the rude vulgarity the visible special effects big circus and the simple anecdote not only be absent and so the new directors to come understand the true cinema meaning is art thanks to his generous personal effort for having created the sundance festival for new directors whose fruits will create new approaches and major visions special kudos to him due that clinical eye for a very young actress in progress at those years scarlet johansson	24

0	i began using gillette 's mach 3 razor when it first came on the market and was very happy with it \( until recently \) the original mach 3 would give consistently good smooth shaves and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves that was an excellent product however with the introduction of the new fusion razor the mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves i was getting were much rougher i had heard about the fusion and decided to try it instead figuring may that gillette was trying to migrate its users towards the fusion by downgrading their reliable old product putting all their new design juice behind the newer model i was shocked by what a shoddy difficult product the fusion razor turned out to be i went from getting several good shaves per razor to well none i'm lucky with the fusion to get two decent shaves per cartridge usually it roughs my skin up on the very first pass and it does n't cut my beard back right to the skin the way the mach 3 used to what 's the deal \? did gillette decide they no longer wanted to provide a quality product \? that they 'd rather have customers have to buy a new razor right away rather than have us use the same cartridge a few times before needing to buy another one \? if so that marks a huge change in their corporate policy from giving us a quality product to basically shoving customers around and trying to rip us off i know they can make a great razor they used to but if gillette has decided to stop doing a good job then forget it so much for my customer loyalty i 'll either switch brands or stop shaving until there 's another razor on the market that provides comparable quality to the old mach 3	24
1	200 american is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy even though it looks like a no budget episode of queer as folk or intended to be a gay version of pretty woman it 's got a pretty good story it does n't rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography most of the actors are straight playing gay roles i was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show something that i can certainly relate to the acting is acceptable but not great because most of the actors are not that experienced i was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer ! the movie has some kind of charm about it perhaps it 's because it 's so sincere and gimmick free and even the love scenes are very low key i was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss there is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor it 's very captivating sean matic did a good job with his light austrilian accent by the way it 's worth rental fee for sure	24

1	instyle is my favorite fashion magazine out there it is much more reader friendly than vogue much cleaner layout the font is easier to read and the writing is clear witty and less dry i 've been reading instyle for about 3 years and each issue never disappoints me the focus of the magazine is definitely fashion but there are also makeup tips and celebrity news the magazine targets a much broader audience than more haute couture magazines like vogue my favorite section is the look which highlights celebrity fashion and also has a section at the end that profiles a specific designer or label instyle also features many tips and recommendations on beauty products the best issue of the year is without a doubt in march or april when they do best beauty buys after polling beauty experts and testing hundreds of products they feature the best beauty products in ever imaginable category i 've discovered some of my favorite beauty products through these issues and it 's nice to be able to trust a source without wasting your money on testing out expensive products that do n't work for you it is the best source for getting the most reliable products out there from hair care products to makeup i have seen several women at sephora clutching torn out pages from instyle 's best beauty buys and frantically searching for the right mascara i understand that vogue is an institution now but instyle offers a much better alternative and provides articles that you actually want to read and tips you actually use	24

0	from amazon ca the action replay max is more than just a video game enhancer \( vge \) or at least it claims to be my version is quite old yet but it claims to include a region free dvd player and a memory card compression utility \( squeeze more saves onto your memory card \) i have not used either of these features personally but i have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards some reusable some permanently damaged this and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it however the real reason i bought the armax was for its codes and i 'll get to those in a second the armax like the newer gamesharks loads its software from a cd this is a major annoyance for me every time you load a game you must insert the armax memory card \( which does i do n't know what \) and cd go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load choose your codes then get up and put the actual game dvd in and wait for it to load you ca n't simply turn on your ps2 and go sit down in the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the vge between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down the early generation gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the ps1 or n64 and that was it if you wanted it to load before the game you turned on its switch even if the armax was perfect in every other way \( and it 's not btw \) it would get a maximum of 4 stars as long as you had to boot it from a cd first i mean why ca n't the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you 're playing after the system is shut off or reset so you do n't have to load the software every d mn time ok rant over on to the codes the user interface for the armax is better than the gameshark functionally they are very similar of course but the armax just feels cleaner and easier to use it offers a beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions \( not for user entered ones though if i remember right \) and a more robust expert mode on big advantage in theory that the armax has over the gameshark is its ability to update itself using your ps2 's broadband connection the upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller the dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download its all or nothing and since these updates are stored on your memory card \( not the armax one \) it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games 99 of which you will never play ! no wonder the armax has the option to come with 16 or 32mb of space on its memory card it 's to store all the useless codes ! any entered codes you choose to apply will either work do nothing or lock up the game i have come across all though to armax 's credit mostly the former the absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the ps2 library when you may want just one loses the armax another star a note about manually entering codes the sub headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game 's code list finally as mentioned in the reviews by bret morris and glenn nichols \( amazon ca \) the armax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat ps2 a couple years ago at all this happened for me as well i returned three ps2s and two armaxes before i realized it was a defect in all current versions \( at the time \) of armax i had to send away and get a new disc direct from intec which now works as well as expected since the armax has been on shelves for several years since i bought mine i assume any bought today would not have this problem however at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting intec personally retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the codejunkies web site this inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops armax down to two stars in my opinion if you 're in the market for a vge both armax and gameshark have their pros and cons i would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones i have looks at the specs assume nothing and do n't be afraid to e mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about i apologize for the length of this review but i find there are very few in depth reviews of vges on the web or in print maybe reviewers feel they are above using vges i do n't know	24

0	i purchased quickbooks 2005 4th upgrade in 10 years unlike earlier versions this one is confusing and painful to use simple things like making deposits has to do through contraptions one of the reasons i upraded was to use online banking it 's a complete disaster it does n't download the complete trasaction details reconcilliations are very difficult you will be doing twice the work to use it once my transfer to the bank was aborted by a message saying you are low on memory and though quickbooks sent the transaction to the bank it did n't mark it internally so on the next login it sent the payment again ! ! ! it has cost me 1509 of double payment that i am still trying to get back ! how you pay a bill is totally messed up there is no way for you to mark that a bill was paid online unless it was done through quickbooks online connection \( bank 's billpay ca n't be used ! ! \) it 's very poor in organization you ca n't have 2 accounts 's with a vendor \( still in 2005 ! ! ! \) it has introduced obscure concepts as items and classes which have no real definition and no default use and stop every transaction one of the biggest thing quickbooks has done to hurt their customers is the payroll technically you can do it yourself but they hide that information and scare you in every step that you should \( must \) buy the 299 year payroll service \( old tax tables \) in all the documenation not once do they mention that you can do the payroll directly and this is how compared to the earlier products this is a huge cost by that reckoning i would have paid 2000 for the previous version of quickbooks ! ! it 's definitely cheaper to buy a basic version of the software and use an accountant to do the other work and you will be betteroff do n't waste money on quicken services or premium products they will bleed you to death on your way to a mental asylum	24

0	on the whole bicycling is a huge disappointment i agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good but i do n't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two i read those in the newstand further as i will mention below once and a while there is a real gem of an article in the meantime almost everything else they do is poor the entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros training obsessively and fighting with that last 1 of body fat the reality is what bicycling 's readership principally is is rich in their own pages they recently listed average household income of a subscription at 115 000 so it 's not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride it 's people with the ability to buy what the pros ride the result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this 3000 bikes \( and as one reviewer said the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around 1500 wait 1500 is not chump change \? ! \? ! \) advanced training and eating techniques etc as opposed to real world riding centuries and club rides touring commuting \( gasp ! \) etc even it 's racing coverage is terrible its recent spread on the san fran gp one of the three most important races in the us was 6 pages of photos 4 of which were of people watching the race not the racing itself for me though the worst part is its hypocrisy in a recent issue there was a truly excellent article on what the author called invisible riders low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday yet the author mentioned several times \( albeit with embarrassment \) that he was riding a seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on 100 bikes the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday a movement which riders like bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize \( maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting \) and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from 3500 7000 really really sad one star for invisible riders and the like and that 's it	24

1	sophia loren is without arugment the most beautiful and sexy foreign actress in movie history beginning in the mid 1950 's she did a string of italian films and became the first foreign born actress to come to hollywood and make the crossover in mainstream american movies starting with the pride and the passion in 1957 \( it was this film and houseboat that loren began her close relationship with cary grant \) and at the same time blew fellow italian bella gina lollobridga out of the water as the best actress to come out of italy in 1960 loren went back to italy to film the world war ii film two women a year and a half later to everybody 's surprise she won the oscar for best actress and became the first foreigner of that era to win the academy award but if there was one film that summed up just how damn sexy sophia loren was it came with yesterday today and tomorrow the scene in which she strips in front of marcello mastronini 's character has to be considered the greatest strip scene in film history and also the most sexiest in film history too \( hope premiere magazine does a list like it someday \) and that is the scene in which you say to everybody this is sophia loren in my opinion loren may have been the first actress in movie history to be on screen in their lingerie there is a shirt that says italians do it better could 'it' be referring to sex \? if so we can give thanks to sophia loren	24

0	after reading the reviews this sounded like an easy choice i was very wrong when i first plugged it in i could not believe how quickly the wipes heated i thought it was great i did think they were way too hot after they were in a while but a quick shake after i pulled one out cooled it down enough to make it safe then a few days later i was pulling them out and the inner lid popped open and kept popping open with every change then when i lifed the unit to put new wipes in my 700 changing table dresser was flooded and warped ! \( i had it replaced ! ! \) i had not known it because the pad and a basket were on the table too same problems kept happening so i called combi customer service told me the instruction manual states that the wipes are to be left in the packaging she said that the excess moisture which caused the flooding would be held by the packaging of course i could not measure the amount of fluid but i am not exaggerating when i say cups ! even if it did hold the cups of water so when the plastic pacaking is empty and no longer has wipes it is filled with excess cups of moisture and then you have to remove that to dispose of it \? \? \? \? and although it is stated a \) there should be a warning to never use wipes not in a package and b \) why ! i bought a large bag of huggies wipes there is no package to pop in second she told me that the unit is not supposed to stay plugged in all the time and that this too is in the manual so i lookeed at that too not in the usage part but on the back under cautions it states this unplug power cord when not in use okay when you have a newborn when are you not using your wipes lol ! she said it should be plugged in and unplugged several times a day to keep them warm ! ! ! i guess a new mom is supposed to schedule that ! and if that was an acceptable property of the product should n't there be a switch \? \? i would have to move the dresser every time or get an extention cord of course ! crazy ! combi gave me what i consider ridiculous answers they also need to get real when they write the manual for the record i have written a review one other time to rave about my little bissell this frustrated me so much i had to share the info ! ! ! ! ! ! also this is baby 4 so i am quite familiar with baby products	24

0	i'm not exactly sure how to classify this nor do i think it really deserves the time how this album has garnered so many positive reviews is beyond me my only guess is that some tired pretentious teen on myspace raved over it and voila the clique was born now i really wanted to like this and gave it numerous listens but each time it sounds more and more like these guys were just doing some busy work around the house started humming some melodies and then recorded them immature and pretty much unoriginal and just because an album is labeled concept does n't automatically qualify it as a masterpiece if you want a flawless concept album that actually has an interesting story just go and buy the wall unless your circle of friends has threatened to emascualte you for not owning this do n't bother with this bloat	24

1	fortune is a classic on the newsstand and is as vital and important today as ever fortune generally caters to people with a managerial bent especially upper level executives but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world the global and national economic climate and forward looking technology and trend information each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story like the enron trial or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year i do enjoy the articles where they rank things but more than the rankings themselves i am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings while i do n't always agree with the magazine i do always find it good food for thought the features are generally very polished and accurate and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a ceo as to a college business student i particularly appreciate the interviews that fortune has with key players in the financial industry and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue the magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like kiplinger 's nonetheless the investment advice and insight fortune offers should generally be held in high esteem i also appreciate the coverage of key trends and in particular want to note that fortune has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in america coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money while there are several i would recommend fortune remains a reliable source of information on macro level trends and should be a part of everyone 's business library	24

0	ahh iron eagle a classic of the 1980 's golan globus production mill with the current spate of historic current military movies it 's sometimes good to see how hollywood 's come in trying to get the details right one ca n't do much better than using this flick as a baseline in case you are n't already familiar with this gem louis gosset jr playing a reserve air force colonel and a teenage kid fly a mission inside an unnamed arab country ok i 'll name it libya to rescue the kid 's dad pop gets shot down when he 's intercepted in international waters but the us refuses to do anything more than diplomatic pressure the kid and lou gosset meet up when the kid 's challenged to race the local bully with his plane while the bully 's using his dirt bike suffice it to say he wins and impresses his babe he does n't get his slot at the usaf academy though you gotta take the bad with good i guess when the words on dad get back to the family this kid uses his base network to get access to imagery enemy air defense data and two f16s carrying a b52 's worth of ordinance all of this being done by his friends exploiting the dim bulbs who are their parents no less \( if only strike planning was this easy \) of course the kid has flown training missions with his dad and has a boatload of simulator time so he 's a natural to fly the mission he convinces gosset to go along with him and his two ship is on the way the flying scenes are nothing spectacular with obviously israeli f16s playing the good guys and kfirs \( modified mirages \) acting as migs cockpit scenes are completely the imagination of the set designer i'm guessing he never was anywhere near a real aircraft these are especially dated now as many computer flight sims are pretty darn accurate in cockpit flight and combat models anyway lots of explosions on the way in lou gets hit and aborts and our hero must press on alone go figure he manages to talk with the evil dictator directly and get his dad on the runway for him to land \( ! \) and pick him up more silliness ensues as he launches weapons on the ground taxi 's out and takesoff he kills the bad guy and heads home to find lou punched out and was rescued rather than the prison sentence for espionage and theft of government property that lou the kid his pals and the idiots they exploited on base should 've got he gets his slot at the air force academy the end overall i guess lou 's performance was fairly good but everyone else performed at the grade b level this flick is note especially a very young shawnee smith as one of the kid 's buds worth seeing for laughs and as a film version of a kid 's pilot fantasy	24

1	there are already tons of reviews on the eos 300d \( digital rebel \) but i do want to share my experience with the camera so i will keep this short i bought this camera about 5 months ago and i am in love with i was not new to photography or to slr 's but new to the world of digital slr i had previously used an ancient minolta x 570 a pro sumer 35mm film slr with a vivitar 35 105 standard zoom lens first and foremost this camera takes excellent pictures very high quality and no distortion that i have seen this camera is particularly good as a beginner 's dslr because there are so many options to use and learn but until you are ready to take advantage of all the featues you can use this just like a point and shoot battery life has been excellent so far thought i would suggest getting an extra to have as a backup for long days of taking photos i have also been quite happy with the kit lens which i was n't sure i would like since it is not as versatile as the lens i had been using on my minolta but the kit lens has proved to be a great learning tool i have been able to take some great shots while also learning what kinds of other better lenses i would like to add to my setup the only issue i have had was a problem with a sandisk 2gb cf card after about 300 shots the camera froze and stopped responding to that card i was able to salvage most of the photos after the fact but do n't risk it if you 're serious enough to spend this kind of money on a camera spend a little extra money on the sandisk ultra ii line of high speed cards	24

0	i bought this camera for my 13 year old son to take with him on a soccer trip to bermuda it was ok felt sort of cheap but seemed like it would do what it was supposed to big drawback there is no lens cover that slips into place when a picture is n't being shot so the danger of scratching the lens is immense my son was so afraid of scratching the lens that he barely used it some of the few pictures that he did take were ok but others were not of the best quality i think this camera is a bit too costly for what you get and i'm surprised because i usually love samsung products	24
0	you could get the same info on percentage of body fat by going online think about it how does a scale measure your body fat \? good question so i went to the website of the manufacturer and surprise surprise there were no details about how this worked it did however note what it was supposed to detect and how that might connect to body fat the scale supposedly measures something called electrical impedence which sounds pretty complex but really is n't all that hard to understand all it means is that the more fat you have in your body the more impedence you have and the higher the body fat reading electricity does n't flow as well through fat and the scale is supposed to detect that but here is the catch getting an accurate body fat measurement can not possibly be done by just stepping on a scale especially if the consumer \( buyer \) of that scale does n't understand the factors that are vital to an accurate measurement what you have in your body when you step on the scale is one vital factor here is just one example of how easy it would be to get a bad reading if you are dehydrated from not drinking enough water or conversely you are overhydrated from drinking too much water or you have n't measured your body fat within a certain amount of time after exercise or you 've been standing too long or you 've eaten recently you are very likely to get an inaccurate reading and you 'll be confused by the variation in readings from one day to the next not knowing what factor or combination of factors is affecting your reading even worse you 'll have no real idea of your body fat from what i 've seen these scales do provide accurate weight measurements but when it comes to measuring body fat the ads or website do not seem to indicate that you can get an inaccurate reading if you step on the scale at the wrong time of day too soon after exercising if you are thirsty etc so save your money if you are working out regularly eating right getting in shape etc odds are that your body fat is dropping and you 'll see signs of this you do n't need this scale to prove it \( although you might consider it worthwhile to discover your actual body fat some other way \) signs of reduced body fat are firmer muscles looser clothes and \( often \) a more streamlined figure your metabolism is likely to be more efficient assuming you do n't overeat too much if you absolutely have to know your percentage of body fat just ask your local physician trainer or gym director how to get an accurate assesment and when to do so if you workout regularly at the suggested or peak training level your body fat should go down assuming you do n't compensate by eating too much so do n't count on this scale to give you the consistency or quality of a detailed and controlled body fat measurement it wo n't	24
1	i love this soundtrack ! it stands alone as beautiful haunting alluring and innocent just as griet herself was in the film desplat perfectly captured the spirit of the story enhanced and deepened a plot that was less than stellar scarlett johanssen 's acting is superb as well as essie davis and colin firth the story though was a bit tired pretty housemaid jealous wife do nothing husband its portrayal of vermeer and his wife was a disservice to the real people even though it is a fictionalized account the two best tracks on this album are 'griet 's theme' and 'colours in the clouds' while i'm not keen on seeing the film again this soundtrack is a treasure it 's a real work of art second only to vermeer 's work	24
0	i bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock money thrown away ! ! the camera does n't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk also in my opinion it truly is junk now as i got so frustrated with it i threw it on the floor and smashed it not kidding ! when i first got it i called kodak and they told my son \( who is knowledgeable in this stuff \) how to reset the printer we reset it and it worked for awhile then it would n't work any more and i did away with it no more kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked	24

1	i got this camera so i could have more control i'm learning to use the shutter and aperture settings i have n't explored all the fancy settings much but there are tons of them i really like the continuous shooting option so i'm more likely to catch a good action shot the wide angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close ups i think it 's one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos but do n't feel quite ready for an slr	24
1	i have had the ws 2310 for 3 months and i must say that it has been a pleasure to use for what you get it 's an excellent value and i have found it reliable and a joy to use that said i echo the comments about the wireless features and installed my unit as a wired system i wanted to avoid having to change batteries on sensors mounted in difficult to reach areas i also found out that the system particularly the rain sensor is rf sensitive as a ham radio operator i found a 10 watt 2m transmitter 15 feet away caused errant readings to solve this i did two things i moved the 2m antenna and i added several wraps on ferrite cores for the telephone cables that connect the sensors and the main unit after reading the documentation on the heavy weather software supplied with the unit i decided i was looking for a more complete package and purchased weather display this interfaced perfectly with my ws 2310 and has resulted in a reliable and accurate system you can see my weather system online at http bwusa homeip net 14501 info html i also feed data to weatherunderground and other systems in all there is no doubt that there are more rugged systems available but they are far more expensive which would have made my project impossible	24

0	this film like most of his early work is for hitchcock aficionados only i am an admirer of hitchcock and also enjoy old british films but i still found this movie tough going not least because of the 110 mins running time the picture quality of this laserlight dvd is not perfect but it is perfectly watchable and probably a lot better than you 'd expect for the price the musical score is also okay but nothing to write home about laserlight do however pose a mystery that hitch himself would have been proud of this dvd has no commentary no documentary and no trailer not even one of those awful tony curtis intros so why do laserlight describe this dvd as a 'special edition'	24
1	book looks exactly like the picture and the colors are vivid and nice the only thing is the puppet holes are really small meant for small fingers so you as a parent might not be able to show your child how to use the puppet feature i like this line of books better the the bright starts and baby einstein books	24
0	the key to my heart lipgloss chain is a very cute original idea but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the hard candy name the reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty all very true i got my keychain in the pixie tones and they 're girly and pretty and i was feeling pretty cool about it however for me the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it now i 've always been a fairly careful person i'm not klutzy nor do i drop or lose things my keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be i never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that 's normal and yet after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice the first time i was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition the second time however i only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because i saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo how did it come apart like this \? i honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse i can honestly only chalk it up to really really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that it was a good idea but too low quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain this is not the way to go for gloss on your keys	24

0	very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5 8 of the story i add 1 8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained but too often this reference becomes a one sided sermon for free trade these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton repubs kept the song going without missing a beat most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies the rich get richer in both parties feel free to read to learn about terms just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path	24

1	i do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of buffy the vampire slayer as scaling operatic heights culminating with the glorious aria of becoming part 2 which i still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television i have ever seen in my life i have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life so i believe i can make a pretty convincing case we witnesses the potential of this series in season 1 when creator joss whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious angel was really a vampire who just happened to have a soul and loved the slayer until half way through the abbreviated first season in season 2 we find out just how far true love can go wrong love continues to be a very painful thing for the scooby gang as cordelia \( some assembly required \) xander \( inca mummy girl \) and joyce \( ted \) find out then again prospects look much better for willow \( phases \) although we never really do take the cordelia xander romance \( go fish \) to be anything more than a cosmic joke which does offer up the delightfully twisted bewitched bothered and bewildered as the exception that proves the rule \( footnote buffy spends most of the episode as the buffy rat because sarah michelle gellar was hosting snl that week \) of the off arc stories halloween and ted are clearly the best of the bunch but when it comes to romance buffy and angel are truly on the road to hell paved with the best of intentions it is clear in the season premier episode when she was bad that things are different when buffy dances seductively with xander taunting him with her sexuality the ante has been upped considerably the pivotal point in the season comes with episode 13 \( of 22 \) surprise when buffy unknowingly undoes angel 's curse on the night of her 17th birthday by making love to him why the gypsies put in the faustian \( in the goethe sense \) escape clause via the moment of true happiness and contentment is debatable but the galvanizing effect on the show is truly impressive when angelus brutally slays jenny calendar in passion leaving her body in a grotesque display for giles to discover in his bed \( while opera music soars in the background \) it is the symbolic hellmouth of the show opening up the audience is shocked into realizing how bad things can get only the worst is yet to come giles 's anger buys him one shot at angelus but buffy has to rescue him they turn on each other in anger and buffy actually slugs him to the ground before they collapse weeping in each other 's arms buffy tells him i ca n't do this alone but this proves to be most ironically incorrect clearly whedon constructs each season around two half season story arcs the first half of season 2 heralds the arrival of spike and dru and the quick departure of the annoying one of course now we look back and are amazed at what james marsters has done with the role of spike but at this point it is juliet landau 's ditzy psychotic vampire who provides the flair of the dark side whedon brings the first half to a climax in what 's my line \? the show 's first two parter where we are introduced to kendra the vampire slayer it seems buffy 's brief moment of death at the hands of the master in prophecy girl has some long reaching implications we only begin to appreciate at this point but with the return of angelus everything changes spike and drusilla are trying to reassemble the judge a grotesque who cannot be killed by any weapon forged then everybody learns the truth about not only angel 's transformation but also jenny 's betrayal thus begins the deadly game of cat and mouse between angel and his former allies which culminates in the two parts of becoming both parts of becoming are written and directed by whedon and represent the apex of his work on the series when angeleus opens the portal to hell only his blood can close it but things are not going to be that easy for buffy the dramatic culmination contains the best fight sequence \( with swords \) in a show that prides itself on innovative staging of its fights and is an ultimately emotionally shattering experience captured beautifully by sarah michelle gellar 's slow dissolve into tears while the haunting sarah mclachlan song full of grace is played joss whedon had set this moment up from the first episode of the series it is a payoff usually reserved for the final episode of a series and not simply the end of the second season becoming is truly an astounding accomplishment in the history of dramatic television and when you watch the entire second season again you can appreciate how brilliantly this shattering conclusion is set up the original theatrical film was a teaser the first season on television was an appetizer but the second season of buffy the vampire slayer was epic and once you see this whether again or for the first time you are not going to want to stop here it was also nice to see that the extras went up a couple of notches for the season 2 dvd collection especially since we expect more goodies from whedon and crew especially given the high quality of the watchers guide the show 's official companion volumes there was a lot of thought put into this show which means any and all insights and looks behind the curtain are greatly appreciated	24
1	theodore b taylor the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004 but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester even though the text of this book originally appeared in the new yorker in 1973 taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation mcphee has a very understated style \( just the facts ma'am \) but this book is still the most frightening i 've ever read i ca n't decide whether i would want him to write a sequel because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973 just ask yourself the following questions is there more plutonium available to terrorists in 2006 than there was in 1973 \? yes do more nations have nuclear capability \? yes can a nuclear bomb be built that is even smaller and more efficient than its 1973 counterpart \? yes are the instructions for building a nuclear device more readily available than they were in 1973 \? yes do some people hate america even more than they did in 1973 \? decide this one for yourself john mcphee staff writer for the new yorker and pulitzer prize winning author of twenty seven books on subjects as various as oranges and the merchant marine has written a nuclear explosion of a book in the curve of binding energy it 's one of those books that is even more relevant now than when it was written essentially it 's a blueprint of how to build a nuclear device using materials at hand along with a chunk of rather easily stolen u 235 or plutonium theodore b taylor himself the creator of smaller more efficient nuclear bombs tells us where to steal the plutonium how to assemble a bomb even gives hints on where to plant it one of the eeriest parts of this book has taylor and mcphee exploring the now vanished towers of the world trade center trying to pick the spot where a nuclear device could do the most damage the curve of binding energy is a must read for every man jack and paper pusher in the department of homeland security not to mention both houses of congress i imagine the first reaction of many congresspersons would be to ban this book but it 's way too late for that my friend	24

0	my first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking then i tried to use it i mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer in the first day of use i just ran out of patience and plan to return it here 's the problems i had with the altitech21 most of the time the buttons work fine but several times i pressed the mode button and the mode did not change 2 when setting declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press set reset light to reverse the digits but as soon as you press the set reset light button the unit ends the calibration mode 3 the temperature was stuck at 87 5 degrees for about an hour after purchase finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81 5 degrees i held the unit in front of the ac vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees i suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees the temperature display never budged from 81 5 degrees 4 i constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber the digital thermometer registered 78 degrees the altitech2 registered 81 4 degrees i blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer the digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and i turned the heat off the altitech2 stayed at exactly 81 4 degrees after removing from the chamber the altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees went down to 92 6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees 5 the compass will only stay on for 10 seconds then the display turns off to conserve battery this never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map when the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display since this button is recessed you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail \( i had to \) this moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button i 'll stick with my 19th century compass for now this unit might be worth keeping for me if the altimeter is reliable but after all the other trouble i had i did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as i had lost confidence in the device	24
1	we loved the mini co sleeper ! our son used it until he was around 4 months and his trasition into his crib was so easy i loved having him right next to me without the worry of rolling on him or waking him up in our bed i could check on him just by looking at him or putting my hand on him and i didnt even have to roll out of bed the mini co sleeper was so portable that i never even bought a pack n play we traveled a lot the first few months with our son and it was so easy to take his bed with us i highly reccomend the mini co sleeper and the leg extensions were great since our bed was a little high i will use this for our next baby as well	24
0	i have been a loyal fan of quicken for many years my things have changed for the worst at the once mighty intuit it pains me to report that quicken deluxe 2007 is a work in progress 1 the installation cd was unreadable to intuit 's credit i was given access to their download site for replacement software 2 the reconciliation report \( needed for balancing your checkbook \) will not display or print for some reason all other reports display and print just fine unfortunately the reconciliation report is the only one i am truely interested in printing i am using a brother hl 5280dw laser printer the printer works fine with all other programs including the old version of quicken again the most important report \( reconciliation \) will not print on quicken deluxe 2007 3 the software would not recognize the c drive as a working drive even though the program is running on that drive \( \? \) go figure 4 the overseas tech support is willing to play dumb and pretend they do n't know there is a problem with the software keeping you in the chat room for hours i guess as long as they get paid it does n't matter whether they help or not the ultimate recommendation is to reload the software just one more time as a past happy user of quicken 2004 i was forced into this upgrade do n't expect the problems to be resolved quickly intuit has been aware of most of these problems for over 6 months i hate to be the bearer of bad news but this version of quicken is just that bad news	24

1	after a week of testing this camcorder i found it good enough for daily use the hd2 does not come with an sd card so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the hd2 i got a 2gb sd a data and a 4gb sdhc qpi class6 both worked fine the 4gb gives me about 1 20h in standardhd mode and 55mns in superhd mode i did n't notice a speed difference between a class2 and a class6 sd card using the hd2 i think you should be fine with an 8gb sdhc class2 my first impression of the camera is how small it is however it may not fit in a jean pocket it turns on very quick you can start filming within 2secs of startup it has a lady voice telling the mode you are using \( ie camera mode \) not sure if this is useful for others but not for me the video and still pictures are great outdoor the video quality is impressive during a bright sunlight in a room lighten by a 60w equivalent fluo light the video quality is grainy noisy this has been confirmed by other people as well the high sensitivity feature \( to boost the image quality at low light \) helps but not enough my 7yrs old sony digital8 does a better job at 1lux i noticed that video quality is grainy at low light but 7mp still picture quality is very good for the same lighting compared to my new canon sd800 at 7mp it is obvious the canon digital camera wins on the video side i played with several configuration iso setting white balance resolution etc it does helps but the video is still grainy at low light this camcorder has not been designed for low light filming i ran into an issue when transfering the video pictures from the hd2 with its cradle to the pc via usb connection i got errors transfering the files if you use the craddle \( this will freeze the hd2 \) i am not sure why i have to check with sanyo on this if you connect the hd2 directly to the pc \( without the cradle \) the transfer goes smooth so there is an issue with the cradle and usb port i am also using pinnacle studio 10 5 for my video editing so far i have not been able to use it and control my hd2 you can however copy the files from sd to your pc and use these files with pinnacle studio since i film most of the time outdoor during daytime this camera does the job fine and video quality is great i would still give a 5 stars even with the video issues at low light	24
1	i find these soaps to be very good there are actually 4 different kinds i believe one also for sensitive skin if someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type this soap is similiar to dhc soaps from japan if they are to drying try using the correct soap for help i would suggest going to the clinque counter or ask me	24

0	my friends and i had high hopes for this game we played cod2 multiplayer every week and were excited about a new shooter after playing cod3 for a few rounds we decided to put 2 back in the graphics are great but we found a lot of bugs there were some shading problems with the helmets that made them turn white at a certain distance that 's fine if you want to be a un soldier but not if you 're trying to sneak up on somebody muzzle flashes were almost none existent no blood splash like in cod2 the single player game is n't too bad so far but if you plan on multiplayer i would recommend renting it first we were of the opinion that the game was rushed maybe they 'll patch it	24

1	i have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto dvd it is here ! a very good movie i have to say the inspector carson \( belonging to an unknown federal agency \) character played by kurtwood smith is good if not great acting he epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate his lines in the movie \( particularly when he and border patrol agent bobby logan kris kristofferson \) discuss 'politics' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best the conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra great bit part acting by rip torn roberts blossom \( as the desert rat \) tess harper and the young and sultry jean smart kris kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and treat williams does ok as well anyone who has been in law enforcement or any other supervisory capacity for that matter has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the border patrol totally inept the soundtrack by tangerine dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes a must see movie	24

1	this is a great \( and relatively cheap \) way to expand your brio starter set a nice selection of straights curves and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction fun while brio in general is expensive this track pack represents a pretty good value \( v buying switches curves straights etc on their own although you 'll need to do that eventually too ! \) the finish fit and quality is great worth the money considering the play it 'll get it 's durability	24
1	and i knew it would n't be the last very very fun do n't think nancy drew is just for girls guys can play and love the game as well i am living proof of that the game itself really is n't that hard it is just some of the puzzles can be very tricky \( i do n't like puzzles \) and that is the only 'beef' i have with the game and most mystery games now back to the game itself intriguing storyline suspicous characters and they all got something to hide search for clues while interrogating suspects explore the resort run errands break into locked rooms without getting caught disable alarms and snoop and that is just the tip of the iceburg if you like mystery games nancy drew is for you ! her games are n't overly hard and they are very fun even if you are n't a mystery fan try it ! you 'll love it try them all ! you will become a nancy drew fan trust me i did	24
0	first of all i am a fan of madonna 's music \( not all of it but a lot of it \) as well as a huge abba fan now i realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists and apparently it is here as well but why ca n't these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic \? gimme gimme gimme \( the abba song that is sampled here \) is a fairly simple song to begin with \( as many abba songs are \) but the complicated arrangements \( both vocally and instrumentally \) are what made abba 's songs interesting and fun to listen to but taking a few bars of the original song repeating it over and over and over adding a dance beat various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece i think she would 've been better off either following a similar chord progression to gimme gimme gimme or just doing a cover perhaps benny and bj rn should 've stuck to their strict no sampling rule here ! for some reason many of today 's dance pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance a good example of a radio friendly dance pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is acoustic alchemy 's so kylie on their american english album \( the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what 's going on you 'll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression \) now i'm not going to say hung up is a terrible song because everyone has their own taste but i'm sorry to say it just does n't do anything for me	24
1	i'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color i would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil this is a perfect neutral color i subtracted one star because iprefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush i think it looks more natural brenda christian makes a brow powder which i prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powderi can find sometimes i mix the two i start with the pencil and add a bit of powder all all it 's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils	24

0	as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes deficiencies in the book and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about for instance the claim on page 86 that \( cdata \) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong his description of schema element declarations \( pp 114 115 \) teaches that using globals refs is the only way to define complex elements and is inappropriate for his example he makes no mention of globals at all leaving the reader confused i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information	24

0	i bought this camera after my 3 year old broke my kodak z700 i loved my z700 even though it was only 4mp and did n't have a lot of the features the newer cameras have i figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to 6mp would be a no brainer but i was disappointed in 2 major areas first the lag time is so slow on the c653 when i took pictures of my kids i rarely got what i was expecting to see the smile or look that i saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures we experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference the other disappointing area was low light picture quality anything i shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit every background was grainy terrible using the low light settings fixed the problem but then your subject is blurry because you 're not in sports or kids mode anymore \( which we used all the time with the z700 for taking pics of the kids \) on my z700 \( which is only 150 now \) i could set it and forget it set it to action and it took perfect pics indoors or out moving or stationary that 's what i thought i was getting in the c653 but i was wrong i ended up returning the camera	24

1	anyone who 's a fan of the black isle games based on the infinity engine should enjoy this game they changed up the character creation a little so you seemingly have more control over your character 's strengths and weaknesses while iwdii does n't have the depth of torment or the npc interaction of the baldur 's gate series it still has a good story and a nice interface graphically it 's subpar to the nwn series but i think that might actually be a benefit as i found the 3d aspect of nwn to be a hinderence at times some tips for those interested 1 make a party of 4 characters they will level up faster and have less hang ups with the ai with 6 members i found i needed to start over and import them into a new game after the prologue because they were under powered and 2 of them always end up wandering off on me those problems are abated with only 4 characters 2 multiclassing is key having thief abilities is nice but you do n't really need more than 3 or 4 levels as rogue sink all the points into picking locks and traps multiclass into a ranger or mage you wo n't have to worry about armor hindering thief skills adding a few levels of fighter to cleric or barbarian helps learn more weapon skills and in the case of a cleric a boost to hp these are just a few ideas 3 for the warriors focus on only a couple differnt weapons make sure you have at least one of them blunt weapons as some foes are n't as vulnerable to the bladed variety also have at least 2 members competent with ranged weapons	24

0	i bought a copy of this magazine and initially enjoyed a great deal of it but ultimately found it distasteful it was graphically hyperactive which became distracting and irritating and there was something else that did n't seem quite right though at first i could n't identify just what that was eventually i realized that it was n't making a clear distinction between the editorial content and commerce \( items offered by companies advertizing in the magazine workshops sponsored by the magazine books sold by the publisher of the magazine \) eventually i figured out that the publisher was australian if rupert murdoch is any guide then this magazine is coming from a tradition that does n't respect boundaries between journalism and financial gain i ended up putting this magazine aside in distaste	24

1	discipleship journal does what many other christian magazines do not do it provides instruction and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ focused faith while others may talk about christianity dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture this is n't an evangelistic magazine like decision or an encouraging magazine per se like moody it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god 's word says it is not for the passive pew sitter this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays there is nothing watered down here it is published by navpress who like their counterparts the college ministry navigators know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian whether it is a discussion about satan 's favorite lies how to study a particular book of the bible or an explanation of what prayer is an is not dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid page and realize something new about our lord and his ways this is a great tool for two or three people to use together even a small group to go through the articles week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life i 've even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week 's class i fully recommend discipleship journal expect your faith to grow anthony trendleditor hungarianbookstore co	24

1	while these are n't waterproof they provide enough additional protection to give you a little more confidence in going out of the house in underwear so soft and a little more absorbent than the gerber ones they are n't as trim a fit as some of the other brands but my son really likes the roomy feel	24
0	i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here so i was upset when i watched this sad movie gary graham \( t v 's alien nation \) is a robot jox which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought ! the f x are not very good and the story is paper thin only the acting is good but it ca n't save this one from being just a let down skip it	24

0	i should have followed the advice of most of the reviewers here before i purchased this humidifer there was a large mineral buildup but that was the least of it worked fairly good for three months but then it stopped working one of the controls literally froze in place and the machine was unusable no way to fix it had to throw it away what a shame next time i will pay closer attention to what people write my advice by something other than a honeywell i have three packages of filters that i purchased separately another waste of money	24
1	i thought i would quit breastfeeding because my nipples were soo sore ! i saw my skin practically peel off my nipple when i started to breastfeed i placed the gelpads on and within two hours i could see the healing begin i tried olive oil nipple cream and did n't even want to try anything with lanolin because i read it was n't good to ingest and it did not help at all this is a great way to sooth nipples naturally just let your breast air dry with a little of the breast milk \( natural oils \) and then place the pads on the nipples they are life savers i think i only needed three pairs until my nipples were used to the rigors of breast feeding \( about 2 3 weeks \) don't give up ! try these first these work	24
0	this game has a 25 minute introduction or story square enix was really creative and the stories are so good ! however i do expect them to put something like skip intro cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories ! i however only get a game every five months so i am fine with that this is only a minor flaw another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears very annoying but again a minor flaw this game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again ! it get very boring after awhile you have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker this game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters there is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle 1 0 3 5 terrible3 6 5 bad5 1 6 5 average6 6 8 good8 1 9 great9 1 10 must buy excellent ! graphics 9 10 greatsound 9 10 some voice acting but greatfun 5 10 depends on how patient you are and how you react to battling the same monster over and over againaverage about 8my grade 7 goo	24

0	i got this puzzle for my three children \( age 5 4 and 2 \) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked it requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds so removing one means it does n't work the pieces are small enough that i was n't very worried about choking but why buy a toy which makes you worry \? we were really disappointed	24

1	i'm 19 years old and saw these at bloomingdales the other day and decided to buy them i took them home tried them on and i was absolutely amazed they are a bit of a low rise but that only adds to the flattery and i like my underwear that way there are a bunch of different sizes you can button the sling to and once you find the perfect fit you can hardly even feel that it 's there i give it a perfect score and i am definatley going to buy more of these	24
0	this seems like a great idea the food is held in a basket so that you do n't have to shove a skewer through the meat however the little bolts that hold down the clamp onto the rack are meant to be tightened by hand if you have a sizable chicken you cannot tighten these enough by hand i had the chicken fall out of the rack into the flames more than once then you have to tighten them with pliers but the metal is so soft that you can only do this 2 or 3 times and then the threads are stripped and the whole thing is useless ! again hand tighten chicken falls out tighten with pliers threads are stripped now i have to try to get replacement parts for the rotisserie from weber good luck	24
1	ms put office 2007 on a dvd rather than a cd so there is only one disk so they make the installation easier right off the bat unlike all previous versions of office you do not have to get into the details of what options you want in previous versions if you did n't make sure you installed all the features when you went to do a function that was n't installed you had to dig out your office disks and install the feature a huge pain but not anymore the installation is hands down the easiest of all versions of office you do n't have to tell it manually where to find your files you do n't have to manually put in your favorite buttons it 's all done for you yes it takes some getting use to the new layout of the functions but once you figure them out it is so nice and smooth this version is light years better than all previous versions the most impressive part of the installation is outlook 2007 in all previous versions you had to export and import all your files and contacts anyone who experienced this knows that it never went that smooth sometimes it was awful and you lost emails and contacts in the transfer and the time it took to do this was very painful this is not the case with outlook 2007 just load the program and it does all the transfers from your previous version of outlook you do n't have to do a thing and you 're up and running without missing a beat when the program is done loading you will be shocked how simple it is anything new has it 's growing pains to learn but once you do you will be very glad you made the change	24

0	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	24

0	i purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their tv 's to watch programs rather than listen to music reception was horrible ! ! ! while i was in the gym i tried just listening to the radio and could n't even get that to come in clear the only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies ! not impressed at all ! i will be returning this and maybe buy the 12 generic set instead	24
1	first of all i want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game it is really well done using superb graphics and animations you get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors it all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the wright brothers edison and even einstein and you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories your scientists and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage if you like business engines buildings science and physics you 'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game you also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world each one has different challenges it 's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary	24
1	dominions 2 is a fantastic leap into tbs on an epic scale huge gods battling for supremacy by any means possible genocide reckless magic and disregard for humanity to be the last god of the panthenon a steep learning curve especially for perfectionists it provides you with a simulation of fantasty combat as opposed to actual historical combat low end graphics are balanced with the fact there are so many of them along with additional abilities a must for those who love 4x and tbs games not for everyone and documentation that does not do the game justice it is hard to get into but if you can get past the quot i'm losing and i do n't know why ! quot feeling you will be well worth it	24

0	it takes indeed some real power to get so many five star reviews for such shallow writing this book is a very poor way of handling thw well known concept of paradigms and paradigm shifts if you are at all familiar with these concepts simply forget buying this book as \( just because you paid money for it \) you will naturally be inclined to read it and this will be a total waste of time and energy there are so many books on creativity innovative thinking and innovation look for them this is a book on nothing was it a busines book on business models \? was it a cookbook for personal development \? what was this for god 's sake apart from being an insult on iltelligence	24

1	like most of the reviewers i went into this book expecting the humor and absurdity of the website and it 's all there in it 's ridiculous glory however this book is almost like two books in one upon reading the footnotes a much deeper tale begins to unfold beyond the nonsensical ramblings of robert the book tells a tale of a lonely kid using ninjas as an escape from his sad life his parents hate him he has no friends and nobody else listens to him except his babysitter and faithful dog the further you read the more you begin to see the deeper story unfold however even while the story gets darker the humor remains creating an experience that is both hilarious and touching check this book out	24
0	i bought this bike \( in the mermaid ariel theme \) for my 2 year old daughter the manufactor 's age for this bike is 1 1 2 year and up this bike is awful the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike but the pedals are attached to the front wheel like a tricyle which make it impossible for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but he even has a hard time riding it its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt i would take it back ! it was a huge disappointment as a christmas gift whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals	24

1	this patio table was quite a bargain ! it arrived in good shape was incredibly easy to assemble and was a perfect match for the astonica chairs i had purchased the month before a definite value for the money	24
1	i read the reviews before i purchased this machine i know from experience that reviews are extremely subjective and often times people misuse the appliance or simply expect more than a machine is capable of so with this in mind i will put in my 2 cents i have had my machine for two months and i use it about 4 times a week on a 200 square foot vinyl kitchen floor that accomodates two adults a 4 year old and two dogs generally it works pretty well and is much more convenient than a regular mop and bucket you must remember that this is a low cost residential machine and as such will not replace the suction and scrubbing power of a serious vacuum and elbow grease the machine is set up to auto shut off if you move the machine quickly or drop it down low i agree with with the other writers about the poor suction capability but you must consider the overall design of the machine a powerful adjustable head machine that would pick up more than dog hair and dust would be cost prohibitive i see what hoover was trying to do with this machine they were trying to accomodate our scrubbing and vacuuming needs in one cost effective machine they gave it a good shot but for all of us clean freaks this machine does n't quite hit the mark the water cleaning solution section is in my humble opinion to small i run out of water quickly and i have a very small kitchen but the good news is that my kitchen is so small i can take three steps over to the sink and fill it up \) one more comment before i give my final review remember to follow the instructions and use only the kind of cleaners hoover recommends there 's a reason for this if you use regular household cleaners that cut crease you will damage your machine and it will most certainly leak and die ! the grease cutting agents in regular household cleaners and soaps strip the bearings and fry the gaskets so my final opinion is this if you have a relatively small space and need a daily quick scrub it 's a great time saver it 's a good overall cleaner if you need a quick vac up of dog hair scrub and mop any more heavy duty than that and you are back to the good old vacuum attachment mop and bucket routine if you are a cleanfreak like me you know that nothing replaces a good old fashioned hand and knees scrub no machine will ever leave you satisfied this machine was definately not made for heavy duty cleaning but for light daily use it 's great i am giving this machine 4 stars because i think it does what it was designed to do light cleaning i would have given it 5 stars if the cleaning solution bucket was larger and the cut off mechanism was a little more liberal and a little more suction power would have been nice when hoover finally comes up with a heavy duty scrubber with the suction power of a regular vacuum scrubbing power of my own elbow and ability to get into corners and baseboards i 'll be all over it ! until then i 'll settle for a daily scrub with this machine and a good hand scrub once a month	24
0	i got talked into buying this at the fresh boutique in las vegas first it 's very expensive 38 forgivable if it were outstanding it 's not even good the wand is n't well made and the product does clump on it and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them i have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best but to no avail the worst part is at the end of the day if i happen to rub my eyes it smears racoon eyes i 've been using physicians formula and revlon with the primer both are exponentially better and i could have purchased eight of them for the cost of supernova on the positive side it washes off easily and completely with soap and water	24
0	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet it seems that first years has discontinued the product at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website we searched for model 4290 the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer apparently they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued furthermore the site is full of broken image links the thermometer works well but without probe covers it 's not a good investment you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there find another product with covers available	24
1	the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised it has three nested work bowls the inner smallest one takes a special blade \( a smaller version of the standard processor blade \) it 's perfect for pulverizing mixing small quantities of things pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest 12 cup bowl a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box \( finally a way to keep everything together \) the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl it 's the kind with the rotating hub \( two hub sizes are included one for lemons and a larger one for oranges etc \) while it seems to work it 's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black decker but what the heck it 's worth trying the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it at first i was disappointed that there were n't any fancy front panel switch options but after thinking about it you only need the provided on off and pulse would i buy it again \? absolutely would i buy it again from amazon \? again absolutely the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised	24

1	saw the movie had to get the game ! \( i also have project zoo that was good too \) overall not bad but then again we love wallace gromit loved the fact a friend could join in at any time to help but you have to stay close though we found the camera engine was a tad of a pain like with two players the camera might get stuck in a wall blocking your view \( tunnels could be a problem \) but a quick fix we did was one player would exit play for a moment that would reset the camera then the other could rejoin it was a challenge to beat the game at 100 but my sister and i did just that ! got a brain wedgie finding all the rabbits but loved it just the same loved being free to roam about and explore try reading the little signs scattered about on walls ! they are cool ! will play it again addictive game fun to boot that from a thirty something yes i still play video games ! some say all the weird ones thank you nick park for allowing the games ! and making the movie	24
0	i got the baby alive hispanic doll for my daughter for christmas i opted for the hispanic doll becuase i thought my daughter would learn a bit of the two languages as we speak french primarily in our home i must have received a broken doll because our doll is nothing like the description she does not speak english at all you can press her bracelet a million times and no english and when she does speak her english is slurred and unintelligible we have contacted amazon several times and have had them decline a return after 2 months we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep very disappointing ! would not recommend at all ! ! ! the reason that this rating received one star is because my daughter loves her death even though she does nothing	24
0	i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower even though that 's possible the very last thing this product does is remove hair at least with the epilator head the shaving head works fairly well but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective	24
1	this knife is great for hard cheeses i can cut them without the slices crumbling to pieces it feels very comfortable and sturdy in my hand like my other global knife the blade has a serrated edge so you will not be able to sharpen it easily but if you only use it for cheese it should stay sharp for a long time this is another beautiful global knife	24

1	i have been using this drive for a few months now and have no complaints one of my laptops only has a usb 1 x port and it is incredibly slower for backups that has no reflection on this product but be ready for things to work slowly unless you have usb 2 x and do n't blame it on this drive	24
0	for 20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking jogging with a bonus pedometer the radio has no channel display and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial then a scan button when walking it loses the station occasionally luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial but if yours is n't this could be terribly annoying as for the pedometer it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when i was holding it perfectly still thus worthless i'm sending it back	24
0	like some of the other reviews i loved cool edit pro then adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2 0 i use this program often and tried to give it a chance no way around it it sucks now i am going to use sonar a much better product the only thing i like about 2 0 is that you can burn to a disc from audition that is the only reason why i gave it one star this is not a user friendly program	24

1	my old grill was well over due for replacement and so i started doing some research into a replacement my previous grill was a coleman and had lasted a good 10 years although the cooking quality had definately deteriorated i was going to purchase another cheapy grill but in my research i noticed something almost every weber owner rated their grill 5 star whereas the cheapies usually mustered three stars at best a little more research quickly pointed out why webers may not last any longer than the cheaper competitors but a 10 year old weber still cooks better than the cheap ones do when brand new i invested in the platinum c but have yet to use the side burner so i'm not sure how valuable that is i was delighted with the quality of the grill it was easy to assemble and the cooking quality is fantastic i purchased a weber griddle and i also have a pizza stone and with these two additions i cooked 8 meals in a row on my weber including bacon and eggs home made bread pizza and of course grilled steak	24
1	few magazines can match the new yorker 's high caliber of journalism fiction reviews and of course cartoons all written by some of the best writers in the land it makes mainstream magazines like time and us news look like high school newspapers but one word of caution if you 're the type of person that whines liberal bias at anything that you slightly disagree with then this is not the magazine for you	24
1	this thermometer has been very useful it registers the temperature quickly and the numbers are easy to read even with bi focals the cover becomes a handle so your fingers do n't get to close to the flame when grilling i would recommend it	24
0	i 'll put my opinion first so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character is there really such a thing as quot national character quot \? people are just too different too unpredictable how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you \? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do \? would every italian if they could write well have written the same book as mr barzini \? i seriously doubt it so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians after reading it i felt even more strongly that such books though possibly entertaining are a waste of time an informative book about unicorns but do they exist \? anthropologists have been concerned for many years in getting the quot inside view quot the view of a culture as seen by the person within it while barzini is indisputable italian he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there why they are as visitors see them or why they are not as foreigners may think this is not a successful gambit cultures are based on many general factors like history socio economic patterns religion family etc but the specific results are just that specific barzini covers many topics the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality the family vs the state italian modes of achieving success the north south split sicily and the mafia and last the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners but nothing really connects there are only superficial scattered impressions nothing very concrete to grasp the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history these sections were well written and interesting but his portrayal of italian quot character quot is fuzzy contradictory and ultimately unconvincing finally if you are a lover of lists you will thrill to this book because there is a list on nearly every single page myself i got pretty tired of those lists if you want to know something useful about italy read another book if you just want entertainment which might support any stereotypes you have about italians then this book could be for you	24
1	this is a chase movie a kind of film noir without the black and white here the ordinary man is jeff goldblum a guy so so unhappy with his mundane job and cheating wife that he spends his nights driving the la streets instead of sleeping one night he finds himself in the wrong place at the right time he interrupts the murder of a beautiful and mysterious michelle pfeifer and very shortly he finds himself her unwilling accomplice as both evade her ruthless pursuers she warns him right up front that she is quot one of the bad guys quot but he 's hooked the chase takes them to all of the quot mink lined sewers quot of after dark la and lets them encounter quirky and sometimes violent characters this movie plays like a mix of dark comedy and thriller it has a plot twist of sorts but does not end darkly the cameos will be interesting to film buffs but not to anyone else it 's goldblum pfeifer and the chase that drives this movie and thankfully the story though improbable strings tightly together and does not involve stupid car chases explosions or wanton killing in fact the violence is tame by today 's standards there 's the brief nudity seen in 80 's movies and occasional mild profanity a nice film to rent i bought it	24

1	i was unsure about this item in the store but took a gamble i cut 1 3 of the bar up and crumbled it and i was n't particularly impressed with the smell of it dry so i grabbed the rest and tossed it all in wow ! it was so silky and smooth against the skin i jumped out and grabbed my husband to join me ! with some nice classical music on in the background and a tahitian vanilla candle you 'll think your back in the womb all safe and warm the bubbles did n't last very long but it leaves the skin silky and comfortable with out a perfumey scent	24
0	i just saw this toy in parents magazine sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at target this week i ran to get it since my son is too short to use his hand me down red tricycle it looked like lots of fun in the picture however my son is too big for it ! i do n't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old no way ! if it were adjustable i'm sure he would have loved it but just like another reviewer stated it 's just like the other ride on toys we already own currently the scuttle bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store how disappointing	24

1	this film is about the battle in the ia drang valley in 1965 vietnam it begins in 1954 when a french patrol is attacked and defeated in a surprise ambush a prophecy for the future \? in one scene a wounded french soldier is killed was this truth or drama \? then in 1964 we see children in a car singing a tune based on sambre et meuse which dates to the napoleonic wars next we see a training camp where helicopters will be used in ground battles was n't this an adaption of a civilian model \? one scene shows officer 's wives discussing local conditions and the laundromat are the defective washing machines at the camp a symbol of failure \? one scene recalls custer 's last battle custer did not know the size of the enemy he assumed about 2 500 and not three times as many later we hear the intelligence officer admit they did not know the size of the enemy forces ominous \? the mechanized cavalry lands in their helicopters the soldiers start shooting some soldiers run after a lone enemy and are ambushed the battle erupts in fierce fighting two helicopters bring in needed ammunition back in the states telegrams arrive with bad news for the families were they delivered impersonally \? the battle continues with rising casualties on both sides air support arrives to drop napalm some lands too far from the enemy they expect another attack at dawn but the tide has turned the enemy faces defeat and withdraws the end of the battle shows a load of journalists arriving to take pictures and question the colonel after the seventh cavalry is withdrawn the vietnamese reclaim their land the colonel returns to his family in his land in 1964 general douglas macarthur advised lbj against getting into a land war in asia could this film have been created as a warning against a war in the middle east \? does it have a subtle anti war message \? it seems different from his earlier film based on the revolutionary war	24

0	i purchased this when i was due to have my second baby i thought peg perego products were supposed to be so great and they are always so much more expensive i do n't mind spending the if you get better but this is just a horrible stroller it does n't turn easily at all the wheels constantly get stuck there is one cup holder that is soooo small and does n't stay upright there is no room for any storage bags pocket book keys phone snack they trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow the seats are too tight and small they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep there is nothing i like about this at all it makes going out where ever not easy at all for the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this they should be ashamed i actually use my orignal cheap single stroller instead	24

1	i have played through fable and the lost chapters several times all in all this is a very fun game the classic rpg elements of leveling up buying or finding new and better weapons and armor choosing to focus on magic use or hack and slash and choosing to be good or evil are all included in fable the graphics are superb for its time and the voice acting is top notch in addition the storyline is quite good and is more complex than the average rpg 'save the world' tale i have heard some complaints of fable being too short but if you take all the quests and max out all levels the game length should be just fine \( unless you are expecting a 50 hours morrowind experience \) where fable loses some points is the controller setup the button configuration can be overwhelmingly complex so much so that finding yourself using an item you did not mean to use can be a frequent occurance in addition you may find yourself using magic at an inopportune time simply because you pressed the r trigger by mistake the bow aiming feature might pop on at a bad time \( like when you are being attacked by 4 creatures \) and while rotating the camera view the map pop up might fill your screen as you are in the midst of battle \( thus obscuring your view \) also fable does tend to have some save problems you may complete some quests and save and upon reloading the quests may have to be recompleted or worse may not have been saved and will not be offered again ! still these are rather minor complaints while fable really does n't live up to its advertising of being an all immersive rpg it is quite good and a blast to play if you like d d styled rpg 's if you like zelda games but wish they were more adult definitely check out fable	24

1	i first tried this granola when they had it at costco and since then i was hooked i was never a huge fan of granola to begin with i usually liked the taste but a lot of granolas were very hard and crunchy even when eaten with milk a lot of them were also either too sweet or not sweet enough so when i tried this granola it immediately blew away all my preconcieved notions involving granola this granola is what granola should be not too sweet and easily softened in milk the flavor is awesome i have since tried most of the other nature 's path granola flavors and they are all pretty good as well but i think i still like this one the best also this one has omega 3 in it which is good for you anyway this is definitely my favorite cereal and it must be if i'm going to the length of ordering it on the internet ! i just ordered my second 6 pack and i do n't think i'm getting tired of it anytime soon	24

0	simply put jay z is incredibly overrated i own a couple of his cds but to be honest i never really liked him his beats never grabbed me and his lyrics never stunned me so much that i just had to go back and listen to a specific song again he mostly raps about drugs money and cars nothing special nothing new i'm just being real about it since everyone else is on his d ! ck i think the reason he 's so respected is because he blew up right after biggie died and he was the closest thing to him at the time granted jay z does use some good metaphors but for the most part his lyrics are shallow best tracks on this album ca n't knock the hustlebrooklyn 's finest w biggiedead president	24

1	i love this product and the rest of the pack it system beyond all reason i 've given them as gifts repeatedly in effect they give you drawers in your suitcase and sub drawers within the drawers of hotel dressers it 's easy to take out a pair of slacks without disarranging everything else the 18 folder works well for womens' shirts blouses and slacks i can easily fit say three pairs of slacks and two shirts into it if you want to carry more or fewer pieces it 's forgiving i use it for suit jackets too folding them in across the width of the folder i 've used mine often over perhaps 8 years and they still look like new a standard sized 21 roll aboard suitcase will neatly hold 1 18 inch folder \( this product \) two full sized pack it cubes a small pack it sac holding travel adapters and rechargers a toiletries bag \( not from this sytem \) and a pair of shoes \( squeezed \) it also works to omit the cubes and use two 18 folders depending on the clothes being packed	24

1	i did a lot of online and store researching before i bought this seat for my 3 1 2 year old son my one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children well now i can say it works well for slim ones as well he loves the arm rests and the cup holder it is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary we liked it so much we are going to buy another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition	24

1	i have just finished reading quot the power of ethical management quot and i thought it was well written in the past few weeks i have read several other books on business ethics and this one is my favorite it is short and exact with great details on how to improve your corporation as well as yourself this book not only can be applied to the work place but in your life at home family friends and children this book has helped me greatly	24
1	i have read a number of good reviews of this dvd on this site especially the one written by dennis littrel i will thus only add a small personal impression i remember seeing this movie when it first came out and being troubled by the sight of the 'good guy' so disturbed and unsure of himself this is not what we were expected to see from western heroes also troubling was the possibility that the good guy somehow might not win also troubling was the involvement of the good guy with another woman in a way which could not be understood by a very young person if he had a fiancee then what was he doing with this elderly mexican woman \? i am only speaking about my own naivete of course i too as a young person was troubled by the ticking clock and the whole mood of anxiety this is to say that while i sensed somehow the movie is 'good' i could not because of the perplexity i felt enjoy it the good guy does not run he does stand up and alone face the bad guys his fiancee though she has principles of non violence when it comes down to it does the 'realistic and necessary thing' to save the one she loves a realistic moral hollywood drama and of course made haunting by the 'do not forsake me oh my darling' in the background	24
0	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	24
1	they are comfy and i am able to wear them for long periods of time where with some other metals i can not the thing is i have smaller ears than some people so the stones are a little big for my ears i think but other than that they are just fine	24
0	ahhhh what a great movie i cry at the end every time i remember when i was young and prayed for the safe return of the astronauts of apollo 13 however i am severely dissappointed with the widescreen dvd those who created it did not use the original film but chopped top and bottom from the fullscreen vhs version there are many instances when this is evident but the most glaring is the scene in the back yard of the lovell house after the walk on the moon when jim says quot i want to go back there quot when the scene opens he is cut off at mid thigh and you never see below his knees on the fullscreen vhs you can see his shoes when i buy the widescreen i want the whole movie not less than the fullscreen vhs tape bad bad bad bad bad buy the vhs	24
1	this is for all the folks who got the free or nearly free motorola v180 spend the money on this case to protect your phone ! i looked at many different cases in stores and online hoping to find something handsome but even more importantly really protective the v180 apparently has had a few comments on the home screen going ka plooky 'nuf said i needed a better grade clear interior protector for the screen and touchpad sydney harbour gets high marks on this feature not flimsy dull plastic but very clear quality stuff secondly the super soft matte black leather is a sweet fit nice and snug form fitting with no feel of strain or awkward stretching the cut outs are perfectly lined up too there is one for the speaker phone feature on the back \( not mentioned in the ads \) snap on the antenna loop and it gives the whole thing a very nice custom look and feel sure this might look like a lot of review for a simple product but if you 're like me and only allow a few little bits of finery in your life you try to make smart and carefully considered purchases be nice to yourself and your phone go with sydney harbour and avoid the cheaper stuff	24

1	what i find so amusing from some of the one star reviews is the assertion that mr moore used creative editing of this movie to somehow distort the facts and therefore the entire premise and basis of this documentary is null and void the man is not only making a video to entertain you \( and this is wildly entertaining in a factual and hilarious way \) but it also rests in an unarguable fact the closure of the gm plants in flint michigan and the devastating impact it brought with it whether or not you like they style of moore 's presentation it is witty backed by appropriately titled music and shows the almost incomprehensible response on the part of the city of flint at this loss of future revenue \( or more bluntly its threatened economic survival \) and in the joining the impact that corporate america can have on the lives of its citizens and the coldly calculated dollars and cents approach to the bottom line moore succeeds in showing the viewer how both work with each other as you often cannot have one without having both	24
0	this stuff tastes absolutely terrible ! steer clear and do n't be mislead by the texture review below yup the texture is great but it the taste makes you gag it definately is n't worth it	24
0	the movie is a about a guy who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that that 's pretty much the whole story well the idea is quite powerful but not new the characters are done in the comics style and very primitive the jokes are quite boring actually what is really amazing that it could 've been ok to watch as a family movie but a few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids too boring for adults not appropriate for kids too much moral for young crowd i ca n't really think who might like it	24
1	i use this 1gb card in my sony playstation portable and it is awesome ! the tranfer rate using the usb 2 0 cable to the psp is very good and i love having all that storage space for movies music and images i got the ultra ii because i had read that sandisk outperformed sony in speed tests and i have to agree the tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32mb sony card that came with the psp for an extra 5 10 i got the ultra ii that has a warranty and better performance i think it is well worth it	24
1	some of the reviews of this weather station looked pretty poor but i took a chance and bought it anyway overall i am very pleased and glad that i did n't take the reviews too seriously i found that the temperature accuracy seems to be fine i put the base unit external sensor a second extra sensor and my old radio shack digital thermometer all in the same location and within a half hour they were all within 1 degree of each other indicating to me that the temperature sensors are consistently acccurate i also had no problem with the lcd viewing angle it is adjustable and seems to have a wide viewing angle anyway so i have n't seen any need to adjust it one of my few complaints is that all external temperature sensors are shown on the display as outside temperature where in reality i would think it 's more likely that most users will place one sensor outside and any extra sensors beyond that would be indoors \( i could be wrong here \) at first i was concerned that the forecasting function would be 'confused' by seeing several outside temperature humidity readings that vary greatly but eventually i found one sentence in the manual that indicates only the first external sensor is used for weather forecasting so it 's a little confusing but works fine as long as you make sure that external sensor 1 is truly outside temperature another heads up is that the base unit is larger than i imagined and it looks pretty chunky sitting on my bathroom vanity so be sure and read the dimensions	24

1	before i begin there 's one thing you need to know i ca n't cook i have skills that ca n't be beaten when it comes to heating stuff in the microwave and i can use the toaster oven to uh toast things but that 's it no whipping up any fancy 30 minute meals for me which probably makes me the only person who ca n't cook who actually buys this magazine this should say a great deal about just how entertaining every day with rachael ray actually is of course as you might expect i like rachael ray it really would be weird for someone to buy this magazine if they did n't cook and they also hated rachael and i'm not that weird ! however although this is ostensibly a cooking centric magazine i 'd argue that it really reflects rachael 's attitude and personality her enthusiasm love of a wide variety of food and adventurous spirit shine through on every page by all reports rachael was very hands on in developing this magazine and it shows to those who ask why they need to read a rachael ray magazine since rachael is all over television these days \( most recently with her own syndicated daytime talk show \) chew on this rachael is n't taking over the world by accident she 's obviously doing something right to be dominating both the food network 's daily schedule and the bestseller lists \( for her ever increasing line of cookbooks \) people just ca n't get their fill of her ! so what exactly is her secret \? i think it boils down to these factors a combination of approachability and charisma which are key ingredients of superstardom \( think of talented yet friendly stars such as tom hanks or shakira \) add to that a dash of optimism mixed with a spirit of adventure as witnessed on my favorite ray show 40 a day in which she explores a new tourist destination each week trying to eat well on an insanely low budget but what about rachael ray in magazine form you 're wondering \? well in my opinion every day with rachael ray appeals to all tastes by brilliantly translating her unique appeal from the tv screen to the printed page as i mentioned earlier i probably wo n't be cooking anything from the many recipes included in each issue but i still like checking them out each recipe includes a picture of the finished product and the recipes have lots of variety and creativity yum o ! and some are so simple like sandwiches or salads that i get the feeling i might actually be able to attempt them if i really wanted to \( see \? rachael 's can do attitude even gets through to the kitchen incompetent ! \) the travel articles and the short pieces \( about a wide range of topics such as buying cheese making mistakes in the kitchen etc \) are also fun but as a rachael fan i especially enjoy the parts of the magazine written by or about rachael one nice feature is a q a in which readers can send in questions about rachael which she personally answers as someone who has participated in a lot of celebrity q a 's online in the past i love these chances to get to know more about someone famous who you may never meet in person in fact the only reason i have n't rated every day with rachael ray five stars is because i 'd like to see even more rachael related photos and articles in each issue how cool would that be \? ! also i'm hungry for more interactivity perhaps some food themed sudoku or some search a words but to be fair this is a relatively new magazine and all great magazines need time to sort out what does and does n't work and so far every day with rachael ray has hit the ground running and is off to a great start i was actually the first person to buy the very first issue at my local bookstore when it came out \( i got lucky and happened to be there as they set up the display \) and i 've looked forward to each new issue ever since that day if you like rachael ray you ca n't go wrong here start spending every day with rachael ray and take a bite outta life even if you ca n't boil water !	24
0	had to switch bands standard band had patent leather look to it scratched from day one i ca n't understand why a 150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face i 've had 50 nike watches that were scratch proof after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking	24
0	after seeing both peyton place and the sequel i can tell you that i could tolerate the recast carol lynley and tuesday weld were wonderful in their perspective parts but i have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well \? my reasons for asking the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie over and over in this film it is stated that selena was raped when she was thirteen yet in the original film selena alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school also she looked pretty mature for thirteen then there 's selen'as boyfriend \( whose name escapes me at the moment \) in the original film he stood by her through the murder charges the revelation of the rape and the miscarriage yet in the sequel i'm suppose to buy that he could n't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of selena yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast \? i have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door it was all too obvious that the original film was n't taken into account when writing the sequel not credible at all	24
0	i ca n't believe anyone would give this stroller a good review we have 10m twins and have been using the stroller for about 4 5 months it 's terrible problems 1 no sun protection the visors are locked in place unless the sun is directly overhead or at your back it will be beating in your babies' eyes and you 'll need to buy a non peg perego sunshade accessory 2 hard to steer it gets stuck going across the lawn and on compacted dirt if the sidewalk buckles just an inch \( common from tree roots \) the stroller is stopped dead in its tracks it 's hard to steer in a straight line so it 's easy to get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks 3 it's flimsy the bottom of the storage area underneath stretched and sagged after a month of use it now drags on the ground and rubs against the wheels even when nothing is in it the cupholder broke during the first week 4 hard to unfold it takes two hands to unfold and you have to give it a vigorous shake to get it to completely unfold and snap into position do n't even think about about trying to set it up with a baby in your hands you need both hands free to deal with this thing 5 bad customer support the stroller comes with no weight height age suggestions when we first tried to put our twins in it they were swimming in it and could n't be upright when we called peg perego and asked how big the kids should be to use it safely the support rep said do n't know yes it 's lightweight and folds up nicely but the light weight is actually a drawback it means the handle and legs are flimsy and wobbly resulting in a stroller that 's difficult to steer my advice would be to seriously consider jogging strollers even if you are n't an active parent i'm not get something sturdy with big wheels to get you over the dips and bumps and cracks and patches of sand dirt and grass that you will encounter if stroller size is the most important factor to you look at stadium seating strollers	24

0	as star wars kits go it 's better than most ertl should have spent more time on the molds and getting the details right the kit while having very few parts is not a novice kit it has fit issues and badly 65279 mis aligned parts the upper and lower fuselages do not mate well and the solar panels do not align well with the hull the solar panels tend to cant to the rear not setting in line with the fuse it 's a case of both of the parts the solar panels and the fuselage being out of alinement much work is needed to get the solar panels to aline with the hull and the mounting pylons one bright spot is the well defined engraved panel lines and the small details the upper hatch and cockpit glass is the clearest of the star wars kits i have built it 's better than the x wing and other fighters and is as good in the detail department as the at at having not built the rare tie fighter kit i cannot say how it rate against it once the fit problems are dealt with and a good paint job is applied it makes a good display but it requires some modeling experience to get it to look as it should the stand is not sturdy enough for the weight of the model i suggest a clear plastic rod and a wooden base	24

1	lipstick going this review is for the guava stain shade i first bought this lipstick i believe in the mid to late eighties i was delighted with it then and am now it is sheer light non greasy and the color never changes the color is not neutral but i find that i can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade i wear i would buy different brands different shades and wear them maybe once then back to guava stain it along with clinque 's soft pressed blush in new clover orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites and the one 's i reach for time and again they are my dependables daytime wear for sure not night this is a subtle sheer color	24

0	i purchased this toy for a friend 's dog a while back the dog loved it he played with it non stop \( quack ! quack ! \) when he finally destroyed it though we were shocked inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag my friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items we did complain to the manufacturer who said they 'd look into it but i would still be wary of this toy i think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it 's toys but does n't rip them to shreds ! there is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe !	24
0	our grandson is barely four years and of average size for his age yet the batmobile is much too small for him for a kid who loves batman it is intriguing and he did try to use it as he pretended to be the batman of his imagination but after just 2 or 3 days he gave up and returned to his tricycle as a result except for the initial 2 or 3 days of limited pleasure he got out of it the batmobile has been a waste of money on the other hand for a child of 3 it should be fun i think for at least awhile	24

0	even though amanda is quite attractive the camera work is bad the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga dvd a bitter disappointment there are few close ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window a bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better if you are looking for an accidentally soft focus dvd of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost this is for you	24
0	i purchased this seat because of the safety factor that consumer reports reported on in comparing the seat to graco snugride however i am very disappointed on the tough very dense foam on the low back sacral region of the seat the foam goes down to a certain point on baby 's low back and then disappears leaving a dip for baby 's buttocks just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low back region \( with buttocks not supported \) not comfortable i wonder how a baby 's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat well i'm not going to take any chances baby trend should have consulted a physical therapist \( like me \) before designing this seat	24

0	does the unit work \? \? well yes to a degree it takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances the display is poor and though they say up to 40 objects per hole there is normally 2 4 objects per hole all this depends upon the skycaddie course recorder the user \( you \) can not modify the course or add any objects that the course recorder did n't think was important now the bad part the unit attaches via button and belt clip \( like a cell phone \) my button \( part that attaches to main unit \) has died twice in the first 30 days when it breaks again which it will often the unit will probally hit the dirt this is n't good but fear not it will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with skygolf and another week to get a replacement button \( which has been modified even weaker than the original one \) now my replacement broke on the first time i clipped it to the belt now back to skycaddie to get another after being on hold for another hour they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts this will take another hour you then get a message to leave a message normally within a week someone will call you back by normally i mean about 35 of the time you leave messages they return them would i buy another duh no	24
0	i bought this for my baby who at 6 months was barely 16 lbs she did n't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old so she was rear facing for a long time she loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well i could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and i could n't see my baby again the water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it we ca n't find any leaks but there 's little water the little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday it never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part while it was fun to kick at was just worthless my sister in law wanted one for my niece but i am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this	24

0	if the girls in this film were considered hot back in 1979 then i'm glad i was still in preschool some unattractive women not college age girls but actual 30 year old women who cannot get into the popular pi sorority start their own sorority called h o t s which stands for help out the seals and sadly their pet seal was the best part of the movie the goal of the h o t s girls is to steal all the guys away from pi house so they throw wild parties jump topless out of a airplane \( too bad the camera was on the ground \) fly a hot air balloon over the pi house to launch pies on the pi girls as they sunbathe topless etc the script seems to have been written by a 12 year old which is n't a bad thing i liked the fast paced wackiness of it all and the frequent topless scenes were nice unfortunately i did n't find any of the girls even remotely attractive if this film was remade today with the same amount of nudity and with nikki ziering brittany daniel shannon elizabeth and jenna jameson as the four main h o t s girls and maybe catherine bell as the house mom it would gross over 800 million in dvd sales i also agree with one of the previous reviewers who complained about the lack of rear shots how rude	24

1	my 2 year old is really active and my point and shoot camera cannot keep up with him and i also do n't like the washout look when i uses flash so i researched about which slr will best meet my needs mainly catching fast action candid moments and low light photos without flash the canon 30d comes up top on the list it has the best high iso performance in its class \( better than nikon and sony \) and when i combine the 30d with the fast zoom lens ef s 17 55 mm f 2 8 is the result is amazing i can stop any action in daylight capture every candid expression of my 2 yr old with the fast burst mode and take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod portraits are also excellent with sharp image and beautifully blurred background \( bokeh \) even the dimly lit decors of the disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there for the halloween party at night without flash or tripod this is really an important factor for me to buy this camera as taking pictures with a tripod is not an option when your subject is an active 2 yr old but you will need a good lens to make this work well if you use a cheap kit lens then it will probably not matter which camera you pick remember that these 3 are all very good cameras and the small differences in image quality you see in reviews are apparent only when they use the best prime lens \( not the kit lens \) and crop the pictures to magnify the details the sony is a very good choice if you are on a budget and do n't need low light performance \( use flash and save money \) the nikon has more custom function than canon and it is really as good as canon they both have their strength and weakness canon just happens to have slightly better high iso performance and that suits my need better than nikon to be fair i should mention that the nikon d200 tops most reviews as the camera of the year beating the canon 30d overall but the d200 is a bit too advanced for an amateur like me better suits someone more serious about photography the d80 is like a mini d200 but slower so it really boils down to what you really need and how much you want to spend shooting in low light without flash will need good high iso performance a good fast lens \( with wide aperture usually expensive \) and image stabilization if that 's what you want the canon 30d with the ef s 17 55 mm f 2 8 is will not disappoint you	24
0	i did n't know why i chose to read this book anyway it was disappointing really the book was slow and it was too long for a story of its type i mean i think the book could go on without some of the parts when i was reading it i only thought of putting it down because it 's making me go crazy i thought the plot was shallow but taylor 's self conflict was even shallower he kept on blaming himself about his father 's death well then it 's really his fault ! he was a coward if you do n't believe me go on and read about it although you might get bored getting to that part because it 's towards the end and i hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with denise he was acting really immature ! he should have at least thought about denise but he was too selfish it really sucked and yes i know that this is supposed to be a romance novel but i kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book and what did i find \? nothing oh what a waste it 's like sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader it did n't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like if it had n't been for my hrr \( home reading report \) i would n't have finished reading this at all i guess i'm saying this because i'm not into this genre love stories are fine but this one nah	24

1	alfred hitchcock 's second film after being brought to america by david o selznick was suspicion which he made while on loan to rko pictures as in his first hollywood flick rebecca he put joan fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star fontaine won the best actress academy award for her portrayal of lina mclaidlaw a bookish and innocent \( but wealthy \) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish johnnie aysgarth \( cary grant \) after their quick courtship and marriage against her father 's wishes lina begins to see johnnie for who he really is a penniless leech but she naively continues to love him nonetheless johnnie 's charm is ostensible yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable lina 's trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture the movie 's only flaw is its tacked on and seemingly contrived final scene which we are told was due either to mr grant 's popularity during these years or to the existence of the production code in effect in hollywood at that time hitchcock wanted a darker ending but as we see here he lost that battle however he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe the ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities suspicion is classic hitchcock grant and fontaine turn in masterful performances and nigel bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable beaky johnnie 's old chum the flawed ending prevents placing suspicion at the top of any list of hitchcock 's achievements but it is a fine film nevertheless and i can only give it my highest recommendation jeremy w forstad	24

1	i 've been a fan of the prince of persia series since i was a little kid pop 1 was great pop 2 was absolutely unreal pop 3d was ehhh but then two years ago along came a game that changed everything prince of persia the sands of time the first game in this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone 's breath away the gameplay was original flawless and beautiful the storyline sucked you in and did n't let you go even after you 'd beaten it 6 times over it was a flawless game last year the first sequel prince of persia warrior within was released while the game contained improvements in the quality of the graphics and the freeform fighting techniques the game was less pleasing to both critics and gamers ubisoft had turned the humrous witty intelligent prince from sands into an angry nu metal rocking humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent on ruining everyone 's time while the story was equally as engaging as sands warrior failed because it simply was not as much fun to play luckily ubisoft saved the best for last the two thrones is easily one of the greatest games i have ever played in concluding one of the greatet videogame trilogies ever created ubisoft have developed a near flawless game it is as though they took the strengths from both games removed the weaknesses of the second game and created a thing of pure brilliance the two thrones contains all of the witty punning elements from the first game and mixes them with the exciting more violent elements from the second game while removing everying that ruined the prince 's demeanor in the second game the original fun saracastic prince is back and largely because ubisoft has also brought back one of the things that made sands so great farrah farrah is the perfect foil to our hero she adds humor power creativity and definitely a sexiness to the game that warrior was lacking farrah 's relationship with the prince is by far my favorite relationship i 've ever played in a videogame and ubisoft deserves big brownie points for bringing her back the gameplay in the two thrones is amazing throughout the game the gamer is occassionally forced to play as the dark prince as there are situations where the normal original prince is unable to get through in other games playing as two characters often appeared more of a gimmick than an actual integral part of the story but in the two thrones the reasoning behind the prince 's frequent changing from prince to dark prince and back again is very well explained and very important to the overall story that two thrones is telling the fight scenes are epicly fun to play this prince has more moves than he had in the two last games combined and his battle techniques are a joy to use the new speed kill method of killing some opponents adds a certain amount of skill and brutality to many fights that otherwise would have seemed boring and taken far too long to complete i welcomed the addition of the speed kills once i fully learned how to use them the prince still moves as acrobatically as ever there is still wall running jumping flipping handsprings etc the only real notable movement difference is when the gamer plays as the dark prince the dark prince 's chain weapon thing can be used to grab onto bars that are are away or objects that would otherwise be out of reach and the prince can then swing over to them it 's not that different from anything the prince has done before but it was definitely fun to do and worked well with the flow of the game all in all i rate this the best of the new sands pop trilogy it 's an awesome game that should be played by anyone who has ever enjoyed a 3rd person adventure game if you have n't played either one of the first two games be warned the storyline is actually rather complex and you will be missing much of the story if you have n't played the first two games if you have played the first two games this story is a terrific conclusion to the prince 's tale and the way it wraps around back to the beginning of the trilogy floored me when i finished it buy this game \( something worth noting after you beat the game you unlock many videos chief among these is the alternate real ending to warrior within that was formerly only available if you beat warrior after collecting all the life upgrades so if you beat warrior without all the life upgrades and did n't see the real ending beating this game shows it to you in the video collection \)	24

0	upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer the digital camera still works great the printer is another matter while this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes as we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink replacing every cartridge at once will run you about 75 at a time give or take a few the gray ink is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first 50 70 pictures after that the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register very frustrating when you 're printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to in the long run i will not be buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing quality wise it gets you in the beginning but does n't hold out for the long run we have fiddled with it for two years enough 's enough	24
1	the shoes are not exactly what i wanted bacause i was trying to get the same shoe that i had purchased some years ago times change and so does style i searched everywhere and these were the closest to what i wanted the keds shoes from amazon which i ordered and received on time might i add were more like what we used to call bo bos and the rhyme used to go like this bo bos they make your feet feel fine bo bos they cost a dollar 99 bo bos do n't know who made it up even but that was the rhyme we used to sing i ca n't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference i still like the older ones better not sure if i 'll ever find the same ones again oh and one last thing if i could give shoe and clothing stores one tip it would be to make adult sizes for the children 's items they make some really cool things for kids today like the keds girls' jazzy sneaker hope it 's not just because i have n't grown up yet	24

0	it is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here i'm disappointed by that as i paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews i'm old enough to remember old time licorice that was sold for 1 cent \( even 5 for a penny \) and that is the flavor and consistancy that i was looking forward to when i purchased this licorice i have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking and i just tasted it to make sure that i did n't have my spices mixed up based on that comparison my verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise \( not licorice \) i thought it was much too soft there was no chew to it it was mushy the only thing i can think to compare it with is a soft cheese such as havarti it is even softer than a mild chedder sorry only 2 stars from me	24
1	this is a great buy if you are just wanting to have some fun with no real investment although it does go beyond 17 feet and that is not as far as you may think but i used it while snorkeling and the pictures turned out great and i am sure a few were more than 17 feet	24

1	i had been on the look out for a mary jane pump that i could wear to work with pants and skirts i finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try usually steve madden 's run big on me so i got a size smaller and surprisingly it was actually too small a half size up did the trick however i love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet they 're also very comfortable for a high heeled shoe my only complaint is that the show is actually very deep on the top and there 's quite a bit of toe cleavage i guess this is n't necessarily a bad thing it just did n't look like that at all in the picture also the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low and if you have wide feet it could make your feet look even wider \( or fatter \) despite those two small flaws i really like this shoe and find that i can wear it with almost anything \( they look especially cute with skirts \)	24

1	this book provides a fine introduction to the myths of northern europe the book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose written by christian writers after the fact the eddas beowulf and the viking sagas from these sources especially the edda the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the norse gods and their subsequent twilight in ragnarok then the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the northern european peoples the figures of odin thor loki balder and the rest of the norse gods play an important part in our european cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of ragnarok \( the twilight of the gods \) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the christian worldview whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand northern europe in pre christian times finally it must be noted that in many ways at least in my opinion the society of the vikings was superior to our own i admire the strong sense of individualism that the vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats	24

1	this magazine is ideal reading for anyone who demands a broad perspective and deep analysis about any current topics related to international foreign policy years ago i subscribed to the magazine and now as an international relations grad student i use articles in the national interest to address my areas of concentration the pieces are useful to me because they are so in depth i appreciate the pragmatic approach of the writers as well as the wealth of information the editors ensure are featured in each issue i particularly like the reporter at large feature and the recent conversation with henry kissinger segment top level experts on foreign policy like diplomats and intelligence officers well known policy makers and prestigious journalists make the national interest an exciting read the broad and varied views enhance my studies i like the magazine because the centrist perspectives distinguish this magazine from the many others i read like the economist foreign affairs and foreign policy i find that every article offers level headed reasoning no sound bites no bumper sticker clich s the articles offer conclusions that allow me to develop my own informed opinions for anyone who wants to be up to date about foreign policy and who wants to develop well documented opinions from those who have been on the front lines of world affairs this is the magazine i recommend without reservation 2nd year graduate student at the yale university mcmillan center of international studies	24

1	tazo 's china green tips green tea is a slightly stronger green tea than tazo 's zen and i liked that it does n't contain tazo 's omnipresent natural flavors that almost all of their other teas contain which to me is not an advantage i like a natural real taste with real ingredients sans vague natural flavors and sans flavorings sans essences etc china green tips delivers this in a cleaner purer way than tazo 's other teas i liked this green tea ! the ingredients in china green tips are simply spring harvested green teas from china it contains caffeine tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea china green tips has none of these natural flavors and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience on the paper tea packet tazo writes a traditional chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor this is the perfect way to describe this tea ! on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of china green tips as grassy vegetative sweet ricey tazo describes the aroma as vegetative popcorn i would rate this tea and tazo in general as very good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi or aspen still this tea is excellent so i'm breaking my tradition with tazo teas and giving it five stars if you enjoy super premium teas and are stuck with tazo for some reason choose china green tips and you will be quite satisfied i ca n't honestly say that about any other tazo tea	24

0	i bought this monopod about 3 weeks ago after reading the reviews here i'm not sure if i got a defective unit but i 've had these problems from the gitgo i noticed the 2 lower sections will not open and close smoothly they would get stuck about 2 3 inches from the lock and you 'd need force to expand retract them very interestingly if the section right above the one i'm trying to expand retract is unlocked then the operation is smooth and flawless ! the ballhead does not support my nikon d80 and lightest lens \( 18 55mm \) a less than 2 lbs combo which is much lighter than the 4 4 lbs weight limit indicated in the specs the camera just slumps in one direction or another regardless of how hard i try to make sure the ballhead is locked tightly again it might have been a defective unit but i thought i 'd point my observations out anyway i wanted to buy this from amazon it was n't in stock it was sitting in my shopping cart and when it became available amazon bumped the price to 40 so i went elsewhere and got it for 30	24

0	i am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent ! ! as for me i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay the fault in order of importance poor screenplay poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino who seems to be vying for the most over the top performance the film was absurd in many ways from the outset the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans close up after close up conveying no meaning pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his not so famous european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops first example they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that then instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling police you 're under arrest they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source of course pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog stumbling around further pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from we must assume his quarry did the screen writer forget that pacino 's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit too \? inevitably and apparently not because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him as i watched this scene unfold i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already that pacino has fired on and killed his partner it was then that i decided that i had had enough by the way the european version with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior do n't waste your money or on line rental queue on this hollywood drivel ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time the recruit which i could only stand for about a half hour too	24

0	do n't expect a comedy in the vein of trinity or they call me trinity if you do you are in for a fall both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining this one has no such pretensions it is merely boring the story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town 's folk out of their claims they do this through intimidation and violence when a couple of friends get hold of a claim they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys to do this they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction they yell they fight they wrestle they shoot and then they do it some more its not very exciting cinema this production is made worse by the dvd i suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair the dvd however is of such low quality that who could really tell \? the edges are clipped off the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it it was not worth the effort spaghetti westerns can be fun this one however needs the pepto bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn	24
1	i did my research for the best stroller thus this one is the best in market travelling with my baby is much fun and easier i can carry fold and move it with no help its so easy to open and fold its very cozy my baby can sleep happily in it	24
1	at the end of the day when you come home from school or work one ca n't say quot i feel great quot rather than great we are stressed and tired the sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this cd captures it it almost perfectly i too am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain and it does work it would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping with quiet natural sounds it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you	24
0	i only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places i would say that the ball 's tension would fall under the easy category i 'd recommend the power web over this product	24
0	donot buy it i got the stuff even past the expiration day	24
1	i got a good deal on this and it turned out to much better than expected well made with a sharp edge that holds up the only reason for a 4 is the handle is not the most comfortable or secure grip	24
0	if you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what 's really going on in the world read this magazine national review is for people who sympathize with christian jihadists and white supremacists would n't want to be in that camp if i were you read time mother jones the nation or the american prospect instead	24

0	this was a total waste of money it 's a real cheapo like something out of a cracker jack box	24
0	i only wish i could return this camera its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants \( what i do most \) and its manual focus is difficult \( very difficult \) to use my much cheaper and lower resolution old minolta does a much better job in low light conditions i find i have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus in addition photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so called high speed memory card do n't buy this camera	24
0	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard and i 've thrown most of them out already it does n't take much to crush them there are much nicer sets out there and there are separate pieces sold on ebay that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better not worth the money	24
1	remember when the dawn of 24 7 cable news networks seemed to be a godsend \? now we know that that led to 24 7 garbage \( breaking news now means a peek at the food menu served to the self confessed and deluded killer of jonbenet ramsay the elevation of trivia to news status to fill time on a slow news day the absence of any sort of perspective or background the application of insane levels of urgency to minor health scares endless celebrity gossip etc \) i had enough of this nonsense all i wanted was a brief summary of what was important with some context thrown in all the truly significant news can be relayed in a brief period of time the rest is junk meant to fill in the time between commercials more time spent on news does not mean being better informed because 24 7 news is simply obsession with the same few stories repeated ad nauseum i tried the christian science monitor they have excellent standards but it is expensive to get every day i then tried this publication it met my needs you get a complete summary of everything that was important in the previous week 's news with a minimum amount of fluff celebrities are lucky to get a paragraph if anything in the entire issue you come away from this magazine \( easily read in an hour \) with a great overview of all that mattered in the previous week international and world stories get much more coverage than what you see on cnn fox or your local paper there does n't seem to be any bias that i could detect get this if you want to decrease your time spent on news but still be well informed move over you stodgy time and newsweek magazines	24
1	i have used the camera for three months and absolutely love it ! the pictures are crisp \( even very close ups \) and the video feature is right up there sound pick up is excellent i have created two dvd 's combining videos and still pictures folks have thought the quality was very good the battery life was rated very good and i have found this to be true i carry the camera with me nearly everywhere i go people are impressed with the size drawbacks \? because of its size there are no connections from the camera to a computer tv or battery charger the docking station is small and lightweight because of the battery life i have never been away from home long enough to need recharging i recommend the camera without reservations and will look first to casio in the future	24
0	the pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic my daughter 's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse after asking santa for a cinderella castle she was a bit disappointed this playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it	24
1	note this product will only work on walls with wood studs no metal studs see the sanus website for installation manual and more details	24
0	give me a break people ! all spin magazine is a cheap rip off wanna be of alternative press i 've looked at like maybe ten or less issues of this waste of printed material in the past as many years think i may 've saved one of those issues sometimes i 'll find an issue left by an uninterested patron at the post office that 's been left behind i 'll then take it home then likely toss it out after i 've looked through it twice avoid at all costs	24
1	this is a good toy for a toddler not a baby i 've used this toy in two different setting \( first as a nanny and then as a mom \) and both times the babies were terrified of it it 's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old the balls fly everywhere and you 've got to run about after them to keep it going unless of course you 've got a toddler then they can run about after the balls \( which seems to be half the fun for them \) good toy but not until maybe 14 months	24
1	this album is a great representation of what spoon is about great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind the two sides of monsieur valentine sister jack and i turn my camera on i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock definately money well spent	24

1	this is a highly informative and accurate book it presents the data in a clear and graphic form with a minimum of statistical manipulation the studies cited by the previous reviewer lloyd rowsey are based on econometric modeling since the one he mentions two other econometric models of abortion and homicide have been published with opposite results one is by ted joyce the other by john lott and john whitney econometric modeling can prove anything if you want to understand crime in america in the 1990s buy the crime drop	24
0	i ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons they were unable to inflate either soccer ball on christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked if there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit i would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready i had to go out and buy new needles the day after christmas we 'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump	24

1	i loved the core knowledge curriculum the reason i switched my children to a charter school is that they started out teaching ck i also switched them back to the public school when the principal got away from ck and made it just like a public school i agree that a teacher should supplement what is in the ck books to give their students a better understanding of the material teaching the information exactly how it is presented in the books would be very dry however ck is a great outline of what should be taught it covers a tremendous amount of knowledge including the fight for civil rights all religious ideology multicultural literature and more if there is a problem with the books it is that many children would not be motivated to learn the wide variety of topics covered for many it would be too much also weak teachers would be overwhelmed trying to cover everything hence anyone claiming that ck supports a racist philosophy has never read the books also i want to point out that the reviewer who called the books racist misspelled the word it is not spelled rasist i also find it disturbing that the reviewer is supposedly a teacher when attending school maybe that teacher would have benefited from a core knowledge foundation	24
0	i wo n't go into a long diatribe suffice it to say that when i listened to this upon its release earlier this year i was disappointed i gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great this is more a photo of dylan as a free spirit there 's a point where baez messes up a song \( i do n't have anything against baez that being said i do n't have much for her either \) there 's joking and laughing but really i do n't need a double disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he 'd rather be in the audience than performing you can almost sense why dylan went electric in this concert the bootlegs prior to this are superior and i would suggest that if you are n't a die hard dylan fan to stick with them if you really like dylan 's acoustic work and not his electric stuff you should be pleased with this double disc i love dylan but not enough to enjoy this over and over again i 'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix	24
1	i have used these for years and when i run out my skin knows and shows the difference i have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather cold or hot i carry these in my purse and have them stashed all over the house misting my face many times a day voila clear and moisterized skin ! they really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin and they keep mine from being red and itchy which makes me very happy	24

1	well i'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on he 's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed but orthopedic giant dog beds started at over 200 we got the idea to try a baby crib mattress and ordered it very soon thereafter i arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable he loves it it is well crafted and everything the ad said our use is quite unconventional but it works well and we could highly recommnend this for anybody with a large dog	24
0	warning movie spoiler below ! ! ! i confess that my primary reason for buying a copy of this film is grounded in recent history i was around in the early 80s when l ron hubbard and his scientologists were going full bore with the logistics of making the book into a movie \( the hero depicted on the original edition of the paperback looked like chuck norris or so i thought \) when all of a sudden hubbard died and the whole project apparently fell apart back then i was close to 20 years old and i was curious about whatever it was that these scientologists were turned on to that was supposed to help improve a person 's quality of life then i read about larry wollersheim 's 1985 lawsuit you can figure the rest out for yourself anyhow oh yeah the movie the storyline is your basic alien invasion number i e the invaders arrived to make life miserable for the poor humans \( in this film the aliens look a lot like the klingons from star trek \) until your typical dashing young male hero organizes a band of his fellow humans to rise up and tell the invaders to get off of our planet pretty simple and straightforward but hey there are other films much worse than battlefield earth and they 've taught me that if you have good enough special effects even the lamest sci fi storylines can work ! the thing that stood out about this film though was its reliance on everyday talk and contemporary cliches for much of its dialogue and as a result it came across as rather corny a film to be recommended for its comedy value rather than for things like epic space battle scenes also the bad guy aliens use some sort of psychic power to interfere with the minds of their human subjects in order to keep them from organizing revolts i must say trying to depict mind manipulation effects on film does pretty much the same thing to the movie as varnish stripper does when applied to a cd it turns it into a confusing incomprehensible mess ! a couple of times the picture would break up into a concentric blur and i 'd wonder what the heck was supposed to be going on how the makers of this film ever talked a great studio like warner to help them film it is something which will forever remain a mystery to me i remember just before this picture opened a group of scientologists were trying to hype it oh watch this film is going to be bigger than star wars and gone with the wind combined ! you can guess what happened when those staggeringly huge box office numbers never materialized can you say oops	24
1	i 've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty gloppy mess i throw in it including shortening butter cream cheese sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine i spend less time cleaning up then i would have with glass as more is pushed out i have n't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version they both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are	24
1	i purchsed this watch a while ago and i have to say it is simply great the animated feature is simply the face switching between red and black which can be set to hold at either color which is a feature i have found to to very fuctional as it allows for me to switch to the color that better complitments what i am wearing i have had this watch for nearly a year and it still gets comlpiments weekly my only criticism comes from the fact that it is not like some of more of the trend watches that have a wide band that actually cuff around the entire wrist from which this watch takes its styling cues nevertheless it is still a great watch that looks good	24
0	after seeing the photo and reading the other reviews i thought this would be a good buy i'm not really thrilled about this jacket it 's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker it does n't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel this is something you can easily find at walmart on sale for 9 99	24
1	i was looking for the black and white deluxe version \( with expansion pack \) and came across this i was a little hesitant in purchasing it because one of the reviews \( by computer dude \) said none of the games have activation numbers let me start by saying that this is not true this is a little four page installation manual that tells how to install all four games \( really five including the black and white expansion pack \) and on the back were all five activation numbers i installed black and white without any problems and was up half the night playing it the only difference between these games and the originals is that all the documentation \( manuals etc \) except for the four page installation guide are on the game cds so if you are looking for a couple of these games this is a great deal and the information by computer dude claiming that their are no activation numbers was inaccurate	24
0	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television do n't bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd	24
0	this year instead of renewing my subscription to norton system works 2004 i thought would be a good idea to bring it up to date i purchased norton system works 2007 the 2004 version worked fine for several years while the 07 version could not be installed on my xp professional pc the norton consumer firewall worked perfectly they make it very hard to get effective help \( unless you want to pay them 9 95 per call \) several sessions on their complementary live chat system proved useless in the end efforts to resolve the problems simply wasted an otherwise perfectly good weekend i returned the product to norton for a refund their return procedures indicate that i will wait six weeks to get my money back just wonderful	24

1	robin williams is an afrs disc jockey in saigon during the vietnam war he is fast talking zany unconventional and a problem for his superiors williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten the movie is an exhausting experience to watch as it must have been for williams to perform it 's an amazing one man show but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty	24

1	here 's the deal i was looking for a good way to move the oil filter to a different place under the hood and this kit did the job perfectly the filter on my son 's car is on the side of the engine block \( nissan 240sx \) and located right above a section of the frame that has holes in the top every time i remove the filter the oil drains out of the filter and enevitably into the frame \( a big wad of shop rags or towels under the filter helps but not always \) then i 've got oil draining from the frame for the next week making a mess all over the driveway anyway the pump thing with the drain tube running from the pan is unique but not what i bought the kit for \( i only used the filter relocator \) was impressed with the quality of the fittings and the hoses and everything hooked up like they said it would the big plus though it 's about one third the cost of any other kit out there \( including those listed on amazon com \) and it comes with adapters to fit just about any car been on the car now for about 8 months with no problems and has made changing the filter sooooo much easier and cleaner in fact decided to buy another kit from amazon for my own car	24

0	i bought these for my 83 year old mom she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out we thought it would be a good deal for the price she was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived but as others have noted these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount \( almost 1 4 inch \) which makes them rather top heavy unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes these earrings are going to droop downwards not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect needless to say my moms ear lobes are very thin as soon as she put them in her ears they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle she was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund	24

1	rem has had a helluva lot of hits and has remained a radio staple and has been a big influence on later bands this 18 track album does a good job for its length but i really do feel a 2 cd hit package is warranted the biggest omissions are shiny happy people it 's the end of the world as we know it and this one goes out to the one i love it would n't surprise me if the band did n't really like these songs and would rather not include them in their greatest hits collection however there are a few other more minor hits i know from them that are missing like radio free europe i just ca n't think of other titles right now but there are more than a few other omissions too many of the minor hits that are included here thankfully are very good and will grow well on you the great beyond bad day all the way to reno e bow the letter and imitation of life are songs i have n't heard enough of and i'm glad they are on this collection still i hear rem is coming out with another compilation and i imagine it will be more complete i suggest waiting for that album when it comes out	24

1	my trusty ford escort experienced cold shock when moved from tx to pa in december it needed to be jump started the jump starter has been extremely easy and effective to use	24
0	the batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman but this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with you have to insert it just so to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son does n't always do it then i have to get a butter knife and pry it out so i can put it in for him for 10 dollars it 's worth it so long as your child does n't absolutely want a shooting batmobile ps my sister bought the same one for her son this christmas and is having the same problem so i do not think it is unique to mine	24
0	turbotax has what looks like it would be a geat feature the ability to import data from your financial institutions so that you do n't have to enter all of your stock sales by hand some of the cost basis \( how much i bought the shares for \) was empty so i had to go in and enter them manually no big deal just took a few minutes however when i went to e file the program had flagged these changes as overrides to computed values and refused to let me e file the return equally bad is that if i just leave the fields empty as they came from charles schwab then it looks like i got the stocks for free and have a huge tax bill \( that is incorrect \) so after many hours of trying to see if i could change the field so that it would not be flagged as an override i determined from other upset users of turbotax in the forums on intuit com that i was out of luck i 'd have to print it out and mail it in as a special reward turbotax does n't even tell you what attachments you need to include on the return that you are now forced to mail in the help screen says that what it prints out will tell you what to include in the return that 's wrong so the main reason i got turbotax was to e file now i get to print it out find out all of the crap that i have to attach to the return mail it in then wait for weeks to months to get my return thanks intuit ! ! ! ! the saddest part is that h r block had sent me a free copy of taxcut before i bought turbotax i should have used that before i spent 30 on a piece of crap like turbotax wo n't do that again	24
1	my son turned 4 on tuesday and i had bought this and was saving it as a birthday gift ! he absolutely loves it ! he has spent hours and hours of time already sitting and playing with this playset and his turtles even my husband thinks it 's cool ! it was n't too difficult to put together and it stays together quite nicely ! great toy for a 4 year old that loves tnmt	24
0	i got this bar based on the other reviews and boy is it strong ! the bar will last a very good long while unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon it was never supposed to be a stand alone perfume ! like all the lush bubble bars this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar \( and it is a very big bar \) and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong strong smell i think the upside is that it seems like the scent is n't nearly so strong once you 're actually in the bath or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just ca n't tell the difference anymore so yeah if you love love loooooooove patchouli then this is truly the bath bar for you otherwise i 'd steer clear and go for something gentler the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar in that it 's really gentle on the nose and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one i love lush but not this bar	24
0	the game disk does not run on my laptop but it will play it on my desktop computer very annoying but at least i can play \( other reviewers have not been so lucky \) the game has some good questions and i enjoy testing my friends knowledge the game itself is rather simple and not totally fun the game board is the outside of the friends' apartment building when you get a question right a window lights up when you get one wrong a window dims if you do n't answer the question nothing happens you win when all the windows on that floor are lit up i would prefer that they make you answer all questions none of this passing on a question it would up the ante and perhaps add some excitement if you play a multi player game you cannot select which letter is your buzzer and the letters assigned by the game designers are adjacent keys on the keyboard ! it 's silly for the two players to be huddled together hovering over the same part of the keyboard when the designers could have selected other letter keys set further apart there are some video clips and still images accompanying the questions but it 's mostly a trivia game without visual aids or embellishments think trivial pursuit with a computer screen as the cards this game was a gift if i had to do it over again i 'd probably spend my money instead on scene it ! friends edition as of right now scene it ! friends edition is on sale at circuit city for the same price as this game is on amazon \( and though i have n't played it the reviews of that game are much better than this one \)	24
1	this was the first queen album that i ever had so getting it on cd is great sheer heart attack is an overlooked queen gem	24
0	someone suggested i listen to this because i was at the time into what lame beret wearing record store dips would call creatively aggresive music then it was death metal \( which i prefer without cursing or filth you understand \) since then i 've found the ascension into gabber and then full on unmitigated hardcore anyway mr bungle tepid uninteresting bland stupid gives the chin strokers something to fascinate over let them someone 's got the fuel the economy	24
1	i am so sick of all the fragrances out there that smell like chocolate pie or cake why people want to smell like food puzzles me that 's why i was so glad to find a feminine floral scent with a little tease to it maybe baby is delightful not too heavy but making its presence known the complements will flow it 's sweet \( not too sweet though \) and innocent while at the same time being flirty if i had to pick a season it reminds me of it would be spring i ca n't describe a frangrance anymore than i can describe a wine but with all the stinkers out there i just had to put in a good word for this very wearable scent	24
0	while there are some flashes of brilliance in this album it is compromised by a lack of direction the 'tastes so sweet' mix of rapture is beautiful although cut far too short faithless afrika bambaataa amp soulsonic and crystal method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album the high point without contest is darude 's ripping mix of rising star 's 'touch me' this is a cut to throw on for the peak when you find the party is just outside of barstow with hunter that said then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album these are more appropriate in an adolescent brit girl 's drawer next to the spice girls for some labels this would be normal for ministry however it is a dissapointment	24
0	i 've ordered this item twice from amazon and both times all of the plastic jars were smashed inside the packing box	24
1	this cd has so much going on and going for it it 's one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans lee ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the 80 's and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks he 's never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right blue in green is one of my favorite jazz compositions by miles davis and ernie watts on tenor sax more than does it justice ocean ave is as breezy and beachy as i think it 's meant to be my favorite tracks are easily she walks this earth \( ivan lins' vocals are bossa nova beautiful \) blue in green and predictably for me papa was a rolling stone with powerful crystal clear unique trumpet by chris botti and soulful rhythmic vocals by kenya hathaway and grady harrell i went looking for that track because i am transfixed by chris botti 's trumpet and what i found was a remarkable cd in its entirety happy me	24
0	this product is not very good the speed registers at least 6 miles per hour faster than radar gun getting the grip on the ball correct to make it even register a speed is difficult and frustrating avoid this ball	24
1	product is just outstanding really deserves the 5 star rating it has in amazon my vehicle had tree sap mist all over its finish i tried many diffrent waxes even tried compond and nothing i was begining to lose hope until a little research on the net about clay bars and ran into this product it took me about 3hrs to do my entire car and although it was plenty of work i could not belive the result its a mirror finish the paint looks gorgeous highly reccomend this treatment	24
0	diana krall 's popularity is not hard to understand she 's easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice rich round and polished but that 's where the good news ends the selection of material and the narcoleptic bossa nova on the rocks arrangements combine to create a cd that is nothing less than a love song to darvon in fact inside industry sources maintain that the entire cd was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man the rule with standards is do n't do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair ms krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly cruel and unusual punishment considering it 's a wonder they 're still standing the resuscitation of popsicle toes is both the final insult and injury for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity how could she do this to us \? wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who are n't listening to each other much less the ambient audio wallpaper there will be a demand for music of this type the diana kralls of the world can always find work because for many smooth equals good walk do n't krall beyond this woozy soft focused world there is music that is real and really matters	24
0	i ordered a pair of black cotton mary janes and i had the same problem with the turpentine smell i was prepared for it because of reading other reviews and was willing to take my chances for the price i wonder if any of the other colors or fabrics had the same problem i washed them in vinegar water immediately after buying them and it helped some but they still stink i'm going to wrap them in a clear plastic bag to transport them on the plane and hope they do n't make my other clothes smell and i'm still going to wear them and hope nobody else can smell them	24
0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	24
0	i ordered this for fun and have since decided that it 's definitely not for me in any way it 's very drying on my skin even though it 's thick and creamy the label says it 's award winning but does n't state what award it 's received \( if any ! \) i fail to see what might warrant it being award winning the scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy also it 's absurdly priced given the quality i 've tried a few philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed	24
1	haribo 's has the best gummi candy i love the pink grapefruit but it is very hard to find unless you have acess to a candy store haribo has the best candy amazon has the best price	24
