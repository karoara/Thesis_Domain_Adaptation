0	i loved the look of the boot the price was great i guess you get what you pay for they run a size small there is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location you break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off believe me i tried i really wanted to keep the boots based on the look once on they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all i am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe i tend to be pretty easy i just could not make these work ! sorry	0

1	as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficultfor those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit inanything other than the most expensive brands these shoesare well made and an excellent value the only negativeis that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacerto make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit inmy particular case	0
0	they run much smaller than birkenstocks i sent the size 44 back \( which is comfy in the comparable model in birkenstocks is it the boston \? \) and got the 45 and it still feels small the upper is ok the shoe is n't the best made thing but is adequate it 's just the size thing that bothered me	0

0	broke within 12 hours of purchase very cumbersome and non flexible for different types of cars would n't recommend	0
0	i did n't pay much for these so i had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag they repel water from the outside just fine but they also keep it in they might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them but that is hard to do in a pinch go for it otherwise invest in something better i certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0

0	maybe just maybe someone will buy one of these stick up bulbs and maybe just maybe the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out i thought to myself buy another one because maybe this one was defective i bought three more every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use it 's a great idea but a worthless piece of junk the spare bulb \? useless as well do n't waste a dollar on this junk if i could have found the receipts i would have gotten my money back	0

1	i ordered this item and a pair of mocha nubuck as well i 've been wearing birks and various varieties of them for years i'm always very satisfied with the fit delivery time and the customer service that i receive from midwest sports i wear my clogs in all sorts of weather except when there is fresh snow but as soon the walkways and streets are clear i'm back in them with thicker socks of course they can be a little stiff at times but once you break them in after a couple weeks of constant wearing you will love them like no other	0

1	i really liked my tote bag what i liked most was the variety of colors and the size of the bag which is pretty durable considering that i use mine to tote my books in college the only thing that i didnt like was the outrageous amount for shipping let me tell you when i say the company sent the bag stuffed in a small manilla envelope but yet charged me what almost 6 or 7 dollars in shipping when in fact the enevelope probably costed about 50 cents to ship that was foul ! despite everything about the shipping cost the bag is a good bag and i guess i shouldnt complain as much	0

1	i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than 30 retail price even on sale was 60 the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i'm very pleased	0

1	this is a heavy thick robe i expect it would fit a man 6' tall perfectly i am 5'8 and the sleeves are only slightly to long but i do n't even notice now the comfort level is amazing this is so incredibly soft and warm you will put it on as soon as you get home and take it off when you go to bed i cant speak on durability as i 've only had it for a month or so but you most likely will not be dissapointed with the feel i got the brown color and i love it i feel like grisly adams in this thing	0

0	in the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable but it shows it in a smaller size than the one i wear so once i opened the box i was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome it could not possibly be worn with a low cut top which is why i bought it if you were a size 34d or above beware	0
0	i found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it 's worn the more it loses shape the shoulder straps i did n't find had enough support hooks for lift up i personally would n't recommend this bra	0

1	i have owned and worn this for several months now and it is very durable and warm as well ! i would just be cautious about the unisex sizing as i am a medium sized person \( 10 12 \) and it does seem to be a little large yet i wear it anyways hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	0

0	bought one for my new ipod nano a total disappointment very poorly made only glued together not stiched up it already started to go apart you wo n't be able to connect your headset because the hole below the case is a bit too small plus there is no belt clip or anything attacheable to one 's self when walking or working out it looks pretty but that is all	0
0	i absolutely agree with brett a warner these replacements feel horrible they do n't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991 's on i bought them at a local store which did not take returns so they just sit in the closet if you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will i wear a 11 1 2	0
1	i was looking for a durable checkbook cover that would last for years yet was n't going to take years to pay for ! \( ha ! ha ! \) this is a nice checkbook cover for the money my only complaint is that it needs to have a tab to keep your check register open to the page you are working on however it does have a loop to keep a pen inside you should desire to do so all in all a good buy	0
0	these broke within the first 3 days of use 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located	0
1	and i am very pleased with them they are very comfortable ! ! my sugguestion is to order a size larger if you have a little extra weight because the material can be a little clingy	0
0	buying this was a mistake this bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt the straps are not comfortable it 's cuts deep into the shoulders it should be atleast padded def not what i expected from this product the material and pattern is the only thing i liked it has a sexy look to it	0
0	i agree with the other review i love the tag free feeling but that was about all i liked about this bra the fabric seems really cheap after maybe 6 washings my barely there cc tagfree was feeling flimsy and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill for what they charge for even basic bras these days i definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months ! i would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric	0
0	very dissatisfied with the quality like several other reviewers relegated to cleaning after just one use	0
1	i give 5 stars for the easy spirit sandle i ordered i like it delivery is fast i will order something else	0
0	the photo is quite deceiving this suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap shiny and is horrible to the touch my three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit	0
1	fit well great for all kinds of athletic workouts i'm ready to buy a couple more pairs	0
1	i love these boots ! i got one size smaller than my street shoe and they were snug enough to fit perfect i can fit pants in them or over them and i have not had a problem yet	0
1	the earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter	0
1	i was very pleased with the socks they were just what we were looking for ! thanks so much	0
1	as the weather has cooled for fall and winter i needed socks for my baby i initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just did n't hold up as well i have also tried socks with grips on the bottom but they were so thick my son just sweated in them the children 's place socks are not too thick and very durable also the non slip feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked the other socks did not ! i strongly recommend these socks for your child	0
1	i just recieved my shoes today and ca n't believe that these shoes fit perfectly the wide size 8 5 is just what i needed i am already wearing these shoes with no break in required as i would often have with other shoes i love the value as i purchased these for only 19 79	0
0	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face however the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that i first used it it hasnt torn completely yet nevertheless i would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon i wouldnt suggest this produc	0
1	this is one of the most comfortable shoes i ever owned excellent quality and fit	0
1	this is ideal for wearing layers of clothing or if you 're dressed in a short sleeve over this one however i personally prefer the long sleeved version by the same company	0

0	i would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all the silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night	0
1	this is my 2nd set of these type of curlers the last ones stayed with me for three years they are so good i stopped using the big home set and use these type daily heat up fast great lasting curl \( particularly for hard to curl fine hair \) and do n't even need to leave them in that long would have given them a 5 but this set has the awful plastic clips that can leave a kink in the curl recommend getting or using a set of the old fashioned wire clips that come with most non travel sets if you want a smoother curl	0

0	i loved the bathing suit the first time i laid eyes on it so i purchased it i'm actually small but i do have thick thighs so i got a medium but when it was delivered and i tried it on it was too small ! i should have gotten a large the medium made me look like i had these big love handles so please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger but other than that the bathing suit is great i'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
0	did not fit well at all way too big around the ankles every step i took the boot would start to fall off they were the right size length wise and all just way too wide above my ankle they were about half as tall as they looked in the photo which was very disappointing i sent the boot back at my own expense the same day i would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first then ordering it off of here for cheaper	0
0	bah this skirt looks weird and cheap it is not sewn on the bottom just cut	0

1	i liked the shoes they look nice my only concern when i first received them was the quality of the cover leather at the begining it looked like plastic but otherwise they fit perfectly	0
0	i just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs \( from another online company \) because they seemed inexpensive durable and came in many fun colors i was sorely disappointed the colors are pretty but the material is crummy its rough flimsy and feels like plastic the pastel colors \( citron cool mint etc \) are almost see through and definitely show patterned underwear the tops run quite large \( i wear a 6 8 on top and the medium is very roomy i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again \)	0
1	i purchased a pair and have been using it everyday from the past six months the shoes are very comfortable and look very professional love them strong and tough not to heavy has good grip on snow	0
1	these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather	0
1	comfy tough lightweight wrinkly \( like me \) surprisingly durable considering how thin the fabric is good stitching velcro back pockets will save your wallet ! does n't offer lots of stupid exterior loops and gear freak cargo pockets not for the tidy country club set who need creases on everything but just perfect for active soccer dads or when the family hound insists on playing fetch with muddy logs and the like	0

1	this product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim \( so many types of luggage are similar in style and color we 've had trouble in the past \) several of our family members were given new luggage for christmas and these tags were included these tags are big bright lime green and can be easily seen no more headaches in trying to find our luggage	0

0	this publication has no business calling itself a magazine published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies this is nothing more than a fluffy info mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo do n't waste your money	3
1	everything with smoothly with my magazine subscription i actually started receiving my magazines before the date specified thanks so much	3
0	i would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since i have never received my subscription i have waited over 4 months since i first paid i have called and was told i would get a call back telling me when i could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine that was 4 weeks ago if you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else it is not here and no telling if it will ever be here	3

0	what is the national enquirer you ask \? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time avoid it like the plague	3
0	i ordered this magazine for my kids on 2 3 and have not received it yet	3
0	this mag needs a new editor i have n't seen anything interesting in better homes for six months maybe they are spread too thin with their website and contests	3
1	great magazine with in depth articles covering interesting topics around the globe i pity the fool who does not subscribe to n	3
1	this is a light and colorful newspaper i remember when it first came out the idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the united states as a whole it does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country the reporting itself is clear and very readable the paper lacks weight and depth it has a lot of variety in its features and clearly attempts to entertain the reader and somehow make the news more palatable it 's not a great newspaper but it often features fine reporting and there are times when it does a better job than more prestigious papers	3
1	i especially love this magazine because it gives details of different non tourist adventurous things to do either with the family or by yourself from canoeing to climbing a mountain i recommend it for anyone who likes the outdoors and likes to live on the edge and with this magazine you will know what most adventure ers dont	3
0	i started ordering glamour 2 months ago and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me there are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable ladies my advice is to save your money for a different magazine i dont recommend glamour at all	3

0	i subscribed in sept 04 and still have not received any single issue \( as of jan 05 \) there is no phone number or email address so the only way to contact them is by mail only they do n't respond they took my money and i never heard from them again finally i had enough and subscribed to garden gate magazine instead they are prompt and efficient and the magazine is great	3
0	oh lord ! ! does anyone still read this \? \? i was a subscriber back in the early 70 's when it was a folded up newspaper by and large jann wenner let people run it that knew how to it is now and has been nothing more than an ad choked gossiping teen slick right like they are the ones with the money ! ! i wonder what they still pay raoul duke to do \? \? ! ! ralph gleason has to be turning over in the grave	3
0	i ordered this magazine as a gift i paid for it on nov 21 '05 it is now feb 19 '06 and my daughter has not yet recieved her christmas present ! i will never again place an order with amazon ! barnes and noble has proved to be very efficient and worthy of my business i will at this point try to get my money back from this company and my daughter can purchase the magazine and all the missed issues off the newsstand	3
0	i was very disappointed with this magazine the tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them most articles are rather pretentious and boring in the 5 issues i have received so far only the may 2006 issue had any thing interesting and it only had two articles which were worth it the first was robbed blind which was about rfid chips and the second article was diy ways to go green	3
0	this is a good magazine for the home cook that wants to branch out from the standard family circle or good housekeeping no risk recipes my big problem with this company is once they 've got your contact information you will receive more junk mail than you thought one company could generate hawking every single publication they produce relentlessly i stopped subscribing and it took a year to stop receiving their snail spam and there 's no way to 'opt out' onlin	3
0	i subscribed to this magazine in january for my husband it took 5 months to get the first magazine then i never recieved another one	3
0	it has been several weeks and still no magazine from money ! ! ! ! oh yeah but they did remember to bill my credit card in a timely fashion maybe when something takes over a month you should bill the person when u ship the product ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	3
1	paula 's magazine is wonderful unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland they are all from paula 's cookbooks new recipes or from her friends none are bland they are pure paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for i have been fortunate enough to meet paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t v show paula 's party this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents !	3
1	i agree that veranda has too many advertisements but that 's the trade off for this very affordable high quality publication i'm not sure i'm the intended target for this magazine because i ca n't afford most of the things in the ads but i 've gotten lots of ideas about color layout and accessorizing that i can use and the variety of architectural and design styles has helped me define my own style	3
0	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines i have read motortrend car and driver automobile mag sport compact i do n't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny	3
1	i received my first magazine it is n't glossy or flashy but is full of in depth info which is exactly what i wanted not very thick for the money but i'm still satisfied due to the quality of the content	3
0	do not ! ! order from this website ! i purchased a subscription for oxygen magazine on jan 30 2006 and i still have not received the first issue i am very dissapointed to say the least !	3
0	laptop mag can be best described negatively it 's not a really serious computer magazine it 's more or less like consumer guide which is basically paid advertising this means you ca n't really trust the article here because you do n't know if they are not written by unbiased writers in the end i feel this is a waste of money besides you can get all the info for free on the web from cnet or zdnet anyway	3
0	for years discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science after buying discover since it 's very inception i find it sad what has happened to this magazine check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	3
0	the national enquirer has gone off the deep end and beyond the point of common decency to now attack a sweet wonderful charitable guy like clay aiken is very very sad to go after celebrities whose lifestyles are sensationalized is one thing but to go after a quiet humble guy like clay is another and now what \? is he supposed to justify their existence and have to defend this garbage their story is ludicrous and they owe clay his family and all of his fans a big apology i will not buy this filthy rag or any american media products ever again	3
0	a friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because i like cooks illustrated this magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants there are so few recipies in it i would n't call it a 'cooking' magazine what few recipies they do have do n't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all if you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what 's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine then this magazine might be for you if however you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it try cooks illustrated instead	3
1	i look forward to every issue the projects are top notch i have subscribed to several woodworking magazines popular woodworking is one of the best	3
0	why pay 34 when you can buy the magazine at a bookstore and order a subscription for 19 9	3
1	this magazine is wonderful it is very informative to the hip hop culture i am very happy with my decision	3
1	nylon magazine is amazing with a creative touch no other magazine has based in the great nyc this magazine oozes creative sophitcativeness originality and a sarcastic charm with amazing fashion art and espicially music the photography is pure genius and the layout will just want you to flip through the magazine again and again witty journalist contemplate to the magazine 's superiority who are honest witty charming and sarcastic if you have any taste for underground culture come pick up nylon magazine now	3
0	i subscribed to food amp wine for a while and was continuously disappointed the articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been i experienced more than one flop trying their stuff the magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad this magazine ca n't hold a candle to quot bon appetit quot or quot gourmet quot	3
0	i was so excited to receive my first issue of art in america and i was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full page ads for galleries in europe there are very few articles or artist bios the photos are beautiful but do n't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about american artists or galleries	3
0	if you are into high brow interior design then this is for you but my problem is not so much with the magazine as it is about their customer service at veranda and the subscription department 's ability to read they are by far the worst	3
1	i like this magazine but i like simple scrapbooks better it seems as though they have the same featured scrapbookers layouts in there all the time just from what i 've observed anyway i like the layouts they have good ideas great tips on tools and some good tips on digital scrapbooking	3
0	to be honest i do pick up this mag from the newstand 4 to 5 times a year but i can hardly call myself a fan if you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag wired is not for you it tries too hard to be hip and trendy but it 's group of left lib nerds too often come off as being lame and borish wired needs to be rewired to meet the needs of the modern tech community	3
1	this is a decent magazine and it 's good to support an unabashed christian magazine but if sojourners sometimes errors to the left christianity often persistently errors to the the right i subscribe to both and if i find myself agreeing with the editors of one magazine too long i dig back deeper into the bible and then come out in the right place contributor yancey is an inspiration and a true christian voice while colson is deluded by the high places of power and is a stain on an otherwise reasoned approach of ct	3
1	has insightful articles about what 's hot in the business world great articles on tech companies and wonderful ideas about how to get rich honestly the best thing about this magazine is that it gives an immense amount of motivation and inspiration to the reader i would agree with one of the reviewers however that it tends to go off course it has great potential and is definitely worth subscribing to	3
1	this is a fantastic magazine what i really enjoy about it is how often the featured homes are ones with small kids they show it is possible to have great design that works well with young ones too it 's comfortable livable modern now if only we could find a way to import the products shown here to the u s !	3
0	this is a disgusting rag full of synthol articles profanity porn and blurry black and white photos it has nothing positive to say about bodybuilding and it 's obvious publisher steve blechman only wants to destroy competitive bodybuilding at any cost	3
0	this magazine comes with lots of advertisements 70 or more plus articles \( less than 15 articles in every issue \) in the magazines are not very useful i subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers now i realize i made a mistake	3
0	i have yet to receive my first issue and it has been over 2 months	3
0	i 've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips activities posters etc however i have also gotten endless emails from mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance this continues though i asked them to stop for the last three or four weeks they 've been calling me on the telephone every day this continues though i asked them to stop the few good ideas in each 6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment	3
1	i read the review marci carl about the jennifer chiaverini books the quilter'ed apprentice i am as totally hooked on these books and have them all now as i am your magazine then i had to go get on the computor and found jennifer 's site now i want to get back into quilting big time my husband just rolls his eyes	3
1	i have given this as a gift to both my husband and father in law they are both very handy and own older homes it is perfect i even enjoy reading my husbands for organizational tips	3
1	i like paula deen 's cooking and find that i prefer to order my magazines through amazon because they send me an email update when my subscription is really about to expire so i can choose to renew instead of flooding me with 6 months' worth of letters in the mail saying renew now or else you 'll miss an issue invariably i never missed an issue but i certainly overpaid too soon by sending in subscription cards and renewing too early when i may not have wanted to	3
0	my biz partner and i were excited to receive our first mag from this group we were sorely disappointed most of the articles are not new information but quot rehashed quot info widely available we read it cover to cover for about 4 months then cancelled the subscription there are better sources out there and this is not one of them !	3
1	i find it to be the least biased among pc computer magazines unlike most of its competitors computer reviews are typically supported by objective benchmarks this magazine does not generally cover pc components such as cases fans and motherboards but it is immensely useful for their reviews of brand peripherals \( eg lcd printers graphics cards \) and computers	3
1	i have been a subscriber of shop etc since its debut when i heard that they were going to publish a magazine for familes i ran to subscribe and i have not been disapointed yet ! i love it	3
1	this is a great magazine ! i love the beautiful pictures even if i'm not looking for a project this is enjoyable just to look through i really love the fact that there are no advertisments just lots of helpful information with a very easy and relaxing layout it has a very neighborly feel to it also since it only comes bi monthly there is just enough time between issues to look forward to the next	3
1	this is absolutely my favorite magazine of all time if you want a magazine that caters to the lowest common denominator readsomething else	3
1	a good start to create your own business	3
1	no doubt wired is one of the best tech magazines in print but the subscription for wired for amazon is apparently managed by a company called synapse i subscribed for a year 's subscription in july and my first issue did not turn up even by mid november i had to call and cancel my subscription i now subscribe directly	3
0	this magazine is a waste of money and bores me nothing here to see but ads	3
1	car and driver is the multi purpose auto magazine it is a hybrid between magazines like road and track which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world and magazines like motor trend which focus on the more practical the magazine is always a fun intereseting read and keeps you up to date on teh auto world i must however say that it does not do as good of a job at rating cars as motor trend and it does n't have quite the coverage of the exotics as road and track \( and definitely falls short of road and track 's superb photography \)	3
0	2 months after ordering i have year to get my first issue i'm sure i 'll like it if i ever get it	3
0	our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still wo n't read the thing just like i do n't read the nation anymore	3
0	where are the critiques \? the articles lack any critical substance whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed it does n't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype vibe will go along with the flow on top of that there are more ads now than ever before even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space	3
0	i would n't know if this was a good magazine i have yet to receive it after waiting three months it is cheaper to order through food and wine website anyway	3
0	so i ordered the magazine in nov 6 2005 its now feb 22nd 2006 and the magazines \( since i also ordered the smithsonian and scientific american \) are nowhere to be seen of course my account was quickly charged and at this pace i'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before i receive any of them so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine it might be a better idea to get somewhere else	3
1	this magazine is an interesting mix of pictures of hot women wearing very little short articles on sexual improvement books health and beaty products if any other these interest you i would highly recommend this mazagine	3
1	an outstanding magazine even if all you wish to do is look at the pictures great ideas and for a great price	3
0	i have yet to receive even one issue i looked on the in touch magazine sight and it said that i have already received 6 issues i will never order a magazine subscription through this company or through amazon again	3
1	this is a great magazine for those of us who grew up in the 30 's and even on up into the 50 's	3
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd rom called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at 19 95 that there would be no monthly cd rom they charged us another 10 to have the monthly cd rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues but that cd rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd rom it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine	3
0	why is it that us weekly ca n't get a copy to me weekly \? sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue then i 'll receive three in one week us weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses i'm not buying their story or the magazine again	3
1	the week always seems to reflect at least three sides to every major story	3
1	being a garden designer i read lots of gardening magazines but this has always been my favorite it is loaded with design plans useful tips etc for the experienced gardener as well as the new to gardening gardener along with beautiful garden photos is also the story behind the garden the gardener and even how long it takes from start to fruition i look forward to each issue i only wish it were monthly	3
0	i ordered this thinking it was a magazine it is more like a newspaper it has good information but it was not what i thought it would be	3
1	how anyone can dismiss this magazine is beyond me it 's the best lessons learned \? chicks like dudes with money ! check ! chicks are totally into sex 24 7 ! check ! the new star wars movie is gonna rock ! check	3
0	i subscribed to bhg from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year the articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine with its overwhelming amount of advertising takes away from any good points i 've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads it 's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts i rarely find anything i 'd want to save overall a disappointment	3
0	once upon a time this was a good magazine worth reading cover to cover unfortunately they 've slowly been replacing content with more and more advertising as the magazine currently stands you could probably finish reading the actual content in about an hour the rest is advertising and bs this magazine jumped the shark a long long time ago just let it die already like it 's supposed to	3
0	i really enjoy how they illustrate and break down their lessons into different playing abilities even though they break down the lessons into breaking 80 90 100 straight hitter looking for power or power hitter looking for accuracy they are all very helpful no matter what your playing ability i think any golfer can take away a little bit of advice from the playing lessons unfortunately golf magazine seems to be a little weak on their travel side lately though not really focusing on that perhaps due to the downturn in travel in recent months i wish they would focus on that a little more like some other magazines such as t amp l golf or the golfer	3

0	as someone who is very interested in healthy eating and living i was actually appalled by this magazine it is ostensibly health conscious but upon closer examination it ignores important health information for example in one issue it had a whole article about diabetes and how thanks to the miracles of science diabetics can now eat sugary foods it proceeded to give a table of artificial sweeteners explaining when to use which a truly health conscious person would know that aspartame is suspected of causing cancer and that the only real way to avoid diabetes is to only include a reaonable and moderate amount of sugar in your diet i was disappointed with the magazine	3

1	not as deep as macworld but worth the subscription due to the alternative perspective on software and hardware very fun to read with a unique style of writing the reviews can rarely be spotty with lack of depth as the culprit in some cases the majority though are on target the best part of the magazine are the unique 3rd party hardware finds overall a great addition and enjoyable read	3
1	there 's a lot to like about lenswork the selection of images the quality of the printing bill jay 's end notes but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment brooks jensen \( the editor publisher \) does n't appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it all that matters is the image and after you 've finished looking at the images you 'll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue too highly recommended	3
0	harper 's bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine but i wish now that i had never gotten a subscription true each issue would be more expensive but1 \) i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying as some are thin and empty2 \) they are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue i have only gotten one issue on time to be honest	3

0	i 'd always heard about interesting articles in this magazine but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands \( with a big heavy thud \) on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i 've ever made the mistake of purchasing it 's pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders self regarding movie celebs and those people who 'd like to be part of that world even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent it 'd be more accurate simply to cut fair out of the title	3

0	although 'camping life' does contain a nice article or two each issue the thrust of the magazine seems more to be a showcase of nice big campers rv 's rather than the experience of camping and related camping activities i subscribed sight unseen from the boy next door who was selling subscriptions for school i will definitely let this subscription lapse there 's just not enough love of camping and the outdoors in the magazine however if your camping interests run more to great big rv 's and all the related gear you might find some value here that i did not	3
1	i subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to woodworkers journal since 1990 each magazine has a character of it 's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents this magazine is a bit more complex than say wood magazine it should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified i have one of woodworking journal 's projects in my living room it is perhaps the most beautiful piece i have ever made if you have become an advanced amature \( sp \? \) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others	3

0	but that 's the lowest we 're allowed to give this magazine is more for 16 year olds and up too much focus on getting a boyfriend and making out every 10 year old 's top priority right \? plus my daughter found extremely crude language in the latest issue magazine refused to discuss the matter when i emailed and called them ! says it 's geared for girls 8 and up but that 's a huge age span better off with american girl magazine this one 's to mature for younger girls	3
0	i cook almost everything from scratch so i figured home cooking would be for people like me who make the effort to make good quality home cooking without the silly ingredients you see in some of those gourmet magazines instead recipes consist of packaged dough in a can bottled sauces etc i do n't need to read a magazine to figure out that i can put a jar of spaghetti sauce on some pasta and add velveeta to make a casserole !	3
1	the london review of books is without a doubt the best literary journal in the world at the same time erudite entertaining and informative each issue is a foray into a world of knowledge that is all too lacking in other publications and media there was a time in my life when i could n't afford to put my heating on in the bitterly cold british winter but i never thought to cancel my subscription to the lrob highly recommended	3

1	i always enjoyed going grocery shopping with my mom while she shopped i hung out in the magazine section reading mad cracked and fangoria now 25 years later i finally got my own subscription and unlike retro video games nostalgic 80 's cd 's and members only jackets this is just as good as i remember it gives the inside scoop on the up coming major studio horror releases the low down on independent if not underground extreme horror dvd 's and as always has awesome pictures of rocking special gore effects any fan of the horror genre would love this magazine it is a great read and a lot of fun	3

0	people magazine is one of the worst expressions of american life instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting which is possible people encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images people we will never meet and in many cases people who have very little going for them does anyone really think that britney spears has anything to say about anything or that paris hilton is barely aware of her own existence \? does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times j lo is engaged \( in order to get on the cover of another magazine \) or who demi moore is grinding with today or where gweyneth gets her gowns	3

0	i subscribed to forbes magazine for a year or two and in general the content is good but i cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons \( a \) 33 of the pages are all advertisements what a waste of space \( b \) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as i read the magazine and \( b \) the classifieds in the back are not of interest to any real business person if you do n't mind the ads and the fluff then this magazine might be right for you ! it 's not for me i give it 2 stars	3
0	i just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one i bought for my 14 year old grandson for some reason ziff davis marketers think that full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for pc magazine \( dec 27 2005 p 122 if you want to check it out \) previous issues had partial page ads selling sex pheremones which i could almost overlook but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line	3
0	was a subsciber for many years mainly due to extremely balanced reporting indepth coverage etc then starting about 1 2 years ago the magazine started to take a left tilt \( i do not consider myself right wing am registered as an independant but do like fair balanced coverage in my news \) since the beginning of this decline the atlantic has become more and more just another liberal magazine the bias has also led as it always does to less in depth reporting since they tend to now ignore any aspect of an issue that does not support the left bent	3
1	this is a great foodie magazine we think the writing is what makes it great it is always interesting has some recipes to try and is not the usual food mag stuff very enjoyable	3
0	more and more all the industry wants to do is tell you what it is you are supposed to like and ridicule anything we might consider to be a guilty pleasure and if you indulge in such a thing you are 'shallow' music has evolved past this attitude and no one believes in this naked emperor anymore and oh yeah their politics is so mixed up they do n't even know what they believe anymore i was a subscriber for eleven years my renewal notice came and i could n't come up with one good reason to send it in	3

1	the high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the united kingdom a subscription over there runs about twenty bucks however even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside icreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials top notch magazine and highly recommended just wish imagine publishing would recognize the potential of this product and start producing this as well as a few other of their excellent magazines here in the states	3
1	i highly recommend this magazine to anyone interested or immersed in the graphic design industry i have kept every single issue and frequently refer to them for ideas reference or to simply get those creative juices flowing how 's biggest asset is their dedication to helping the reader understand the business side of the industry and the all important client relationship how does not exclude anyone in that they address the different issues agencies and freelancers face when conducting business	3

1	most of this magazines travel articles and ads are not targeted at someone like me i'm a homemaker with a limited budget i do n't travel much or am in the market for the fancy things they advertise however i just renewed my subscription becuase when i have tried the recipes in the magazine they were really wonderful i 've added every recipe i 've tried from gourmet to my 'keeper' recipe binder i admit the dishes were harder to make but the results were definitely worth the trouble	3

1	uncut is without a doubt the best music mag in the world right now but why on earth would anyone buy 12 issues for the price of 15 \? this mag is 8 bucks in any of the stores mentioned in the other reviews here not 11 an issue which is what this subscription breaks down to whats up with that \? also if you get a subscription direct from uncut 's wesite it 's literally half the price they 're selling it for here	3
1	as a straight female i offer a unique perspective on this magazine i think it 's totally hot i really like the fiction and the guys are such cute young hotties ! some of them look a little mean for my taste they look so challengingly at you instead of invitingly but then again a lot of guys in porn look this way to me this is normal for porn i guess very few if any of them are over beefed \( too muscular \) and some of them are n't muscular at all which means nice variety the fiction is my favorite of all the gay mags i 've looked at lots of first times nothing really bizarre or violent overall a cool magazine	3
1	few magazines can match the new yorker 's high caliber of journalism fiction reviews and of course cartoons all written by some of the best writers in the land it makes mainstream magazines like time and us news look like high school newspapers but one word of caution if you 're the type of person that whines liberal bias at anything that you slightly disagree with then this is not the magazine for you	3
1	i actually really love this magazine the articles are down to earth and helpful not cheesy and shallow like those found in cosmo the editorial staff of lucky seems to really relate to real women and are n't bitchy and pretentious like other women 's magazines	3
1	i recommend this magazine to really learn techniques to improve your running level there is not alot of filler in this small magazine i find that this is the magazine i do n't circulate with friends because i like to keep the articles for future reference i learn something new each time	3

0	this magazine consistently encourages parents to spend more than 100 on babya outfits etc it is not a magazine for most of america but rather for the elite or those who wish to pretend they are there are way too many ads and insignificant articles parents magazine is hands down the winner in this category	3
1	i have been subscribed to this mag since before ps2 came out and it has always proved to offer reliable well explained and accurate reviews as well as early previews and interesting articles not only is it good to read but it comes with a demo disc which is packed with demos video previews game files and other helpful and interesting features if you are trying to choose one mag to subscribe to this is the one you want	3

0	like a reviewer below said this magazine was good a while back try back in 2002 it used to have better tips and less filler now it 's all filler seriously there are maybe 5 quizzes which do n't say much a dream decoder which is complete phooey and yes the many tweeny posters that i 'd be embarassed to have on my wall even if i were 11 i grew but sadly this magazine did not let alone stay the same nothing is serious in here it 's like the magazines that tweenybopper brats read age reccomendation 9 12simply put this magazine is like m magazine but not as infantile	3
0	i have subscribed to in touch since september last year and it 's time to renew but i'm not goint to because this megazine is never arrived on time \( at least 5 of them just failed to arrive \) i do n't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service i would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining	3

1	excellent selection of recipes anyone can prepare in just 30 minutes no need to be out of ideas for any party or get together just open the book to any page and you 're set and ready to go or should i say cook !	3
1	the american spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual not only are the articles witty and well researched they also provide well articulated arguments to the most pressing \( if sometimes slighlty out of date \) controversies of the times well worth the subscription price or even the cover price	3
1	this magazine is a great way to get a book club to focus on what to read next basically the magazine is a collection of all sorts of best lists to suit every taste the selections page starts with a collection of staff favorites highlighted with a one \( do n't bother \) to five \( rarely given a timeless classic \) star rating system there 's a digest of 27 best books 2005 lists in a recent issue a page on the whitbread awards a selection of current and upcoming books reader recommendations new in paperback a year in books \( e g 1981 \) etc coupled with very little advertising it 's great !	3
0	unfortunately i have not received the item it 's been 4 5 weeks since i placed the order i am reviewing this a low star it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription	3
1	alrightly folks it does n't get any better than this this magazine blends humor with serious reviewing they will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite like me ! anyhow i 've read this magazine for a while and i 've never been disappointed the ask the 800 lbs gorilla section is a riot the bottomline gamer this is an unbiased not corporatly owned \( like opm and xbox magazine \) and a pleasing magazine to read anyone hooked on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a psm and get a subscription	3
1	my son is a sports junkie at 7 years old he gets really excited everytime the issue shows up in the mail it is an easy read for him and he loves the posters and pictures included in each issue if you have a budding sports enthusist i would definetly recommend this magazine besides the more reading your child does the better it is for them no matter the reading medium	3

0	my dad bought this magazine for my mom and i usually pick up the copies to browse them that is all both my mom in her fifties and i in my twenties do browse it as it is a joke it is not that special it is chucked full of ads the cover stories are dull and boring and many of the articles you would want to read have about one paragraph good information i find this magazine a waste of our money it will not be getting renewed at the end of the subscription my mom has already stated that	3
0	during the 1960 's when my sister subscribed to ahmm the stories mirrored the fantastic television show the stories were primarily mysterious creepy and unique with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great now the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain uninteresting detective stories i subscribed up until about the early 1980 's but stopped because of the same old boring cops and robbers material i tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that ahmm had n't changed subscribe only if you are a fan of pure police fiction	3
1	this is a magazine this is a magazine \? do yourself a favor and pick this up if you can get it for less than 20 an issue \( like i do at my local borders \) excellent quality	3
1	i really enjoyed the first issue sure it is about high end products however this mother is happy to find an alternative to pastels and winnie the pooh	3
0	do not order they only placed an order for 7 months but i got billed for 12 after 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it after pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but cannot extend the subscription only order from the magazine itself	3
1	i remember when this magazine was the lone conservative voice on the newstands i too have memories of many long latinate sentences which mr buckley provided and i had to try and figure out it is not that i always agreed much less understood him but i did feel that he was a man walking to the sound of his own drummer who had a real concern for public life in america and his own ideas of how to make it better i also saw through the years that he edited a very intelligent opinion journal which explored many aspects of american reality the magazine today seems to me still to be of high quality though mr buckley is no longer at the helm	3
1	agree with the other reviewer nothing like this in the states no country kitch no traditional just straight modern clean pretty rooms homes it 's expensive that 's the part that stinks i buy it at 7 50 an issue but it 's worth it b c it 's modern there is a lot of minimalism which you very rarely see in u s magazines i keep every copy of this they are always good for reference i read them each dozens of times over	3
0	american photo began as a magazine devoted more to photography than to gear as an alternative to the gear obsessed magazines like pop photo and photographic it has evolved into a magazine that divides its pages between equipment obsession and cheesy quot glamour quot photography that tries for art and delivers soft core porn no stars	3
0	i have never gotten this product so it 's hard to know how to rate it wish amazon would send me things in a timely manner	3
1	this magazine if full of fun fashion items ! it shows you some great ideas of how to do things for the upcoming year ! its a definite go ! !	3
1	although i have yet to subscribe to aperture what i 've heard and what little i 've seen advertised in one of sally mann 's famous publications is enough to arouse my interest and i ca n't wait to partake of a first issue of 'aperture' feedback from other members is always anticipated and welcomed	3
1	equipment technology technique and clothing this magazine has it all any tip that helps the amateur photographer capture and improve his or her scenic travel and wildlife images can be found within its monthly pages	3
0	if you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what 's really going on in the world read this magazine national review is for people who sympathize with christian jihadists and white supremacists would n't want to be in that camp if i were you read time mother jones the nation or the american prospect instead	3
0	after 1 month i have n't receive the product it 's to give a good review until it arrives	3
1	this is simply one of the best movie magazines on the market you can always be sure to be updated on the latest movies and dvd releases and it 's nice that the crew of empire does n't take themselves too seriously the articles are well written but keeps the humour intact as well where other movie magazines seem to be too keen on showing how intellectual they are unfortunately it 's rather expensive here in denmark but it 's worth the price	3
0	what is the national enquirer you ask \? it 's a phony as hell newspaper that provides all the latest gossip about celebirties but they come up with fake stories half the time avoid it like the plague	3
1	this magazine is one of my nightly treats ! i take it with me to bed and read it until i fell asleep dreaming about the vacations awaiting me this great magazine covers just anywhere in the world i have learnt a lot about travelling i even love it 's advertisements \( the vacation packages \)	3
0	great magazine but beware of subscriptions my subscription was paid for back in august '06 and i have yet to see a copy \( january '07 \) their customer service have assured me twice that they would send out my magazines but nothing ever arrives plus the phone number they provided is not in service ! its a shame because the magazine looks to be really well done	3
0	i subscribed to food amp wine for a while and was continuously disappointed the articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been i experienced more than one flop trying their stuff the magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad this magazine ca n't hold a candle to quot bon appetit quot or quot gourmet quot	3
1	ever since i owned the magaines i thought how cool a magaizne full of naked guys i have to say that i am glad that i already orded the magaiznes agai	3
0	this is a tabloid so most likely the stories you 're reading are not true why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that a rumor	3
0	i remember back in the middle '90s this magazine was think probably anywhere between 1 5 2 5 inches it contained ads reviews supplier lists benchmarks and sometimes trial software well i have picked one up sense them and they are now a centimeter thick \( if your lucky \) they contain reviews that are well written or well read and a whole lot of ads my conclusion do n't buy it if you want reviews buy pc magizine or pc world and if you want ads surf the internet	3
0	i ordered kiplingers and us news on march 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions today is october 12th and i 've never received us news i 've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course i have n't received when i requested a refund of course i was given the wrong amount if you want to order magazines i agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while amazon is great for books that have n't got the magazine business straight also the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess	3
0	we paid for a 12 month subscription and i got the magazine for about 4 months i could n't get anyone to answer why it stopped and basically they just took my money i did n't get a 12 month subscription i got ripped off plus when i did get the issues they are very poor paper quality and the covers and some of the pages were always ripped and bent up very disapointing	3
1	the new yorker for food is often how i describe this magazine to colleagues and friends the articles are well written though occasionally idiosyncratic it is one of two magazines i subscribe to \( the other being the new yorker \) if the alleys and byways of food are as interesting to you as the grand boulevards then this magazine will appeal to you it is not gourmet or martha stewart \( not that i have a problem with either of those titles this magazine is just different \) but if you enjoy food writing about varied topics from a slightly academic point of view this magazine would be a good choice	3
0	i read rolling stone for the music and those who make it not for some guilt ridden agenda blasting editorial team that feels their politics \( and guilt at being so much the establishment they wish they could hate \) is something we should all read about at nauseum when they stick to music it 's good when they parade their shreiking political views it 's boring	3
1	today i received the first issue april 2006 issue i foundit amazing and informative resource for body mind andsoul practices toward healthier life the most thing i liked about this magazine is that it respectsreligions it provides accurate information from various religionsto help people of other believes improve their lives \( relying to what i read until now in this issue	3
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3
0	this was kind of an impulse buy for me and i did n't get what i thought i would get i thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in tv and the movies instead i got indepth ramblings on actors and directors if you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler this is not the mag for you	3
0	the magazine is not bad marginal at best to my surprise i am now a member of a club i also was surprised to receive the first of a series of gardening books \( mine to keep for a small fee \) needless to say the description for the magazine was not forthcoming with the additional items and obligations \( mailing the book back etc \) all i wanted was the magazine i do n't like to feel like i was taken advantage of please pass on this one there are plenty of other good gardening magazines to order	3
1	i absolutely love this magazine ! it is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong i will be 38 in a few weeks and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine i read it from beginning to end and my husband even reads it he always asks if i saw the article on this or that which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging if you are serious about your health want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level this is the magazine for you	3
1	relevant magazine has great articles for people who are in to culture and faith many of the reviews are of secular artists the spiritual content or message \( or lack thereof \) of the music they sing films they make and books they write they also review christian artists many who are on the fringe this is a great magazine for those who are interested in these things if you just want a 'youth oriented' christian magazine with bible studies and how to 's you 'll probably be disapointed	3
0	great for filling the doctors office magazine selection if it 's free but not worth your money to own i bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here oh once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine but not consistently the home section is n't that inspirational either go for it if it 's free but if it 's not do n't buy it	3
1	yes ew has changed over the years but i believe it 's as relevent now as it 's ever been the articles are interesting and the reviews usually right on the mark i read it cover to cover	3
0	i ordered the magizine subsribtion and when i ordered they told me it would take up to 6 weeks so i went out and bought that months issue a few weeks later that issue came which is understandable but they had sent me the previous month before that i hadnt even ordered my subsription that month	3
1	fhm is absolutely gorgeous ! hot and sexy covers great entertainment and fashion info men lifestyle is discussed in this magazine make sure that you subscribe yearly to save up cost	3
1	this was a very good price for a very good magazine i saved 3 5 overthe normal subscription rate	3
0	i got this magazine as a gift starting a few months back i really ca n't say i'm impressed admittedly i'm much more left leaning than this conservative \( sometimes very very conservative \) magazine dispite my bias i can still recognize good writing and well made points this magazine generally lacks both this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything they 're just fairly rare if you want to read a well written well argued conservative mag this is n't it	3
1	i know it takes eight weeks and maybe longer but i do appreciate the information that i 've gained from store bought maximum pc magazines i do n't build computers but when i do order one it is nice to be familier with the workings and attributes of the new computer yes you can find much information on line and generally faster than the amount of time it takes for the magazine to reach your mailbox however is great to kick back away from the computer in your favorite chair and 'read' about it \) a very good magazine but 'adult' language used at times does not appear to me as professional use of the english language thus the 4 rather than five stars	3
0	i subscibe to this magazine will not renew it either ! maybe i am too old to appreciate this periodical it is way overpriced even with the amazom and others discount	3
0	we received first issue of guitar world and there was no bonus cd rom called the magazine and was told that since we purchased the subscription from amazon at 19 95 that there would be no monthly cd rom they charged us another 10 to have the monthly cd rom added to the subscription for the rest of the issues but that cd rom is mentioned in amazon 's editorial review of the magazine you get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine but you are not because you do n't get the bonus cd rom it turns out to be the same rate as if you buy directly from the magazine	3
1	this magazine compares favorably to quot american heritage quot with its interesting and accessible but well researched accounts of the past each issue focuses on a person \( i just read the story of thomas aquinas and had n't realized his fascinating interaction with muslims \) or a movement \( the huguenots who 's sad history led to their dispersal from france to all over the world including the revere family moving to massachusetts \) all in all an intriguing glimpse at how christians of the past continue to influence us today	3
1	entrepreneur magazine is an easy read that allows us working professionals to have access to fresh ideas and interesting articles i consider it a bargain given the amount and quality of information i receive for about a buck there are a lot of ads and subscription offers to deal with but that seems to be the case with most media i do not consider this a substitute for reading books on business it is a good complement however	3
1	i ordered a subscription to si for my boyfriend 's birthday he was so excited and surprised ! his first issue came even before they said it would i highly recommend the magazine for any true sports fan	3
0	first off i subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years and enjoyed it but the main guy robert kennedy is someone who offends me both personally and politically he assumes that every girl women reading that magazine is tiny for his information some of us work out 5 6 days a week and eat well and are still heavy set his comments on heavy set people are offensive thoughtless and sometimes even downright cruel nonetheless the pictures articles were inspiring to me and it is a decent fitness magazine	3
1	this is a magazine i frequently get confused with foreign affairs magazine the primary difference is the longer well written essays by leading experts in affairs whereas foreign policy has a more frequently published more up to date and more direct version of the other it would be great to have both since policy keeps you more current with a high degree of professionalism while the other gives you the deeper detail if you do n't have a lot of time to read policy is the one you 'll need and enjoy	3
0	as is typical of many magazines sunset jams it to existing subscribers they offered me a deal to re subscribe for 12 months for 29 95 ! here on amazon i can get two years \( 24 months \) for 29 95 magazines need to understand basic marketing it takes a lot of advertising dollars \( mailings \) to get a new subscriber once you have a subscriber it is easy to keep them if you treat them right charging existing subscribers double what is offered to new subscribers is bad business	3
1	i ordered a free trial of this mag a while back before starting my own e business recently immediately i began a subscription the reviews from pros on real businesses offer a lot of insight while the profiles give it a real world feel i would recommend this to anyone even considering working in the high ranks of any business keeps you informed and in touch	3
1	under the radar and filter are the only music magazines i come near i hear mojo is just as informative renovative and enjoyable but i'm a little too close minded to care about other genres i do n't care much about fans of rock pop what the kids are calling indie alternative punk post punk folk ! ! ! ! take a gander at this and the covers are slick and durable they do n't look out of place sitting on a coffee table	3
1	of the big 3 \( fortune forbes and businessweek \) i like fortune the most businessweek feels like it 's always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose to report and analyze the business world fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does	3
0	we subscribed to this for a school fundraiser the first issue came november 13 with many useful coupons only they expired in october 2006 ! i wish i could get my money back on a useless magazine filled with alot of advertising if you want a decent health magazine try prevention they have alot more to offer than this rag save your money i wish i had ! take the time to search around i hope this saves someone from making the mistake i had	3
0	i send away for a 2 year subscription they sent me a 1 year sub i wrote 5 letters sent copies of bank cheque and order form emailed them no response they could care less what more can i do \?	3
1	this mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality it 's an icon all over the world the editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism she and vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent without vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi billion dollar industry	3
0	this is not the health magazine you 'd expect from martha stewart it 's extremely heavy on advertisements \( 45 at my rough count \) and really cluttered and just not good the recipes are interesting if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin hydration ads	3
0	this magazine seems to exist solely to promote their advertisers and their products their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is when they do focus on the best work of the design community their examples are puzzling they choose work that is often genuinely awful and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows \( comarts adc graphis aiga one club \) while that would be admirable had they found other good work most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best there is a reason this magazine is free	3
1	i purchased this subscription for my 13yr old nephew who just loves it it is wonderfully informative reading matter that really has something for everbody in it now only if he would put it down so others can look at it	3

0	i got this magazine as a gift starting a few months back i really ca n't say i'm impressed admittedly i'm much more left leaning than this conservative \( sometimes very very conservative \) magazine dispite my bias i can still recognize good writing and well made points this magazine generally lacks both this is n't to say that i 've never seen a good point or anything they 're just fairly rare if you want to read a well written well argued conservative mag this is n't it	3
1	this is the best fashion magazine on the market very realistic with budgets too it shows different ways in which everyone can be fashionable \( on any budget \) i also enjoy the beauty articles because they have original ideas to stay in style and keep your skin looking beaufiful	3

1	i started reading the economist after a recommendation from a professor during my undergrad years that was 9 years ago reason blended with wit and intelligence the articles in the economist are a perfect antidote to the often insipid stuff put out by conventional newspapers once i get my weekly edition you could n't blow torch it out of my hands \( my wife has tried \) the economist is one of the few newspapers that has consistently defended the classical liberal perspective free markets civil liberties and skepticism of those in power in my opinion it has no competitors i could n't rate it highly enough	3
1	after reading several digital photography books and going to grad school classes i found this magazine to be far superior to anything published in this country there are many articles on artists workshop type tutorials as well as the latest and most fantastic hardware and software for the digital fan i believe this magazine has something for everyone from beginner to more advanced at relatively low cost in addition i have found two other british publications digital camera world and digital photography techniques \( both at www dcmag co uk \) that i would strongly recommend for those who can afford them	3

1	this is the best business and money magazine out there they cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you did n't think of	3
0	sure i like a mystery who does n't \? but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story the tales are hard edged and lacking in style and substance we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment the value for money is horrible the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge alfred hitchcock would not be proud	3
1	i 'll let others argue whether or not the quality of the magazine has subsided over the years i for one still get something out of the writing ca n't do without my monthly dose of harper 's and the atlantic what i would like to point out is that why would you buy here when the subscriptions cost less on a m 's own website	3
0	i remember not quite four years ago when this magazine actually had pc substance and catered to a sophisticated pc oriented market now it 's thin hollow interminably off topic and ad choked	3
1	as an author i find oprah 's magazine to be the most inspirational any human being could use to start their month divorcing a wife because you can not be all she needs is a very loving act everyone deserves intimacy emotional and physical if a gay or bisexual man loves his wife her happiness will be more important to him than his own setting her free to allow her the opportunity to be loved as she deserves to be is the ultimate expression of love dennis j schleicher	3
1	i just received my first order and i love it ! this magazine covers a broad range of topics and includes designer techniques current trends period styles and so much more it has tons of vibrant pictures to illustrate the articles i think this magazine would be ideal for someone just starting out in design to gain a basic understanding on a wide range of topics and also for the experienced designer to keep up with current trends and fill in the gaps with knowledgeable tidbits	3
0	i have enjoyed reading family fun magazine but unfortunately have only received 2 issues i have not received any further magazines and am completely disappointed in the service i will not order another magazine from amazon because of this poor service i tried to get a refund and have only gotten the run around	3
0	elle used to be a great fashion magazine but no longer ofcourse there are too many adds \( but then that 's what pays for the mag \) i just wish that elle and many other fashion mags would quit presenting all these articles \( the hard hitting type \) on serious subjects that do not belong in a fashion periodical i buy elle for the fashion beauty advice not to read some pseudo intellectual writer 's hard hitting political agenda for hard hitting news items i read the wall street journal atlantic monthly and watch fox news	3
1	this magazine is wonderful it is very informative to the hip hop culture i am very happy with my decision	3
0	psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all	3
0	i hate this magazine i subscribed sight unseen based on the good reviews and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat way too exotic if you like good ol' american fare do n't buy this one	3

1	my boy loves his drinking funtainer ! it has never spilled on his lunch box even though i have put it in different positions including upside down ! it it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will not spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot ! the straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and i have not had to replace it and the year is almost over ! ! very durable i love it and i'm planning to buy more ! it is well worth the money and i bought it for 15 00 ! !	10
0	i recently purchased this item and with the first nite of rainfall it crashed down the cheap metal sides were bent and it became useless a waste of over three hundred dollars	10
0	this bed was a real disappointment from the beginning we actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it it 's just a fabric cover perhaps with an extra layer of material but it can't be foam maybe only 1 4 thick at most then after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4 rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally bad bed	10
1	i think that the sword itself is great the casing is cool and the mounting wood is nice the only things i did n't like was that the keychain greiver fell off once i took it out of the box i also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade otherwise i think that i got an amazing deal	10
1	my daughter loves this toy it 's brightly colored and she loves the honking legs the tail part is only about six inches long so unlike the previous poster i really do n't see how a child could strangle themselves with it	10
1	the drishti yoga strap is just great ! i 've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga \( several different studios borrowed friends' etc \) this one is excellent it 's 2 feet longer than standards straps but it 's offered at the same price as standard straps what a deal ! it 's also thick and sturdy i would certainly recommend this product	10
1	i use this bag while attending classes in college and it is perfect for all my needs	10
1	i recently purchased the gofit 40lb weighted vest and it 's everything i hoped it would be i was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts and this vest has proved to be a good choice the weight is balanced well between front and back of my body the shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks the velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement i have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting though it does hamper some bending movements the weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter i am well pleased with my purchase	10
0	i recieved umbrella from unclesams umbrella shop of n y then returned it as it was too big i have never recieved a refund of over 25 00 i would like to know what happened and when i will get my money back umbrella was picked up by ups on 03 07 05 i can be reached at vlb47 earthlink net i look forward to a resolution to this problem thank you vick	10
1	very satisfied to find this speedometer available perfect to put with my schwinn cruiser deluxe 7 had been searching for something like this for awhile would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear	10
0	i also bought this because it was the consumer reports best buy and i expected to get a lot of use out of it the frame broke on my first \( i weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week \) after about 1100 miles and its replacement just died after only 350 miles so far i 've paid about a dollar a mile i 'll never buy from schwinn again	10
1	hot water in my flask does n't stay hot enough for a whole day out and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature i have n't tried heating water from cold it is always at least warm when i start it takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious but it does a good job the clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug does n't \( it flops about \) so i have to hold it to keep it properly immersed it cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush	10
1	i used to have a similar product this one works the same except for one little handy detail it does n't stand on itself like the old one i had	10
1	a quality product low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over easy to assemble ca n't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside ! have been riding it inside mostly using our legs \( we 're not yet 2 yrs old \) to scoot around however our bigger cousin \( just turned 5 yrs old \) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars this trike will last a long time and thru many kids	10
0	had to return the first one due to non functioning thermo and fault compass small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed i also have a brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer we 'll see how long the 2nd one lasts	10
1	this has been a great addition to my truck a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system \( and without having to learn another techno gadget \) my only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter i realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one 's night vision but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night	10
1	our card group of ten people play president which requires three decks and a large table this unit makes it easy to pass the decks around the table to whoever 's turn it is i added a teflon furniture pad to the bottom and we can easily slide it from one end of the table to the other	10
0	i consider my dogs to be small they are all around 25 pounds i have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and i still feel like they are a little bit too big i think that for a small backpack that they are just too large thank you	10
0	i bought this based on the other review it takes forever to inflate and when it does the seal where it does must be very poor all through the night it leaks air and becomes quite soft i am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated do n't waste your money like i did	10
0	basically the title says it all i figured for a 100 dollars i would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge basically this is a poorly made toy that should n't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred like i said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the tru break putt 'n hazard the only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet	10
1	2nd suunto 1st was a vector bought in 2000 that i abused pretty good before having to get another \( water seal was damaged and it took on water during a kayaking trip \) doubt i 'll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training highly recommended	10
0	the first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit the seller forwarded the photos and complaint to texsport and they sent us another top when we put that top on we found the same thing that is when we found the frame was 4 longer than the top there were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner after cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together when next spring comes we will replace this one and i can assure you it will not be a texsport product	10
0	i was extremely disappointed when i received this product contrary to the description the handles are hard plastic not comfortable and soft as it states on the product packaging and website other than that it may be a decent product but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin i 've already printed the label to return to amazon beware the other review of this product the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on amazon not only is it not informative there is a good chance they have never tried the product	10
0	i bought this for my wife because of it 's low cost you get what you pay for she uses it a few times a week after a little more then a month the left pedal broke she is not overweight at all so that was n't the problem i 'll spend the money for a good one next time	10
0	my daughter would love a trampoline and i would love to buy her one but i do n't know which one to get her the airzone 8' trampoline seems perfect but i also read the reviews for the airzone 13' trampoline which got terrible reviews i do n't know what to believe can anybody help	10
0	shame on me for not reading the reviews on this product ! it is garbage a waste of time and money	10
1	this bar is great when used properly i e make sure the door is closed when you use it i was surprised how well it worked much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches	10
1	so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand not to safe missing file holder is the only reason i do n't give it five stars	10
0	this does not fit on super 9 rifles as far as i know besides it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny ! \( most scopes are whatever zoom x30 for example i own a 3 9x44 scope this means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom the second number refers to the size of the scope lens i 'd seriously reccomend a 3x30 if you can get one also make sure it 's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail if you are getting it for the super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight \( peephole \)	10
1	i get frequent ear infections any time i get water in my ears i took these to a water park and they worked perfect they are very soft and wont make your ear sore	10
1	powerbars were created out of necesity to be efficient not to taste like a 2 50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out if you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food eat food like a steak a piece of cake or a banana power bars were made for energy in the 1980 's people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them power bars are practically synonymous with the term energy bar because they are the time honored benchmark try a cliff bar or a snickers if you are looking for something tasty when you get tired of those and long for something more in life try a powerbar	10
1	i'm just turning 14 and i started skateboarding about 3 months ago i got one of those cheep walmart special skateboards and i couldnt do anything with it then i got these bearings and popped 'em in and they are slick and smooth i swear this made my board a good 20 times better	10
1	if you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit very nice software a lot of nice information very well presented speed sensor is reliable and accurate \( does not suffer all kind of interfence such as gps units \) error is really smaller than 5 even during long runs the information available during and after the exercise is great \( temperature altitude calorie count all hrm metrics such as average maximum \) bike sensor provides speed distance etc fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen	10
0	i do n't really write reviews but i felt like i needed to say something about this one maybe its me but i could n't get the pump to work so i bought a new basketball i bought a regular one and bought a pump i wish that infusion thing worked out because it would have been great to deflate it put it in my bag and then pump it up again at the court but my friend warned me they do n't work so good i'm just stubborn i guess that 's my 2 cents take it for what its worth	10
1	i have 6 children 4 could n't ride bikes the scooters teach balance without worry about pedaling the kids feel safer because they can hop off easier now 5 out of 6 of my children are riding bikes and the last probably will be soon great toy	10
1	i am the leader of a team called point 0 i got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks it shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more the scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night it holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top but do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping i am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks	10
1	i bought a flybar 800 a few months ago and its the coolest thing ever you can jump super high on it and the people that work for flybar are awesome i emailed them when my ruuber tip broke and they responded a few hours later and sent me a new one for free	10
1	i bought the wave about 1 week ago and i got the hang off it in 3 days now i master the wave drill and high speed turns its worth your money \( im 10 years old	10
1	body max is a very tough dvd i did n't find the step choreography too difficult to learn but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced i do recommend watching the cardio before attempting or you 'll be rewinding quite a bit like i did cathe 's cuing is great especially while teaching the combo the complete workout is long and tough but completely worth it if you do n't have enough time there are several premixes that have shorter lengths the premixes may be shorter but they 're no less intense	10
0	there is nothing wrong with this product it 's how you use it we almost ruined our 300 trampoline in it 's first week by using this product we put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine it rained the next day and filled completely with rain water causing the trampoline to nearly collapse it took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through by covering it you do n't allow it to drain unless you live in a very dry climate i do n't advise using a cover	10
1	i just returned from a 20 day trip and this new backpack went along it is comfortable commodious and just the ticket i have a 25 year old jansport backback \( still ticking but a bit tattered \) that i have used and used and i expect this one will provide the same service it 's great	10
0	i went to swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others this is the only pole they have which is n't saying much for the brand but i found that the suggested retail is 4 lower to what amazon is selling it for just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price even though amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap probably too cheap to be any good	10
1	this is perfect ! the purple is a dark purple and my girl loved it ! there 's no confusing this scooter with her sister 's \( which is pink \) she loved it and ca n't wait to get it outside to ride all day thanks	10
0	this sounds great in theory being that you do n't have to get under the car to drain the oil fantastic ! but while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars i do n't quite agree you still have to get under the car to change the oil filter so i 'd suggest saving 50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car which is actually faster than using this device	10
1	do n't listen to the uneducated reviews here these are great for hitting the heavy bag speed bags focus mitts etc the length of these 108 makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves the 170 180 are for sparring and competitive bouts that is why ringside makes different lengths there is also a 120 length which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps	10
0	i bought both the ark iii and the super ark the super ark is a slight improvement over the ark iii but i would never recommend people buy either one there are far better entry level kits for just a few dollars more available from other sources the ark iii contains 24 oz of water a food bar and a small inexpensive emergency blanket in a kleenex sized cardboard box i 'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits i subsequently purchased i'm surprised and disappointed amazon carries these products	10
0	absolutely no use to me whatsoever next	10
0	i ordered the pogo roo pogo stick on dec 6 2006 and i am still waiting for it to be shipped they just bumped it back another month to mid may for delivery and yet if you go to the web site it says it is in stock best of luck to anyone who wants it within 6 months ! very poor service	10
1	i bought one of these for friends that have children and one for a friend who is married without children they all seemed to love it !	10
1	for the price not a bad piece of home gym equipment cushion could be softer but overall it works the back abs real good	10

0	i bought this model a year ago and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months just recently the deck cracked again of course the warrantly no longer applies save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand	10

1	i bought this for my son who is 4 he loves it and can operate it whith out any help good quality and can take alot of abuse	10
0	i bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking but after i say 2 3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars at a critical point i did carry a heavy backpack in the basket but still i think the basket is a piece of junk plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork which limits your height of your handlebars the basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable i ca n't recommend this basket buy a basket from your local sports authority or something thanksdarealdeal	10
0	i got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k and it defiantly not 95 accurate i run 10 11 minute mile yet both on the treadmill and outside this watch was reading 7 5 to 8 minute mile distance was also off by 20 when running speed and distance 98 accurate for walking 15 min mile	10

0	the first time i used these push up bars the flimsy plastic they 're made out of cracked in three different places perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely but i'm not going to risk an injury finding out in the trash they go i suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing	10
1	i bought this bike for my boyfriend for christmas it arrived in about 3 days rather than the expected 5 7 we set it up on about half an hour it comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up i read an other review \( prehaps on a different bike \) that you need a cresent wrench however for this bike you do n't he uses it every night and i use it a few times a week it 's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet granted i 've only had it for a month i would definitely recommend this product	10
0	all this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres i ca n't think of anything else i have ever bought that was as completely useless as this it is a toy pretending to be an air pump the nonfunctional lever on the top \( mentioned by other reviewers \) indicates that it was designed as a toy i'm just happy i was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway not out on a trail in the past i have bought a number of bell products including motorcycle helmets i now shudder to think what might have happened if i had put one of them to the test	10
1	the display is pretty much perfect but as a display it is supposed to keep balls facing forward a litte bump inside holders allow balls to move	10
1	do you even know what you are talking about \? i may be a kid but i have been airsofting for 5 years now 350 fps is nothin my ak47 airsoft gun goes over 410 next time please know what you are talking about before you give a bad review	10
1	i have been very happy with the hang ups and have used them for the last month i have not had any issues and they look to be built very well	10
0	this is not as described it is very hard to move heavy and bulky if you have a place to set it up and leave it fine but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the tv' as described performance wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use i'm disappointed	10
0	this sounds very stupid i'm sure but i ca n't get the battery cover off in order to put in the battery i unscrew it with a coin as i'm told but when i ca n't turn it with the coin anymore i still ca n't get the darn thing open	10
1	bought this bike for my wife it arrived a day late for the next day delivery the packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok the directions for assembly could n't have been more clear and easy to understand it took me about an hour taking my time to put it together the bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time also very comfortable	10
1	we just got it i first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine and i let it sit for a day and a half it lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long we are in the caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight this works perfectly	10
1	very useful stopwatch i like the mutiple functions my use is for swim workouts this watch allows me to have three intervals going at once the print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture not a real problem i am glad i bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes	10
1	this is one of the only things i have every bought sight unseen on amazon this canopy is very well made and a breeze to set up and put away the carrying case on wheels is an extra bonus	10
0	the radio has no presets so you have to manually click through radio stations til you find the one you want the clips breaks off easily the pedometer just stops working mine stopped working after 1 month i returned for a new one which stopped working in 2 weeks do n't bother buying cause it wo n't last long enough to be worth it	10
0	i 'll be returning right away suction cup does not hold at all completely useless	10
0	this is the worst purchase i have made from amazon or anyone else the first unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable after a number of calls to tech support it was decided to return and replace the unit amazon promptly replaced the treadmill this one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function my friend at tech support did not have a clue he suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit it is not clear what i am to do with them i strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer	10
1	this product is pretty much what i expected the latex is a little dusty looking not a clean crisp red at all however it gets the job done for those pilates exercises	10
0	i cant say anything for the other things but the compass does not work at all north is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same north does does not i was looking for a simple compass keychain this is small and a keychain but a compass that works it is not	10
1	great flooring system easy to assemble and very strong expensive but worth it	10
0	the wood is very nice but the design manufacturing is very poor my experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating the holes are n't properly pre drilled the hole at the top did n't match up with the cap plate hole which a \) made it very difficult to screw together \( the first screw stripped \) and b \) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly i experienced the same issue with shallow pre drilled holes in the bottom and the bolts not going in all the way i never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions based on the wobbly central column i decided to disassemble mine and send it back	10
1	i really like the heart rate monitor and it works great as has been said it takes some time learning all it does but it 's worth it in my opinion the only thing i was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit but from what i have been told by others and their brands of running watches they all do this to an extent everything else i'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone the distance reading has been right on the money after calibration	10
1	these ropes are great for double dutch they 're very fast and long so you can do two people at a time i love double dutch it is a lot easier with these ropes	10
1	i bought this hiking pole to take geocaching with me it 's sturdy lightweight and retracts for easy storage it 's also nice that it absorbs shocks a good product for the money	10
1	this is a wonderful gym it is similar to the boflex but without the high pricetag delivery was very fast i am very satisfied !	10
0	i got this item to give a a gift i got it fast however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken it was n't worth returning it because if you 've opened it you can only get a 50 refund and have to pay shipping which would have cost more than what i would have been refunded do n't bother with this one	10
0	bought this machine based on the reviews on amazon it was okay at first i workout regularly with tapes outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week by the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain we tried to see if we can fix it but it did n't work i ca n't use it anymore mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere you get what you paid for ! ! ! now i'm looking to invest in something more sturdy if you exercise once every month this is the machine for you !	10

0	i purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down next the piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy the first time the wind picked up it blew the whole thing apart so for a one time use it is okay the money spent on this was a waste it also looked in places like it had already been repaired \( seconds \) as in 2nd class merchandise	10
1	this swim cap is easy to use and thick enough that i ca n't imagine it ever ripping or tearing	10
1	i bought this mat for my exercise bike it was large and gave my floor great protection i would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment	10
1	smooth and easy to use also easy to run on not quite as portable as i thought it would be but to have a quality machine i guess it needs to be a little on the large size	10
0	i was very dissastisfied with the product the 16 inch dora bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter we had to keep it in the box until christmas eve so that she would n't find it when i started assembling it that night we found no training wheels or seat i was very upset for obvious reasons how do you tell a 4 yr old that santa forgot the seat and training wheels for her bike	10
0	i bought this item based on other people 's reviews i'm sad to say they were wrong maybe it 's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box the gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as i started firing it it sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go my recommendation well just look at my title	10

1	we purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to jamaica we were very happy with the us divers product the price was right and the fins worked just as expected they worked just as good as sets we have rented rather than renting fins at the beach we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean	10
0	not very bright for an led and guess what \? this is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so i do n't blame amazon but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this	10
1	it cost 3 times its price just to ship i did n't really expect to be amazed but it is sturdy if plain the sheath does n't really make it a decent wall display but i think it will out last any cheap show sword	10
1	these bikes arrived very shortly after ordering were exactly what i was looking for and were fairly easy to assemble the only glitch was that one bike was missing a fender and i did n't know who to contact	10

1	we purchased the mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks the kids think its great it takes a good half hour or more but worth it make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container it can be hard to get off really easy to clean	10
1	i had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product the box was literally falling apart when it arrived luckily no parts were damaged on the plus side the package arrived very quickly the bench has lots features for the price it was not difficult to assemble it folds up very nicely as advertised it is sturdy and easy to adjust this is a very good value	10
0	this may be an acceptable ramp for a child 6 8 but an older child would laugh at this one i was embarrassed to even give it to my son	10
0	they look nice but they 're badly put together i had to re sew all of the fingers within the first month	10
0	when i purchased this item i got the impression that the kit \( looking at the picture \) included everything but the gazebo which is the frame you should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit i need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it the title of this item should say gazebo screen and not gazebo screen kit unhappy custome	10
1	this is the same toy i was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle the women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store awesome toy for infants since it 's light easy to grip and easy to bit my son loved this toy for 2 3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys	10

0	this tiny item ships for 2 more than it costs i 'll purchase it elsewhere	10
0	i really wanted to like this lantern it is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price but the light output is pathetic the package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it but i find that doubtful the light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob princeton tec or photon in fact i think you could read a map or a book play cards or follow a trail more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights i'm returning mine	10
0	package missing it 's never be received so i cannot rate it	10

0	this product never worked buttons were defective it would n't stay on it would n't calibrate the seller sky box usa would n't exchange or refund because i was outside of the 30 day window \( this was a christmas present and a very disappointing one at that \) you 'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a casio watch	10
1	i bought these clear color version as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer according to the gift recipient they 're excellent they really do n't leak or fog up he was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that did n't get any water in his eyes \( but please note he does n't swim for more than one half hour at a time so i ca n't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity \) he also said that the fit is very good and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types for the price these are an excellent bargain	10
0	i loved the machine until it broke there's no friggin' technical support or repair options from schwinn they do n't care	10
0	i dont have this item but how can you expect this to be a good mask if the list price is 100 and they are selling it for 2 50 ! ! !	10
0	the handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous also the base metal footboard is cracking i would n't spend the money on this scooter it 's not worth it spend your money on a cheaper model razor	10

1	it is a good one strong and to some extent heavy i improved a lot	10
0	this cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline but every single time it rains i have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle ! it is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly more damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it ! this is a worthless item	10
0	i guess you get what you pay for this pedometer was difficult to calibrate and continued to miscount steps and therefore distance covered it is made of plastic and came unclipped easily i am a big person and have started walking to improve my health this product does not work for me although it might be a different story for a slim person it has been relegated to the junk drawer and probably will eventually be thrown away i 'll have to find another that works better and purchase it	10

1	this step is great it really adds variety to my home workout i use it on carpet and it really stays put it does n't slip on the carpet and i do n't slip when i step on it i was a little worried because it did n't have a rubber stepping surface but it really does n't need it with regular athletic shoes	10
0	i bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure i found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to i'm used to a 60 sec sweep and the minute hand was difficult to read i really had to check to see if i was at 1 5 min or 2 5 min	10
1	works great used it to drain the oil in my 2005 vw beetle tdi	10
1	most posters here have n't actually bought used a toilet monster it 's a really great joke prank we bought one and used it for my mother in law she was stunned and a bit disoriented then wait for it she laughed really really hard it 's not scary just startling the way we installed it if someone opens the lid and seat they wo n't see it so it 's best to try on women great for the price	10
0	overall poor quality in craftsmanship one can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed the wood is of subpar quality as well the price is low however i would not recommend these swords	10
0	is it squeeky \? yes but i did n't mind what i did mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use i did n't use it vigorously and i'm only 160 lbs i 'd say avoid	10

1	we looked all over for a quality dartboard with a cabinet and this one was by far the best for its price	10
1	these straps work great they are nice and thick and seem to be made well they 're easy to put on and they stay out of the way when you are n't using them valeo made a nice strap	10
1	this is a very good lock in this price range the rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night the only downside is the key you must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning otherwise you might bent the key	10
0	it wasnt very good and it didnt tell how bad it wqa	10
0	the foam rubber on my handles is shredding on the edges after only one month not worth the money	10
1	i bought this backpack last minute for a weekend in the columbia gorge area it worked great the backpack does n't strain my back at all the load felt very even and the attached rainfly came in handy once as well it comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras \( tent rods sleeping pad rope etc \) i am thoroughly impressed to have found a good pack for such a bargain pric	10
0	about average for the price nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight the wide beam is fairly faint with a strong central spot this one will go out into the garage and likely stay there	10
0	i got this zafu \( meditation cushion \) it is round in shape and too high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on around 9 inches high and 15 18 inches in diameter it is also pretty heavy around 4 pounds due to the sheer size i could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it i would recommend trying it somewhere before buying the filling seemed of good quality	10
0	let me just start by saying this gun is terrible the images are misleading the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic but it is a dull black and it smells really badly at first not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps and is sold at 300 my friends did n't even notice being shot i have a 300 fps pistol it leaves welts through jeans this isnt 300 fps it 's a rifle fit for an infant who 's been dropped on their head and thinks it 's good never even shot farther than 80 feet bad buy	10
1	my physician told me to exercise or else so i looked at comsumer reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike amazon 's price was great and i have been delighted if you like to read and exercise this one 's for you	10

0	i received my stamina products adjustable hyperextension bench on march 13th of '07 and was very disappointed there was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box the product was scratched and parts were broken fortunately the bench works but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage the product seems to be of quality it 's just unfortunate that sps does n't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap	10
0	i bought this for my 5 yr old and he ca n't even get it on his head he wears other youth bike helmets so i would n't recommend this item unless it 's for a 2 3 yr old now i have to pay half the price in return shipping	10
0	this would be a great rebounder if it were not so cheaply made one month after happily using it a spring broke then another it is one of the least expensive models out there and i guess there is a reason for that best to save your money and buy a more expensive model	10
0	this is a useless product i do not exercise much and i do not even get a burn from this machine the dvd is boring and the instructor speaks in a mono tone it looks like it is low budget !	10
1	i bought this bike after not riding since i was 14 \( 32 now \) the box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled i also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town i'm not a trail seeker so have never tried it off road very happy with the quality and ease of assembly	10
1	i bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab great dane mix and it is pretty big on him admittedly he 's still pretty skinny despite his weight but i had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him probably better for broader dogs but i'm sure mine will grow into it o \) the quality is excellent and there 's plenty of packing space overall i'm pleased with it especially for the price if your dog is skinny narrow i 'd order the next smaller siz	10
0	these balls are horrible they do n't bounce like regular balls worse yet once they come up from the ground it does not come up straight it goes to the sides most of the time	10
0	do n't order this item or anything from mercantilla inc the product was a different color than advertised it was missing three important parts without which you ca n't use the bench and many of the other parts were damaged i 've never had this many problems from any of amazon 's sellers this was supposed to be my holiday present but it turned out to be a real disappointment	10
0	this stand is very bad quality not worth investing in this stand the speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood it vibrates too much ! the swivel it comes with is made out of plastic ! it sucks ! invest in a better stand like the ones from www balazsboxing co	10
0	when the scope arrived it came slightly cracked on the end you look through which was n't a good start then when i looked through there was no magnification just small red crosshairs if you are looking for a functioning scope do not buy this scope but if ur looking to decorate your gun then this looks pretty cool on it	10
0	even if the electronic ball return had been included with this product \( as described \) i still would have returned the item the mat was very lightweight with many folds in it so it was n't really suitable for the intended purpose	10
1	this is the best knife sharpening system i have ever owned the kit has 2 medium sharpening rods 2 fine sharpening rods a booklet a vcr instruction tape the plastic storage case which doubles as the base i can easily keep my spyderco delica knife razor sharp also my wusthof kitchen knives \( even the serrated knives ! \) this kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives	10
0	i bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews big mistake ! the cardio boot camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing the beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun if i knew what was n't included i would n't have bought it they should list what 's not included in the description it seems somewhat deceptive	10
1	found the edge 284 easy to asemble and use it was less expensive than comparable models i checked out at 2 large fitness stores in my area and i did n't have to figure out how to get it home it was delivered for free	10
1	this is a great snorkel seals well against your face and the water really does stay out if a wave comes by the purge valve on bottom works well	10
0	i 've been using this mat for a little over a month for a 5 day a week practice at first i was thrilled but at the end of my 2nd class i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet it 's continued to get worse and worse 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me since i practice in a studio it 's particularly annoying i practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up the jute side is the side that flakes practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor	10
1	i bought this ball as an alternative to a regular office chair i am able to work on my abdominal muscles while surfing the web or other computer work it helps me to stay focused on the work and not get frustrated with not being able to move around it is exactly what i was looking for	10
1	this bike seat is a huge pain to install on a bike it took my husband and i working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it would n't work we persevered and got it on it is fabulous to ride with our son it is very sturdy our son is very large and rides in it just fine the helmet slides on his head but most helmets are tricky to get just right overall we have been very happy with this purchase	10
0	basically i ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks ! that was really long especially because i upgraded my shippping i dont' like this because the grip is n't really grippy \( lol \) and the strings make your hands hurt because they 're kinda loose the only thing i like about this is that it donates to breast cancer but i really do n't recommend this raquet i bought an n code right after i tried to use this 3 times very unsatisfied this wilson does n't live up to the wilson reputation for m	10
0	this is the first review that i have done on amazon so far i have purchased over a dozen items on amazon and by and large i have been content happy with all of them except this product this product is made of a cheap hard plastic and the assembly socket for one of the bars actually cracked when it was assembled do not buy this product shell out about five bucks more for all metal push up bars	10

0	we bought and then returned the scuttle bug it was well made and easy to snap together however it was far far too small for our 27 months old daughter who happens to be very petite \( only 25 percentile for height and weight \) her knees dragged the ground i think it is a cool product but maybe for younger smaller children we wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic ! !	10
0	this bench is a bit of a joke unfortunately having put the bench together myself i can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on it 's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two very small pieces of metal balanced over the main structure i feel foolish for buying this bench between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a maximum total weight of 300lbs including you and the weight you're lifting i think it would be a mistake to purchase this the maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet it 's narrow and small	10
1	the science is sound but check it out yourself police military etc are using it fortune 100 other governmental agencies schools should use it if they do n't it puts the kids into their best possible learning state seriously 5 stars is not justice 50 000 stars 50 000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone the power the brain when coherent or not is tangible and it 's driven by the heart you can sense it in a person anger happiness whatever it 's the healing state it 's the creative state it 's where hormones balance	10

1	we had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted we investigated several brands models and vendors the schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value and given the free shipping amazon had the best price so we ordered we were not in any way dissappointed assembly was reasonably easy and the bikes are working out well for us	10

1	this is the best wind up light you 're going to find i advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus i got mine at the local target store and i think it was only 35 00 and well worth it	10
0	i used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed 1 \) it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2 \) the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling \( luckly i noticed it floating near me when i stoped to clear my mask \) referring to this product as 'waterproof' is criminal as everything i placed in the holder was saturated with water even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water in addition this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day	10
1	i just bought the speedbelt 2 deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me so far the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5 10 mile run range it fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle for longer runs i 'd suggest the 4 bottle belt but this one is great for the intermediate range the belt fits comfortably and i did n't feel that it bounced around much at all recommended	10
0	this gun is absolutley terrible the third time i shot it the thing broke ! the pellets it came with were not even perfect circles and you could not load them i would tell you more of how bad this was but i really do n't want to waste any more of my time	10

1	this bike mount is solid and well made the instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly there is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted the only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames we added some padding and taped it on and it works fine however	10
1	i bought this for my neighbors little girl and she loved it ! it was easy to put together just took a few minutes and away she went ! great price and i got a big hug	10

0	you cannot sit upright in this chair bad for soccer games \( why we bought it \) the chair is designed to lean back the company is not amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth unless you plan to sleep in this chair it stinks	10
0	it may be a good piece of equipment but it's too big it's big because you can lean on it and do leg lifts etc but all i wanted to do were crunches it was hard to put together only because the screws would not fit into the slots i almost broke my fingers i gave it away and bought a smaller roller that works better for me	10
0	the important top hand bar is missing the thing smells like gear grease i ca n't tell if i like to use is because it 's missing parts	10
1	i have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road while playing sports to drink while i am in class the bottle washes easily in the dishwasher the narrower profile fits easily in cup holders i highly reccommend the n gen it is much larger than 24 oz if you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity it is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market you can also use the bottle as i have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack	10
1	excellent service and a quality product at the right price i had no luck finding foose balls locally	10
1	my son is 5 years old and absolutly loves this digger it was easy to put togther and is very durable i would highly recommend it he also likes that it has tracks so he can sit on it and move it where he wants	10
0	the reason i gave it one star is because of how it affected my body i am an athletic person and very agile but this is one of the workouts that i will never do again i have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and i was in tears i had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it my knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and i could hardly walk i'm sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain please stay away from the ball workout	10
0	this mat may have a design flow or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll in the process the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat i suppose it 's still functional but my brand new mat looks pretty awful	10

1	it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it	10
0	these seats while they are as nice as they look do not fit into a seat at the stadium rendering them useless ! they take up 1 25 seats per and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them especially if you have 2 they need to make them a few inches smaller	10
0	the ab roller was a big disappointment for me it was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts then once that project was done i was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me as a very petite \( 4'11 \) woman my hands barely reached the top bar making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly so beware shorties out there	10
1	i go to anime expos alot and to to be honest this sword aint half bad unlike its 67' brother its only 37' but its a whole lot better to wield combat ready very sturdy and made in china i notice some swords made in pakistan ! and they usually end up breaking so this swords worth the buy if your a bleach fan and if you wanna save some cash	10
0	three days after i put this on my keyring the two parts of the highgear smartlatch broke apart and i could n't put them back together then a week later the compass popped out of the case it 's now in my tool drawer perhaps only mine was this fragile	10
0	i receieved the valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous i purchased them after i lost my previous pair of tko fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems i put on the valeo straps and did one pull up and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in my advice this product is poorly made and cheap a complete waste of money go with something better and i would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric	10
0	well the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good i dry shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen ! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank ! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games 1 5 out of 5	10
1	after polishing alloy wheels i treated them with boeshield it leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels	10

0	do n't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch this monitor is sold as providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout reebok did to substantiate this claim get a strapped monitor for working out while this is a great idea the design does n't match the intended purpose	10
0	i saw this design and thought it was a great idea after using it twice my wrists still hurt now i know why i could n't find this design at my local sporting goods store	10
0	i received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly but i was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball it no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper ! unless you hit the nylon target you have lost a ball ! i may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if i miss the target	10
1	this rack was great and easy to install but i never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night i installed it some person backed into and ran off what made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch since i was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off i painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands over all i though it was a great rack i just wished someone did not back into it but i know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car truck	10
0	i used this ball with exercise video 4 times on the 5th day my 16 yr old daughter was sitting on it talking on the phone and it exploded sounded like a tire blowing out and the ball ended up with a two foot piece blown out of it not just a hole	10

1	great item but really too large for 3 year olds maybe good for 5 or older	10
0	living in florida i bought two of these everlight flashlights the party that said there was enough charge during shippins is a little shaking in the head it takes at least a couple of minutes of of shaking before there is even a glimmer of light after that if you don't continue to shake it dies out very rapidly this light may possibly come in handy during a hurricane power failure but there are other led flashlights with batteries that are superior to this one the power used by these leds is low and the batteries last a long time	10
1	loved this mat ! great for taller yogis great tickness too a bit slippery but after a couple of sessions it wears offi totally recommend it !	10
1	just like the ones used in college intra murals excellent stitching and look to be very durable fast shipping and great deal	10
0	my husband bought me this for christmas and we were both disappointed the graphics are awful some give me a headache the songs are awful they all sound alike its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard the pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly i 've had it two weeks and already i'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss i gave it two stars because my kids \( ages 6 and 2 \) love it but then again they do n't know any better i am using it to get better at ddr but then i will invest in a better pad and game	10
0	when i was assembling this product i discovered that not only were the instructions vague and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured the predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height my thought is how hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth \? luckily i own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers \? i wish i could give this product a higher rating but hopefully there are better alternatives	10
1	the knife is sleek and has a great profile i love the speedsafe function on it the blade lock is a bit stiff but i suppose that 's just so it does n't slide open on accident	10
1	this is a great helmet my daughter has been very happy with it and loves to wear it	10
1	i'm a small person at 5'2 so this 24 denali is perfect for me i bought the 26 one and liked it but it was too big so gave that one to my husband the bike was easy to assemble no problems with delivery very quickly i like the way the denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike it shifts smoothly rides very nice this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it !	10

1	these were purchased for a client who has severe arthritis and works outdoors our winters here are very cold and he found he had much less pain in his hands and fingers using these gloves	10
0	this compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers the pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break the card \( actual compass part that spins \) wobbles a lot so it 's difficult to get an exact bearing it is like the oil in the compass is very thin also the direction line lid spins easily making it possible to take a bad reading ironically this is the silva weakness as well if you need an inexpensive engineer style compass consider the silva for a two more dollars you get an aluminum case a hinge that wo n't break and a card that does n't wobble with the slightest hand movement	10
1	if you can stick to a workout routine this home gym is perfect for you after a bit of assembly you 'll be able to do all your exercises at home	10
0	bed is not even after few hours of sleep very difficult if two people are sharing the bed when one rolls in the sleep other person wakes worse still you will get up with back pain shoulder pain even if you manage to sleep	10
1	great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym it 's heavy and very dense very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym 's heavy duty takes dropped dumbbell punishment and resists damage cuts use a drywall t square as a guide and put a new blade in a box cutter take several passes to cut it and take your time it cuts straight and square for a professional look i will definitely buy these again when i get a bigger room for the gym	10
0	we bought this for our 2 year old daughter it was a nightmare to put together then it did not fit becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes we bought a 20inch frame men 's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting not worth it ! !	10
0	i got this because it was cheap at k mart and thank goodness i can return it the ball is really small i love how they omit the size from all of their information i did n't pump it up with the pump so i do n't know how good that is \( i used an air compressor \) the other equipment is n't too bad but i was really getting this for the ball which just so happens to be a piece of poopola i would n't suggest getting this	10
1	bought this for my husband for father 's day ! delivered in no time ! he loved it ! i let him do the registration etc because he has more patience than i it works very well bought the vice like attachment too so it could go in every golf cart we use including our own i love it i have trouble judging distances and this is our co toy now ! the battery went dead too soon we called sky golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste we even bought the 19 95 warranty for one year it 's worth it !	10
0	i had a different experience than the other reviewer i would also consider myself a beginner golfer but the medicus has not worked for me it might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time but if you are trying to improve your swing it does n't help you develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge but it is still a bad swing i heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it but not good for beginners	10
1	mine is blackened scratched dented and i do n't even carry the insides any more but i love it this is usually the only cooking pot i carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water the wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow i think it 's part bucket this is the one	10
0	this is the second nike watch i ordered the first one did not work and isent it back to amazon amazon was great and sent me new one this one worked for a few days i then had the battery replaced two weeks after it stopped working by that time i had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen i have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain i am am glad i have had this opportunity to vent in short the watch is awful	10
0	excuse my english but if youre a delicate person then its good for you but if youre like myself then this product would last arround 4 days like mines all i did was walk to my job for half hour and it began tearing apart it wasnt defective its the material its made out of the product itself is a good idea but the material is delicat	10
1	i love this machine the strech is allowed to happen at a slow and gentle pace and the legs are nicely supported the only draw back is the retraction process sometimes i have to push a little futher in order to release the latch to pull the legs back in other then that b e a utifu	10
1	i have had problems with exercise bands that break fairly easily although i have not had this one long it has shown no type of wear and i use it every day ! i would definitely recommend this product to someone who wants to add resistance to their workout	10
0	this software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit i am sending the gps i just purchased along with this software back to amazon the software will not communicate with the gps and the company will not respond to any of my support requests the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available and the live technical support is a complete joke after 20 minutes of being on hold i spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english and offered me no help i knew more about the software than him and i 've only owned it 3 days i 'll never purchase from magellan again	10
1	the plastic side mounts \( 4 \) appear to be solid and not flimsy i replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones \( you know since this is going on a boat ! \) but at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless the package says includes all stainless mounting fasteners so i guess that means hooks only the supplied screws are not even galvanized so if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat go get stainless screws that are also 1 2 longer than the ones provided all in all it 's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get	10
0	i thought this would be an actual toilet monster and was happy to see such a low price it is however made out of rubber and can not actually eat people	10
0	this does not fit on super 9 rifles as far as i know besides it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny ! \( most scopes are whatever zoom x30 for example i own a 3 9x44 scope this means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom the second number refers to the size of the scope lens i 'd seriously reccomend a 3x30 if you can get one also make sure it 's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail if you are getting it for the super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight \( peephole \)	10
1	i bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them ! inexpensive but not easy to find i was told easy to use my dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on christmas morning	10
0	the bag is nice and everything but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into also my feet got cold because of the zippered area not really sure i understand why it 's there my feet never get warm usually cold i liek the material and the look also seemed to keep me warm on a 60 deg night	10
0	this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it does n't say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you	10
1	there 's not much i can say about this item it works and that 's all i really care about no leaks it 's never cracked and it 's stood up to some serious abuse	10
0	like other users i found the light output substandard i bought it specifically as an emergency light source if i really needed this light there really would be an emergency ! absolutely pathetic	10
1	these clubs are great for a starter the best part is the price i was n't sure if i would really like playing so i did n't want to go out and spend a fortune i found these clubs in the store and they were well over 100 so i went with amazon and got free shipping the clubs arrived much sooner than expected and i paid a lot less ! i am very happy with my purchase	10

0	i have an original thighmaster i purchased years ago thinking this thighmaster gold was going to be similar i purchased it to take to work with me it is very flimsy it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up my old thighmaster is very sturdy i have been using it for years and it looks fairly new this one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year save your money	10
0	i tried this last year and by the second day i woke up in great pain i tried it again a few weeks later hoping it was n't the juice that caused the pain the first time and the same thing happened i give it 2 stars because i actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff	10
1	its weighted and feels quite real it only holds 40 bbs unlike said in the product review buy a bunch of these at the same time because this company has outrageous shipping charges i recommend taping two together \( facing different directions \) to reduce reloading time in a match	10
1	seems to be a good bike have n't had time to ride it much yet	10
1	except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen shorten the strap again does exactly what it is supposed to do and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability great for spotting oneself too i would buy it again tho i do n't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe so if you can burn the 35 or so get it with no fear otherwise use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout	10
0	i will never deal with this company again ! my product arrived late and was obviously very old due to the corroded batteries in the airsoft gun it would not work after we cleaned it and i got no response from the company i had to throw away the gun along with my money i have enjoyed amazon in the past but would appreciate them reviewing who they allow us to do business with thank	10
0	bought mine sometime around christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to st thomas last week it died within 10 minutes of being in the water it was never more than 5' down while i was snorkeling while i never tested the compass or thermometer against known accurate ones it seemed to work well enough for my purposes just keep it dry	10
0	well the arm rests will not stay in their holsters they flop around so you cannot get maximum impact from the machine i am totaly disappointed with this machine	10
1	this product is n't a miracle product but it does do a few things it supports your back it is comfortable it does make you sweat \( mostly on your waistline \) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit it 's not a bad product overall but do n't expect a miracle you have to do the work for this product to help you at all i do use it any time i'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects	10

0	i bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it so i thought i might like the alps chair too i was wrong it 's very light weight but it 's a lot longer than my other chairs which made it more difficult to carry and transport the arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings one of which broke the first time i used the chair the next day three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless save your money on this one	10
1	i am very pleased with this product it is good quality easy to use and well worth the money	10

0	i rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid 's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike i also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child 's bike straight but i never recived the part i am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they did n't help me i hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs thank you	10
1	i live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before but with this lock i have n't had anyone even try to steal it it 's not as heavy as i thought it would be \( a plus \) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket it feels solid and looks strong too i would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be	10
0	this stuff has a very strong smell like wd 40 or something if you can stand the smell you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store at least then you 'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt i bought this stuff because i thought it would be odorless like all other treadmill lubricant i 've bought but it is n't odorless it really stinks i do n't like that permeating smell in my house especially in my workout room i recommend the lifespan 100 silicone lubricant it 's a little pricier for the quantity you receive but it 's the good \( odorless \) stuff	10
1	ca n't really go wrong here a metal post some rubber grips and a couple of wheels it works great and was the cheapest i found just a tip if you 've never used it before do n't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet you may be tough but you might also hurt your back start on your knees until you know for sure you 're a tough guy	10

1	i have been practicing mixed martial arts for four years and i have gone through all of the major glove brands in my opinion everlast has always provided gloves that provided the most effective wrist support which means less twisted wrists especially for beginners everything else is well done but not exceptional it 's comfortable and provides durable padding although i myself have only used the 16 oz versio	10
1	it works as advertised not a lot to say about a bike rack i have hardly any wobble from mine and i suspect those that do did n't assemble theirs correctly or are n't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough my only complaint is the weight it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack which i do n't quite understand the vertical tube has the lowest load with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube but it 's not that big a deal it just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly	10
0	i was extremely disappointed in this item i think it is a good concept but it does n't work well at all it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it i tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that i drank anything it is awkward to drink from too i can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market not worth buying just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation	10
0	i am disappointed with this product as i thought i was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which i give to my patients this one is made of nylon and elastic the stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use the elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart go with the stretch out strap which i have been very pleased with	10
1	i had my knife for 10 years and would still have it if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever i leave the house one night i was heading for a flight at the airport going thru security when i realized i had it on me i had no choice but to throw it out so had to get another one	10

1	these are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps as such they 're 108 long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands men should use 180 wraps everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on amazon	10
0	ummm why should i pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book	10
0	the medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived it was very scuffed up and scratched it also had a flat spot on it i returned it for a replacement which i got and it was in the same condition also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before i would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it we also had the same experience above with the 6 lb medicine ball and the same outcome definitly not happy with it	10
1	i just switched from a suunto t6 to a t4 and this pc pod works seemless between the watch and pc it is about 2x a paper clip and with the usb connection it is easy to carry although a little pricy from the competition if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the t4 foot pod and pc pod work very well down side is the software which does not support mac come on suunto	10
1	this is a real good ramp i just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air ! overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major it is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time they are fun and you will have hours of fun ! ! ! \) \)	10
0	i take yoga in a gym the class starts as the aerobics session ends i bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot i expected more elastic they made my foot cramp during the class because i had worn them once i could not return them now i do not know what to do with them i should throw them out but i spent money on them	10
1	i had the original solid red victorinox that was borrowed and never returned \( it was about 10 years old and still going strong ! \) so i purchased this one i came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire amethyst and red for christmas gifts everyone loved them ! small in size but a real workhorse and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk it came in handy opening the boxes that were taped and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now i definitely recommend this product if you have very large hands or need a larger blade buy a larger knife otherwise this is the one you want	10

0	this pedometer is not very reliable it is very inaccurate in its count it counts a step at the littlest movement i put it on counted out a hundred steps and checked it and it said 260 just moving it to look at it recorded more steps if you want something really accurate spend more money	10
0	the quality of the construction was poor i would not recomend this to anyone	10
1	i 've tried lots of goggles these are my favorite i did n't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly and i remember the days when the one piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well these are adjustable strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit and it 's comfortable like the one piece goggles and has a no snag silicone strap	10
1	these are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and i also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops i am not a diabetic but i have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when i get it i use this or something else to get it back up fast so i can be comfortable this really works and tastes great too they really did well with this product i like to go geocaching and i get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when i need quick fuel	10
0	this bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing i used it for less than five mintues and broke it has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks the company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too the barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and i ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken i spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit anyone honestly that tells you differently is wrong	10
1	i purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong ! i use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect	10
0	not very bright for an led and guess what \? this is about 2 1 2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy toes ! given the picture shows a spike on it one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something well the spike is more like a thumbtack i realize the images are provided by the manufacturer so i do n't blame amazon but there is no excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this	10
0	this product is actually quite small even though is says mini i still expected it to be a little bit bigger also it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it the seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone	10

0	this was a very disappointing product amazon delivered it in great time but razor is very misleading about the quality of this product it is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it it is frustrating to be told by the razor customer service after the purchase that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood there goes the portability of it ! very disappointing !	10

1	i bought it through the target amazon store which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension \( by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit \) to me it was exactly as advertised a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well i do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device	10

1	i looked at many different variations of swiss army knife before i decided on this one i could n't be happier ! this has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs \( the screwdriver heads the small blade the scissors \) and it 's great for outdoor use at picnics camping or canoeing \( the saw blade the large knife the toothpick \) there are still a few tools i have n't used but overall this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money	10
0	i bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old he liked the boat well enough even played with it when it was sitting on dry land however in the water this boat is very tippy requiring two adult hands at all times not good if you have more than one kid and need that extra hand i bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer i would n't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat	10

0	do n't ever buy this it is a rip off and a gimmick your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one	10
0	i only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began it started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else very annoying ! also the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse while it is a low impact machine it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals this is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout i am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine do not waste your money	10

1	gloves are toasty perform as expected and are a sweet luxury after a long cold day on the slopes however the d sized batteries \( 1 per glove \) are considerably more bulky than what i expected most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 aa batteries but no just one bit fat chicken roastin' d sized battery good product but consider whether wearing the big ol' d 's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves or whether you 'll barely notice being bundled up and bulkified anyway may also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it 's really nippy out	10
0	this looks better on tv than it actually works the cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around when it unwinds it does so very slow and loses it 's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with \? what are you supposed to hit it with then \? these things you do n't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up do n't waste money on this item	10

0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14

0	i bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son 's fast growing hair he 's got thick hair that we like to keep buzzed short the first time i used the clippers he complained that they really pull at the hair i realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair i buzzed the little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair i 've decided to send it back reasonably priced but not worth the pain not recomended for thick hair	14
1	i love this product it is so well worth the money if you 're experiencing a skin problem easy to use portable no lotions or creams needed just my little leather case	14
1	this is the best bargain for your money pampers swaddlers are better than pampers even better than costco brand worth every penny	14
1	i'm a black male and everytime i would shave normally i would get irritated skin and ingrown hairs at first i 'd feel a little itch throughout the day and by the end of the day i 'd see these tiny little bumps with white heads \( about 10 20 of them \) that was before now after i apply the product i do n't have the itch nor do the tiny bumps come up anymore it just feels like i never had any hair on my face in the first place the only bad thing about this product is that it burns slightly but i do n't really care i mean it 's not like the product claims to be painless	14
1	i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued \( like i could hardly move \) i had been taking a general multi vitamin from a local warehouse store i started taking the nature 's plus source of life and i felt so much better my energy level has increased dramatically and i just feel good great quality product	14

0	it didnt work as good as the teflon curling iron i had a couple years ago it works just as good as a regular non teflon curling iron	14
0	this scale does not weigh correctly your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in i counted 6 different results within 5 minutes the last time i used it this is one of the least accurate scales i 've ever used spend the extra money to get a higher quality non digital scale	14
0	i cannot address the value of buying products from this manufacturer that 's for you to decide however this product performs noticably worse than its earth unfriendly alternatives clothes come out greyish and stains are not as well removed as with tide the other one i use but the decision is yours	14
1	nice mirror good magnification solid construction my only change would allow vertical adjustability to allow flexibility in positioning on the wall i had to move a picture to position it at the correct height	14
0	i had a good massaging heating pad that was great and i used it on my legs a lot thought i could replace it this one is not even in the ballpark absolutely useless i have been had	14
0	i bought this and it worked fine the first time that i used it granted it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom however i have tried it in my infant 's room 4 times this winter i used hot water salt to try to help it but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam maybe all of the steam energy is being used on the night light ! if you have your home 's thermostat set under 78 degrees do not waste your money on this item ! find something stronger to get you through the winter months	14
0	this is a very cheaply built product we had a hard time getting it to mist at all even though the instruction say fill it with water at least 1 inch above the misting device it took trial and error to find the exact right level that it would mist at when it did mist it would not get more than about 1 3 inch from the top so the mist never made it out of the bowl we did like the changing color lights	14
0	i would have given it zero stars but that is not an option it stopped working after about 10 minutes of static filled reception it was difficult to get a station and it was not a problem with the batteries run do n't walk away from this	14
0	design seems flawed a bit for the container when you pull the cord out it bumps the tank off sometimes the tank also seems a little loose when mounted i tried the newest ultra dental water pik type but it only lasted 1 month then began to leak water	14
0	picked this up to try out because of the ratings price did n't do a thing for me wipe it on let it haze and wipe it off no difference	14
1	we originally got this to replace the fan noise in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold the first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it we 've discovered it 's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night with the adjustability dials it 's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan it does n't however cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise especially for children	14
1	this is my first electric shaver and i am very pleased with the results use the trimmer to reduce the length of the hair and then use the cleancut to make it smooth no knicks no cuts ! ! ! i am pleased !	14
0	it never ceases to amaze me how often gillette comes out with new gimmicks to take more money from it 's loyal clientele the fusion is a classic example from overpriced shaving gel to a much overpriced razor which quite honestly gives you the same shave as a sensor excel do n't buy into the hype the fusion is an expensive joke of a product	14
0	the bath seat was easy to put together and satisfactory to use but some of the metal hardware that was provided for use in assembling the seat was not rust proof and rusted after several weeks of use it makes no sense to make a product used under water that contains metal parts that are not rust proof	14
1	the knots in my back my spots never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer one day i asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was he explained the concept i tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special the leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying strong pressure to them like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there i bought one the next day you do n't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots	14
1	i own an older dispensor from around 1999 and i was afraid that these filters would n't fit they do and seem to work fine i ca n't find a replace indicator on these new ones the older filters had a sliding arrow to show when to replace them i guess that i just have to replace it on a calendar basis they say the filters are good for 2 months	14
0	the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them and i could not get the hooks to work i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it and it failed far short of the maximum weight on the package in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures which i had to hang with other hardware	14
0	expensive and after three months of daily use i ca n't say it has helped my blood pressure i record my blood pressure every morning at the same time after getting up from nights sleep i use exercise equipment for 45 minutes after stretching exercises then breakfast and 15 minutes on resperate devise my blood pressure has n't changed significently in the last six months and i continue to take blood pressure medicine the resperate device was used for the first six weeks just before bedtime change in schedule has n't changed blood pressure measurments to any significant extent i continue to use the device because of the fortune spent on it but would n't consider buying it again	14
0	i have never used such an impactless \( if that is a word \) product there is absolutely no effect whatsoever not even remotely it is simply a waste of money and bottle i am terribly disappointed you are better off blowing air and water over your ingrown hair areas for better effect	14
0	this mister is not for continuous use had it for only 2 days and the bubbler weakened and barely gave out a mist but good as a lighting decor and ambience	14
1	i ordered these disposable pampers for my son they are great i ordered them and recieved free 2 day shipping	14
1	the razor and trimmer are both easy to use and give a nice clean shave i am very happy with this item	14
1	i loved it and guys really love it the smell is so fresh and clean	14
0	i had this for about 2 years and was not impressed it worked for a month or so and since then does nothing if you fill it up with water and then plug it in for several days the water level never goes down i 've tried cleaning it repeatedly and tried various things to make it work but apparently it 's just dead it was a cheap product you get what you pay for	14
1	it takes some getting used to but once you do you will love it it leaves my teeth cleaner than any toothbrush electric or other that i have ever used you feel at first like it is totally strange \( it is ! \) does n't take more than a few times using it to realize that it 's a great concept and so much faster than anything else i have no buyers remorse i just wish that changing the brushes on it were simpler so one brush could be shared with another person you really are best to have one per person with this one since changing the brush a lot is a hassle	14
1	i 've been using this scrub for a while it greatly improved the quality of the shave that i get i get a lot less irritation i 've also used a similar product from lancome \( more expensive \) and actually prefer nivea better	14
0	it worked quite nicely until after about 9 months the display just stopped working changed the batteries to no avail it 's very pretty but i have a less attractive old tanita that does body fat measurements which has been working for 5 years	14
0	this item intially fit very well but within 5 weeks i bit a hole in the right side and it came apart and i only wear it 4 6 hours a night this product is very poor because it is expensive if you have to replace them every 6 weeks or so i like the design and it does n't cut up my mouth but i ca n't be replacing it every other month	14
1	the monitor is relatively cheap easy to use and mostly accurate the one gripe i have is that if i take my pulse 3 times in one minute or less the rate can range by up to 40 points ! usually this is not a problem i tend to check it 3 times and average the 3 which is sufficient for my purposes	14
1	pedometer is great ! easy to use accurate highly recommend it	14
0	i bought 8 size d 's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips wrong answer i was able to play 2 1 2 cds before my box was out of juice game over i realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around but these batteries were fresh off the charger when i left i figured they 'd at least last into the night but they were finished before sundown do n't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices i got fooled fool me once shame on you we ca n't get fooled again	14
1	there are several listings for this item in different versions before making a decision check out the other versions you will see many different reviews overall it seems to be as long as you use the product as intended it works ! you can see my full review under zeno pro pink	14
0	they 're ok but definately not as absorbent as the overnight diapers my son soaks through if he urinates during the night	14
1	item was received in perfect shape it is a wonderful item and a great buy	14
0	this may work well but the cuff size is not as it is in the description it says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches not even close my arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far sure you can get the cuff to go around your arm but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly and there was just no way to even come close	14
0	the only reason that i am writing this review is because i am on line now looking for a new trimmer i bought this gem less than a year ago and was not satisfied then tonight i'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out the extra cutting heads are all but worthless i would never recommend this p o s to anybody i wish i could give it 0 stars	14
1	i do a lot of walking as well as standing on my feet all day for work receiving this product as a test drive was fabulous ! i never knew a cream could work so well at relieving my tired aching feet and restoring my skin i 'd definitely recommend this product	14
0	we bought this at suggestion of our dentist however it is difficult to use extremely messy and the on off button on handle is difficult to press we used it a couple of times but have not used it since because of messiness and inconvenience our neighbors bought the same model tried to use it a few times and have not tried to use it since for the same reasons we gave save your money and go back to flossing !	14
1	this curling iron works well it heats quickly and i'm very satisfied	14
1	bought it works really good such a fun thing to have laying around and was very pleased well worth the 50 it costed me at brookstone	14
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	14
1	i like guru because it has a more natural feeling towards your body after drinking monster all day my body felt like a mess \( from the many unnatural chemicals it does to your body \) there are so many energy drinks out there that have loads of chemicals its harder to find stuff like guru and bawls	14
1	this monitor is so easy to use and more convenient than going to the grocery store it saves the readings in memory so if i do n't have a pen and paper handy i can retrieve the info later it even shows the time the reading was taken	14
0	yes that 's right this worked for me for only one day what a disappointment	14
1	my last braun razor was model 6550 which i purchased 7 years ago the braun 8975 is a pleasure using quick and close shave the technology has come a long way i have always used braun and this is by far the best yet	14

1	they had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and i stayed at and i fell in love with it ! i had to have one of my own and thanks to amazon i was able to find one this is an excellent product my husband installed it easily and i would never be without one again one side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good lol and eyelining is a breeze though he would never admit it my husband uses also \( trimming mustash nose hairs \( eewww \) shaving etc \) great product order one you will not be dissapointed !	14
1	i 've been relying on this lotions for over a decade of the many i 've tried it 's the only one that provides both immediate dryness relief and long lasting moisturizing some may find the initial glycerin slickness to be excessive especially on hands but if you have skin as dry as mine you 'll tolerate a minute or two of greasiness for the softness and comfort that lasts for hours these comments are for neutrogena emulsion only neutrogena body lotion did not work well for me	14
1	i 've used creatine as a strength aid to supplement my lifting for years this is the real stuff at the best price i 've ever seen	14
1	while a little dubious i am know a believer really helps me get motivated and stay energized focused for my workouts start with a single scoop and adjust as needed	14
0	the product does not work as it is shown on tv there are very specific instructions on how it works and it is not so easy the item was a gift that is now just gathering dust	14
1	the refills were easy to order fit my brush perfectly it 's a lot easier ordering on line received in home rather than trying to find the merchandise in a store	14
0	i have tried other products before and this one gets the whitest results the fastest however i was in so much pain about 5 hours afterwards that it even hurt to swallow advil i used sensodyne and a flouride mouthwash to try to help but nothing seemed to work the taste is n't bad and i used the bleach with my own trays that i had made by my dentist so it did n't leak out or touch my gums my teeth were n't sensitive while i was using it or even right afterwards but later in the day if you have sensitive teeth i do not recommend this product unless you are willing to go through the pain	14
1	this an excellent tool to self massage yourself it is very steady and very controllable you can really reach in with it i tried different canes and this is the best one buy it for yourself and your friends and they will love it ! do n't forget to buy the instructional dvd it is really helpful in learning the proper way to use it	14
0	the bed lift system is ok if all you want to do is sit up in bed and read however i did not like the way it bounced when trying to sleep on it and the edges or sides would collapse if you were n't centered in the bed	14
0	i bought this product in rite aid unfortunately it irriates my face they are scamming people just to buy this product instead of repairing my face this product damage my face there are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since i start using this now i need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product if i knew this will happen i will not waste my money to buy this product	14
1	this is an exceptional value for an exceptional dryer i have paid alot more for more well known brand named dryers i have long thick hair and this product dries my hair in half the time other dryers have done in the past buy this hair dryer you wo n't be sorry	14
0	this thing is horrible cumbersome to use and does nothing i have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor it removes a little bit of dirt but does n't actually clean a rug carpet i'm giving it one star because amazon wo n't let me rate it 0	14
1	this is a great product a friend told me about it i finally decided to get one i had bleeding gums in two weeks of regular use bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great just be careful when using the water jet side you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth or it will spray all over the place	14
0	sturdy enough for the price but no power replaced original battery with a new duracell still fuctioned like the battery was drained like i mentioned before what do you expect for the price	14
1	a friend of mine used to meet me for lunch while boasting a beautiful glowing face from a 50 00 facial she had just received this product \( even after the 1st use \) produced the same results i never had to leave my home my skin always goes through hell during the winter months when its continually exposed to artificial heat my skin feels looks like i 've lost about 7 years time i'm very very pleased with olay i 've used their total effects lotion for years i did purchase the regenerist serum to apply after using the kit this is an excellent exfoliant hands down the best skin regenerating product i 've ever used	14
0	please careful about this grooming kit i bought one week before and when i turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work this product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not this lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair also this can not be used for continuous use if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge	14
1	i have dry course hair that certainly gets even drier in the colorado climate i have used this product on and off for 10 years and just love the way it defines and adds shine to my hair i can see if you had fine hair that this product would not be a good thing ! i always have to remember that it 's the anti humectant that i like not the humectant the humectant version does nothing for my hair and i have purchased it on occasion by mistake this stuff smells great too ! makes styling a snap	14
1	i took my unit to a monthly meeting for seniors their machine broke i took mine as a replacement they liked it so well they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings they like all the different aspects of the machine a suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet write down the date the numbers from the machine \?	14
0	product does n't really do anything more than blow air it does n't appear to do anything with the ultraviolet light	14
1	the clippers are excellent quality and cut well we have a poodle that has very thick hair if you take your time these clippers do a wonderful job	14
1	this hair dryer is truly a professional salon type dryer many dryers are advertised as such but this one lives up to that reputation very sleek beautiful coloring and easy to handle with turbo feature this was a surprise \( turbo \) which i'm enjoying coupled with the smooth and strong drying the sound is even pleasant not too loud and it works quickly \( especially since i have very thick hair \) i would recommend this dryer as an excellent buy for the inexpensive price aj in n	14
0	broke after 5 days i used it the way it was meant to be used cleaned it nightly etc i had read a review that said theirs broke after a short time and ignored it i wish i had n't this is junk	14
1	nv diet pills are working great for me i lost 8lbs in a month ! ! ! they work as long as you eat healthy and exercise regularly while taking the pills it is n't a miracle pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and do n't work out of course nothing is going to happen they really do control hunger because i take 2 a day and one day i was busy and forgot to take my 2nd pill and i was starving looking to eat anything and everything in sight	14
0	this was a terrible product i got little sores everywhere i used it believe me i will only use it once wish i had my money back	14

0	i had heard that chocoleans were effective but i was very disappointed they taste good but did n't satisfy my hunger or my sweet tooth about the same as eating a piece of dark chocolate i wound up gaining weight while using these	14
0	i 've used this trimmer only twice but my initial opinion will lead me to return it when trimming my moustache it 's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose i used it to cut my sons hair but it kept binding up and pulling his hair i ultimately gave up and returned to the old oster clippers i have they buzzed right through with no problem i 'll be sending this item back	14
1	having previously owned battery powered travel razors i was always disappointed with their power and battery life after all what 's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced \? the braun 370 bk was a pleasant surprise however powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing i also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost a great piece of tech at a good price	14
1	i have owned this pulse meter for approximately 2 weeks and i find it to be accurate but it takes a while for it to give a reading the first few times i used it it took over a minute to tell me my pulse however the manual does state that when you become used to the correct positioning of your finger on the sensor it will give a result faster so far this is true as within the last 3 days i have received readings within 10 seconds consistently considering the price it was a good purchase	14
0	this one is too small for a bedroom just like a toy i returned this one and reordered sunbeam 701 000 ultrasonic humidifier which is much bigger generally speaking the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones	14
0	i bought this to save time it took me longer to stem press one shirt then ironing by conventional iron it was too small i end up returing it which cost me 25 in shipping cost both ways	14
1	my wife loves this ! it was not too expensive and she really has been very appreciative esp for her eye makeup	14

0	one i started using the shaver it fell apart it has plastic tabs to hold it together and they just do n't work the shaver is a waste of money	14
0	please verify with amazon if they will ship your product i ordered mine 6 weeks back and i havent recieved it till now i wonder when they will send me the same	14
1	excellent product works well only problem is that the container holding water could be bigger	14
0	this pad barely got warm it 's going back ! since this is the same complaint as with another sunbeam model i tried i suspect it is n't defective but intentional probably for legal reasons but should n't a heating pad actually have some heat to it \? \?	14
1	kama sutra massage oil in the 8oz bottle is really good stuff ! keeps the skin so smooth and the girlfriend happy lol just make sure you warm it up alittle before squirting it on you will live longer	14
0	this product come with a washer that keep causing the leak it works fine for few weeks then the washer become worn out and it keep causing the leak now i just leave it in my garage and ca n't return it or use it very bad investment	14
1	i love this item i received it as a gift and now use it every single day my hair dries so much faster after having been wrapped up in this that 's great b c now i do not have to blow dry as much so my hair seems to be getting a lot healthier only complaint would be that it does not stay wrapped very well not sure if it 's the material or the size but nonetheless it still works great	14
1	i have nothing bad to say it gets hot enough it was cheap it seems well made the cover is washable it 's just what i was looking for	14
0	this is another example of a horrible waste of time and money our emjoi products have never lasted longer than 6 months without needing repair and that brings around another problem emjoi customer service and repair service you 'll want to avoid both better yet avoid emjoi and avoid the total headache not only are emjoi products cheap they are painful to use	14
0	i 've had this straightener for about 3 months i loved it at first but now it 's a love hate relationship the gold plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use the effect my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff ! to make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates i gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair something that is hard to do ! this is the second store brand straightener i 've purchased with poor results save your and buy a professional model from a hairdresser it 's cheaper in the long run	14
0	i 've used the cardiochek 6 times and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor 's office during the same period my cholesterol levels according to the doctor 's tests are always around 200 with the cardiochek they vary by as much as 90 points it is a lot of trouble \( and expensive \) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total cholesterol hdl cholesterol and triglycerides no test strips are included in the package when i purchased the cardiochek the box says includes check strips but those are something other than test strips	14
1	i had a horrible cold felt like complete but i had to work this little two ounce vitamin b shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and i was able to get some work done there really is no crash and the taste is n't that bad it tastes like a melted freeze pop note it may give you the jitters if you drink it on an empty stomach	14
1	great features ! probably the best pedometer out there for the money the only reason i give 4 vice 5 stars is that i think the one i bought for my mom \( same brand and model \) is slightly more accurate a great way to track your fitness overall	14
0	i ordered this scale for a blind senior citizen the english speaking voice has a british accent and is difficult to understand the scale wobbles when you stand on it making you feel unstable especially for someone with impaired eyesight	14
0	the seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable the extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support do n't measure up the snaps that should hold the ends together do n't work basically it would be ok if it came with a soft cover	14
0	i got one of these to help me after i had major surgery i have better than average hand and arm strength but i found this particular model to be hard to operate \( i ca n't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it \) normal sized cans \( like soup or beans \) slipped out of its pitiful grip i wound up using it just to roll things to myself when i dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash this is definitely a lightweight too light for much real use i should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more	14
1	this product is so good for you i sprinkle it on my cereal salads in yogurt etx a nice nutty flavor and the health benefits are outstanding i highly recommend this product	14
0	this product did not work i was faithful for 1 month with no results	14
0	please note that any electric razor requires at least 10 days use in order to properly condition the skin so that you can have a good shave with it i have used the panasonic es8043 for about 20 days now and it still tears my face to shreds every time i use it stay clear of this device unless you have stubble like a porcupine it 's like french kissing jaws the worst part is that no matter how bad you let it tear at you you still have stubble left that no amount of choppi shaving will remove seriously this must be one of those devices left over from the spanish inquisition	14
1	necessary replacement brush heads to maintain correct oral hygeine with rotary braun electric toothbrush i foung amazon com 's price for this item cheaper than costco or sam 's club ! ! !	14
1	i got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and i thought they 'd improve upon the mach3 well they did ! this turbo brand of mach 3 is actually much better his shave lasts longer the blades last longer and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave i choose this one over that mach3 power vibrating blade because i do n't know a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion haha he 's very happy with it and likes the shave and speaking about money if the shave and blades last longer than before it 's a great value ! highly suggested ! !	14
1	i like this product a lot my hair type is curly and frizzy specially after the hair gets dried up naturally after the head bath i used this product and my hair looks good now it looks smooth and straight now and i can feel the softness when i touch my hair i definitely will recommend this product to my friends	14

1	this was bought as a gift for my dad who has limited mobility it 's easy for him to use easy to handle and gives him a great shave he really likes it	14
1	by far the best hair straightener i have purchased i have spent so much time money and effort searching for a straightener that delivers results i can now say that i have found it i bought the 2 turbo and it gets the job done on my course naturally curly hair one of my all time favorite purchases i never travel without it	14
0	like the reviewer below my dryer also stopped working within a short period it was never dropped or misused after about a month it simply refused to turn on when plugged in now there is a decent warranty for the product however with the money you spend on shipping and the 4 they request for handling return shipping buying another inexpensive dryer starts to sound like a better deal i do n't know if the other reviewer and i got the only two lemons but since we both found our way to amazon with this review i would n't recommend the product to other buyers	14
0	advil liquigels are excellent for headaches i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in 1 or 2 weeks \( as advertised \) i ordered this product more than 2 months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store \( like i had to eventually do when i ran out \)	14
1	have n't had to clean it yet and it keeps the humidity level in out daughter 's room between 41 and 53 we have had it for 3 months now and no problems at all works as advertised and worth every penny	14
1	easy on the back and shoulders as this is very light it does a good enough surface job until the weekend vaccuuming my 2 year old daughter loves to use it to help mommy ! i bought this in a drug and discount store for 13 95 it 's worth that	14
0	the good the massage function works fine no problems with the performance and the battery holds a good charge the bad how much money is saved in construction by using thecheapest foam padding imaginable \? the ugly the 'pebbled vinyl' material on the arms is already separating after six months maybe a cheaper material could have been found but i doubt it overall good in theory but very poor in execution if some real quality were put into the product it would rate potentially 5 stars 'til then you 've been warned	14
0	frankly suggest not to buy will regret a lot after buying ooooo aaaa ouchhhh tooo painful and hair starts growing in a weeek and taking very loooooooooooooong timeee to finish one hand dont buy	14
0	it makes glasses stain and i return it within 1 week	14
1	good product the pressure could be a little stronger with the sponge head it has a nice scent and when the crystals had leaked upon arrival i had excellent customer service from the company to replace it	14
0	my husband purchased the pedometer with fm radio for me i loved it and used it non stop for about a week after a week the battery case top fell off so i could not keep the batteries in the fm radio worked only once i thought i had a short in the headset good idea but really did not perform last for the money	14
1	amazon still has n't quite figured out how to ship these mine arrived with one case broken open although the whole thing had been stuffed in a clear garbage bag	14
1	this has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use it really does n't start until your arm is in the correct position letting you know by beeping when you 've got it right the display is large and easy to read and understand i definitely would recommend this	14
0	i do n't know if it works or not i just received it and all i get on it is a low battery reading	14
0	this is a very lousy product the lighting around the mirror is absolutely useless when you turn the light on it seems like you 're still looking at the mirror with no light awful product eventhough it 's cheap but it does n't even worth a dime	14
0	amazon is claming great entry level charger system charges four aa aaa nimh batteries in 6 10 hours includes four 2300mah nimh aa batteriesit is only 1800mah which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards while if it was as amazon claims it would have been a nice step up shame on amazon oversight or misrepresentation charger is cheaply made it can charge 4 aa or only 2 aaa poor design the charger that came with my camera can do 4 aaa go figure get something else	14
1	i have medium colored hair and i 've used this trimmer many times it shaves away the hair just fine for me you know need to know how to get to all the hair if your hair is so coarse that this trimmer does n't work you i 'd recommend waxing ! fast effective good angling	14
1	we use the zbars for breakfast and my kids love them ! i love them too as they 're organic contain no trans fat no refinded sugar or flour they 're yummy and healthy	14
0	i complete disagree with the previous review on that sonicare is superior i 've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and braun sonic complete is by far the best however this unit is nothing like sonic complete the sonic energy is completely in the handle it 's like holder a vibrator the real sonic complete channels the energy to the brush head you are probably better more with one of the other two models of vitality that uses rotational brush heads	14
0	i ordered 2 of these only 1 came with the ac plug that was disappointing	14
1	i bought this as a trial product because the other stuff that i bought did n't work as what they advertise it but this dusters picks up the dust instead of pushing to another place this refills is quite cheap and it make my cleaning job much easier	14
0	the off on switch on this product is very difficlut to use i am not able to turn off or on with one hand and find it very difficult to turn on with two hands	14
0	the amount of time resulted in minimal results i was very disappointed	14
0	worked alright for a few months i was n't especially pleased with the shave quality i e skin irritation hair pulls i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads it did n't the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair was n't easy and resulted in breakage no doubt due to the cheap plastic used never again	14
1	clean and crisp defined and smooth i use burberry by burberry for all occassions but it is great for the evening it has woodsy notes that remind me of autumn i am very picky about my fragrances and i only use two regularly eau d'issey by issey miyake is my main scent but i do use burberry sometimes on occassion and i love it thats it	14
0	i know that this product works for some but for me it did not that is why i decided to return it wahl makes great products but this product was not for me my skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it	14
1	this is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful	14
1	so far this dryer is working great ! another brand did n't last 1 year so i hope this one lasts longer	14
1	have had several norelco razors over the years this is the closest shave i have ever gotten from any electric razor and it is also the quietest only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave highly recommend	14
0	does not maintain water temp splashes all over at the proper water level rollers hurt noisy weak vibrations i would n't want one for 5	14
1	used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids kids will be kids but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push easy to mount and easy to use	14
0	top of the line \( april 2005 \) d cell nimh batteries have 11 000 mah compared to this one 2 200 mah \( they cost 16 bucks but 10 000 mah battery costs six bucks \) top of the line aa nimh batteries have capacity of 2500 mah top of the line nicad d cell batteries have 5000 mah capacity \( costs around five bucks \) i thought that nimh was more capable than nicad true but not in this case so what are we gettting here \? higher aa battery capacity in d cell case this battery is overpriced for what it delivers	14
0	the glasses are well made but i found them awkward to use they did n't fit comfortably and it took quite a bit of time to get them on the gimmick sounded cool but did n't work well for me every head is different so maybe they 'll work better for you	14
0	i 've got this meter a month ago i intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise but i 've never been able to do so ! at rest the meter gives a reading after several attempts but often inaccurate you have to stay still as a statue for 10 20 seconds to get a reading now i'm using it as an exercise watch stopwatch	14
0	broke after two uses not worth the time to put back together	14
1	i bought this for my mom for christmas i have the same one i take mine on every trip i go on she always says she needs one my whole life i have been a light sleeper and now i sleep through almost everything \( sometimes even my alarm \)	14
1	i purchased the revlon facial steamer this was my first purchase on line and i am very satisfied with the steamer and the service i received from amazon the steamer is great i use it when i give myself a facial i have not use the nail kit yet	14
0	not really an improvement over standard mach 3 cartridges and certainly not worth the price jump the shave quality still does not match that by an old fashioned safety razor	14
0	chair is not at all what it 's advertised as does not massage just vibrates and makes you feel sick compatible with sitting on a washing machine	14
1	i bought this dryer based on other people 's review it is an excellent dryer the air flow is strong and it dries my medium to long hair faster than my old one ever did i did n't give it 5 stars because it is a bit heavier than most dryers however since it dries my hair fast my arms do n't mind the weight \) 2 thumbs up in my book ! !	14
1	this creatine works very good on me building muscle it has no flavor i recommend it with a good diet ! ! see results in weeks !	14
0	tried this product for 2 weeks it did improve the clarity and softness but i found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well seemed to have a sticky feel since then i found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called microdermx by nikkel holistic skincare this product performs like magic it is not too scratchy and i can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like i 've been slapped with a wire brush i can do the treatment 2 3x 's a week \( like your supposed to \) but i also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before it is a magical product bette hampton chicago i	14
0	they are a waste of time and money they put goo in your mouth and not as much on your teeth after a week my teeth are the same color as when i started	14
1	this product perfrorms as expected and very easy to clean with almost not maintenance it also has an adjust dial for the humidity which gives you some control love the machin	14
1	these are great glasses easy to put on and take off and are there around your neck waiting for you to use them i saw them on the csi ny coroner on tv and had to find some amazon was the place to go	14
1	compared to the first humidifier i got from walmart this cute cow is absolutely quiet and working just perfect oh well i just got it yesterday so it 's too early to say perfect but considering others' reviews i am pretty confident that i am gonna love it longer than at the first sight the only thing is i do n't know where to put it the power cord has to be plugged into a wall socket and the cord is not long i am a little concern that the nearby stuff such as my wood chair or chest or even other electrical appliances will get damaged by surrounded with the emitting mist all the time	14
1	this is the best reacher i have ever used i am in a wheelchair due to ms and have used various types over the past 6 years but the quality and ease of use is much better with this	14
0	i purchased the product used it for 2 days and it has not worked since the compnay has yet to respond to my request for return and amazon excepts no liabilty needless to say i wasted money	14
1	these batteries work well they do n't last as long as normal batteries but the ability to recharge them makes them more than worth the additional costs if you have kids with toys these are a must	14
1	i use this with my m3 turbo and some kiehl 's closeshavers squadron ultimate brushless shave cream white eagle for my daily morning shave it 's the best combination for thick tough stubble	14
0	worthless motor is loud and heating not noticable in 10 minutes hot water became luke warm	14
1	this omron blood pressure monitor is ok but not as good in my opinion as my old one from the same company this one does n't print out results although it does store them also the cuff is very stiff and cumbersome	14
1	this is a great lumbar support for crappy car and office chairs also check out elaine petrone 's miracle balls which you can also use in the car and for other things the support is sturdy and has a mesh back which helps to keep you cool and comfortable a great deal for the cost	14
1	also bought as a gift but i tried it ! very relaxing and much more affordable than the ones you see in the mall	14
0	the price is too high considering the ijoy 550 model is only us 599 99 at sharper image	14
0	the nose trimmer works well but the electric razor not well at all does not cut at all i would suggest the nose trimmer but not the razor the cost was a little high for the product	14
1	its a very nice little fountain the lighting on the ceiling is really cool and the water noises are adjustable depending on how you arrange the rocks it does n't have near enough rocks so i'm going to go and get some but i think once i fill it up a little more it 'll look a lot better too i'm satisfied i actually bought another one	14
0	paid a fortune for this thing and it stopped working after 2 uses	14
1	it does what it advertises the bodyfat readings do fluctuate but that 's normal it gives you a good general idea of how much bodyfat you have and it gives a simple reading of whether your bmi with your body fat is low normal high too high i got it for about 25 bucks so good buy	14
0	the flexible arm is not stiff enough to support the dry weight of the showerhead this is the most pathetic product that i have seen in decades	14
1	i bought this toothbrush a month ago and have been very satistfied with it the battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you ca n't get from a manual toothbrush the price is good the battery life is good and the battery door is very easy to open ! i would buy it again !	14
1	my mother in law thought it was reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these because she got one that has ocean sounds birds ect but all those other machines have that creepy digital sound for white noise and the waves inevitably break and the birds stop chirping as soon as the car alarm goes off in the street this is the only sound we need ! we bought it for our 3 month old daughter because we live in a noisy part of the city and our neighbors kept waking her up she slep great from day one now we use it as part of her bedtime ritual bath jammies book sleepy machine and off to sleep she goes	14
1	i have had this heating pad for several months and have never had a problem with it it gets very hot warm very fast and is very comforting i use it on my neck and shoulders to help relax the muscles that cause some headaches i would recommend this product to anyone i'm purchasing another one for my stepfather as a gift	14
0	i 'd give this machine 5 stars if 1 \) it was n't so expensive and 2 \) it was n't so darn small it barely fits anything inside it works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two but that 's about it anything else just wo n't fit and the design of the inside with the piece in the middle makes it even more restricting in my personal opinion this product is not worth the money i am so disappointed because it sounded so perfect but its just not	14
0	does n't thiss say it all \? screw on threads failed my shake spilled i threw it away and use my martini shaker instead	14
0	its super cheap does not work at all will struggle with the thinnest of hairs stay away ! !	14
0	light didnt turn off mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall and mirror became foggy !	14
0	first know this it is a trimmer not a shaver ! with the included height attachment your bound to have a little fuzz still left without the attachment you get closer results but still very visible hair lines i am quite disapointed with the product because it runs on two aaa batteries the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles this lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you i would certainly not recommend this product but might be necessary if you 'll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild	14
0	if you think you are buying the old met rx bars by the same flavors you are in for a very very bad surprise the old bars had better taste and a almost cake like consistency these were so sticky that i could pick up papers just by touching them after eating one also i could n't get past the taste even the color is different i never finished the bar and i used to eat one a day \( years ago \) i gave the entire box away for free i will not buy these again until the go back to their old recipe	14
0	these are the bulkiest leakiest diapers i 've ever used ! even though they do n't have bleach there is still tons of pesticide used in cotton production plus these are n't even made from recycled materials	14
0	this little machine is not worth the cost of the plastic to make it i assumed since wahl has a long time history of manufacturing grooming products that this would be a quality item was i ever wrong this trimmer is constructed poorly and does n't cut hair it will be heading to the trash	14
1	i found this blood pressure meter easy to use and quite accurate when checked against my doctors readings keeping the readings in memory made it very easy to keep my doctor inform of the results the size of the cuff is very important so be sure to order the right size for your arm as the wrong size will give inaccurate results this is true in the doctors office also my blood pressure dropped several points in the doctors office on his machine just by changing the size of the cuff this is an excellent monitor i could n't be happier with it it is nice to be able to use it with batteries too	14
1	i really like this product it 's very dry and windy here and my lips have been very chapped the neutrogena has helped 100 when nothing else worked ! ! i 'll definitely buy this product !	14
1	its a freakin wet nap what else can i say \? not much to critique here i live in a small town their kind of hard to find so amazon to the rescue pros 1 style \( square \) 2 looks it does n't shout hey i'm a wet nap 3 shape it stays put in my truck does n't roll around 4 does a great job of what its intended to do nothiing more cons 1 non	14
1	it is really great ! ! ! sure it does hurt but not any more than waxing i do not shave because i get cut very easily this is a great alternative to expensive waxing even when i have more hair it works i would buy this product again and again	14
1	good for dust storms in desert like environments great for looking suave very convenient for easy on off	14
0	these bars arrive smashed melting and stale taste like cardboard with dried blueberrie jam spread around on them awfu	14
0	i am amazed that all these so called health foods will add artery clogging palm kernel oil as an ingredient do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil cocoa butter and anything hydrogenated ! ! no matter how many organic things are added to it for many years now it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease the world health organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases	14
0	would work great except this does n't fit my new waterpik ultra \( wp 100 \)	14
1	i like this cutter i can use it by itself or with its accessaries even when the batteries are low i can still nip those little overnight hairs works for me !	14
1	i bought this straightner at walmart for about the same price found on amazon and i really like it i bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does i wanted a chi but i could n't pass this one up for the price i 've only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well a good product for the price ! !	14
1	this is a great little dryer if you travel or just for home use well worth the price cookiema	14
0	i bought this product thrilled with the thought that i could use an epilator in the shower even though that 's possible the very last thing this product does is remove hair at least with the epilator head the shaving head works fairly well but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better i ca n't believe panasonic thinks they 'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective	14
0	i bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three so i thought one of them might actually be hot instead the highest setting is warm to the touch not hot this may be a lawsuit friendly reality with heating pads today i 've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago \( i had that one for 10 years the sunbeam replacement i bought prior to this one lasted 2 and was n't hot \)	14
1	i bought one of these to squeege the water out of my past shoulder length hair it works great ! i gotta admit it 's just big enough for my head and i have a teeny little cranium so normal adults would probably prefer to buy the extra large size towel \( which is n't really all that large	14
0	what a waste of money not only was it just average in size but it was made of incredibly flimsy really cheap plastic	14
1	wonderful for getting all of your trigger points in your back especially but also in your neck and feet your body feels so relaxed after using the theracane	14
0	oprah winfrey and kevin costner the leading medical researchers in america think this is a great break through well gee if they like it you must too there is no scientific basis other than the nice school teachers guarantee that this works after you pay 5 6 bucks for some fizzing tablets that taste kind of good you might think something is happening well it probably is in your psyche if that and kevin costner testimonials do it for you then go ahead ca n't seem to find the guarantee on their web site other than they will do their darndest to improve the product and you 'll be the first to benefit	14
1	there 's nothing like grabbing a warm totally sanitized toothbrush i have used this for years after i saw the inventor on 20 20 i had to try it out it works great ! its like using a new toothbrush everyday well worth it	14
0	i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list	14
1	i bought two of these for my son hoping to wean him out of pull ups at night without having to strip the whole bed when there is an accident this pad is definitely leakproof the only con is that even though it says it has an anti slip backing that is not the case i have tried it with jersey sheets and flannel sheets but it does move alot and get bunched up so i do end up having to strip the bed every now and then because the pad moved during the night if i had it to do over again i would definitely buy the pad with the tuck under flaps	14
1	as soon as i got this item i tried it out right away i will agree the battery cover is rather flimsy but that 's a minor point the real issue is whether it could do what it claims to do take down mosquitos and flys sure enough i killed 5 mosquitos after sitting outside for just a few minutes i also took down a housefly without any sweat this is a great device as mosquitos are a real problem where i'm at and it sucks being held hostage indoors by insects no more an issue	14
0	this thing is a cheap piece of plastic and for the same price you can get the larger nice rock fountain that i have owned and know for a fact works well i can hardly hear the sound of the rain over the whirring of the motor it has a nice design in terms of look and it 's compact i also enjoy the lights for ambiance but for relaxation this thing has brought me more grief in 3 days than it 's worth	14
0	we have three of these humidifiers the elephant the penguin and the cow have had them for 6 months or so in the last two weeks both the penguin and cow have stopped working all together and the elephant is the sole survivor when we got them i thought they were amazing quiet and did the job now i am deciding if i should go out and buy two more or pick another brand oh and be careful i think the steam from my sons killed his dvd player on his tv as it gets caked with the white stuff	14
0	like the fading in of light would like the sound effects if they worked ! out of box the sound effects did not work now have to mess with calling the manufacturer to fix or get it replace such a hassle	14
0	nothing but problems with unit since i received it either it did not work when i went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again never had the same weight reading twice ! the only reason i rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less	14
0	if you have the philip 's sonicare brand electric toothbrush do n't buy this unit they do not fit in slots i had to return mine and am out shipping handling return shipping charges just an fyi if your electric brush head is any bigger than a standard size toothbrush \( diameter \) do n't buy it either it wo n't fit they do have a model esa302 that works with the sonicare but it is alot larger	14
1	the satinelle ice epilator does exactly what it is supposed to do remove hair quickly and efficiently by the root what an advantage ! hair does not reappear as quickly as it does shaving and when it does it is not the sharp stubble that happens with shaving i do n't think it hurts much though some spots may be a bit more sensitive than others the trick then is to simply lift it up off of the skin and stop momentarily i am very happy with this product	14
1	clif bars are amoung the best tasting energy bars i have ever tried they may not pack as many calories or grams of protein as other brands but there have been times where i could not even finish a competeing bar because of dismal taste or texture	14
0	but leaves a lot to be desired in practice just get a small electric or hand crank food processor this is not worth your time	14
0	do n't buy this ! i regret that i did n't listen to the people who left feedbacks the craftmanship for this item is very bad not only the product was made of cheap plastic it was missing a screw too i would not recomment this product	14
0	it 's good for its purpose but not resistant the lock that close the ball broke in the first use when i tried to open the other one worked fine it 's a cheap plast material could be better and more resistant but for now it 's ok since there is no other solutions for my bras besides this product is for medium and small bras who has large sizes will have difficult to fit the bra in the produc	14
0	having owned several panasonic wet dry shavers over a 20 year period i can with authority say that this model is a big disappointment the battery life is outstanding but that 's because the motor speed is so slow it 's not using much juice and with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor the next time i wo n't pinch pennies the higher priced models from panasonic are worth the price difference	14
0	it puts out a cloud of water vapor and it 's not all that noisy but i had no idea i 'd be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart wiping it down trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down refilling the tank twice a day and wondering why this humidifier does n't have an automatic shuftoff in case i forget to turn it off at least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find however this is too much like an unwanted hobby so i 'll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room	14
0	the ice ring used to keep the salad cold burst the first time i put it in the freezer ! evidently the plastic did not allow for adequate expansion when the gel froze so the seam burst and the liquid dripped out when it thawed ! in addition to that my soup was luke warm at lunchtime	14
1	these bars are absolutely fantastic they are very nutritious and have a good amount of protein \( 20g \) they taste pretty good far better than most bars i prefer the builder bar cookies and cream flavor to that of the clif bar flavor out of the flavors my current favorite is the cookies and cream next being the peanut butter and then chocolate a chocolate mint flavor has just been released but i have yet to try it i recommend these bars to anyone looking for a healthy snack or needing protein for working out	14
0	this straightener is great for thin hair but not for thick i myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy the best hair straighteners out there are about 1 quot thick or less and they normally have glass plates so if you have thick hair spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality	14
0	nice idea for all of us office workers but the main backing is too soft to provide any real lumbar support furthermore the movable lumbar support is made of the same soft material and is too small and not thick enough to provide any real support i am looking for something else	14
0	i bought these for my dad for christmas and they did not fit his head they did n't even fit mine and i have an average size head another thing they did not look cool at all they were ridiculous looking nothing like the photoshopped pictures	14
0	not the pumps described even though i tried everything else i found that taking whey protein isolate at 200grams per day worked better at giving me a pump during my workouts	14
1	i gave this to a bearded man for christmas to my knowledge he has used it only once with no complaints was nice for the main reason he had no electrical outlet in bathroom and had to drag large drop cord from another room to use old one this one is so convenient and i am sure he enjoys it purchasing was a breeze thank yo	14
1	i bought this for my husband he had a plantars wart on the bottom of his foot that was removed but became a callus that gave him pain emu oil is the first thing that softened it and it is better than it has ever been and he had suffered with it for years	14
1	i loved this product really leaves my hair really straight without even blow drying ! ! i have curly hair and it worked pretty well my hair was smooth and shiny i'm very happy with my straightener	14
1	the product is very good do not misunderstand me although it is not as good as the same produt when we bought it ten years ago the curls tend to stay put less time compared with the former hair curler tubes but still we strongly recommend them against heat activated tubes it 's a good buy	14
1	bought this for use by my husband while he was in a nursing home and i used it to shave and cut his hair with while he was there no hair on him or pillows or sheets this is wonderful for anyone that does not want a mess while trimming or cutting hair i also used it on the tougher part of his beard wonderful item	14
1	i agree with the previous reviewer i have used this brush for years ! it was recommended to me by a hairdresser and i will never use a different brush unless you have fine thin hair you will love this brush ! ! !	14
1	out of the 3 flavors available this one is the favorite of both my boys \( 4yrs and 7yrs \) but no matter what flavor its a snack they both will eat and enjoy !	14
0	was initially impressed with the backrest however because the straps are not adjustable it dose n't stay in place the one snap is not sufficient for holding the backrest in place	14
0	we recently bought the same model dispenser but in the satin finish from the first only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps did n't work \( yes we followed the instructions carefully \) two months later another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable instead of this loser try the dispenser 71450 classic iv we had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age it 's harder to fill than the aviva and not as pretty but so what it works and the aviva does n't	14

1	this is the best ! ! ! drys you off fast and drys fast too so soft and comfy on my skin ! !	14
1	this is a great shaver if you are in the market for one considered the remington r 960 i am of afro american descent and was very skeptical about buying a rotary we shaver i had always gotten excellent results using remington shavers that were of the micro thin type to tackle the tough turf around my mug with its ergonomic design it was very easy to manipulate the shaver around in tough areas i had considered purchasing that of another brand until i discovered that remington makes one and now i'm loving it	14
1	this was a gift it came on time and was half the price of one we had looked at so we were happy	14
1	i bought this for my father in law who had a stroke this past summer at sixty eight years old my mother in law at sixty seven does n't have a lot of arm and shoulder strength and cannot wield a full size wheelchair around and constantly pull it in and out of the trunk of their toyota camry the light weight of this chair works great for short trips to appointments i would n't recommend it for a long day shopping at the mall however it 's not as easy to use as a full size standard wheelchair this is a great chair for shorter trips and appointments to make transferring easier to manage	14
0	it 's kind of bulky for a diaper bag which is why i got it the clippers are not good quality the thermometer is cheap it has a little f for fahrenheit that blinks until it is done reading the f is very little and hard to see when trying to hold a squirming 5 week old it also takes a while to read	14
0	this is the most innacurate thermometer i have ever come across each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more moreover the battery only lasts for 1 2 uses granted one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature but you would think the battery could last a few more times when you have a sick child accuracy and time are of the essence	14
0	this shaver holds a great charge and you can use it in the shower but that 's about it the shave is n't very close and it takes a long time to shave to do your underarms is somewhat painful with the pulling of the razor	14
1	i have used this supplement for more than five years at the suggestion of a herbalist i have never felt better not only does it seem to help keep those colds away it seems to keep me more health feeling and less tired	14
0	i had great results with this product with the first use however when i used it the second time the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface leaving me with a smooth useless triangle i replaced the triangle thinking i had a dud but had the same thing happen with the second pad the cream will work without the pad but not as effectively if the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface they will have a winner with this product on a positive note i love the facial product	14
1	i love this soap it 's a little big and hard to hold during shower but the smell totally makes up for it ! it has a very strong \( but good \) grapefruit smell it 's very fresh and rinses completely off	14
0	though the description of this product says it 's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat i used them once and then packed them away because i do not like the odor i wish the mitts had been unscented perhaps over time or by next winter the odor will be gone and i 'll get some use out of them	14
0	i just bought this small fountain for my office at work thinking that the soothing sound of water would be a nice addition however after setting it up i added the water and the waited and waited and waited to hear the cascading sound of water no cascading sound i added more water nothing i added less water absolutely nothing the design is built such that the water moves down without making any noise it is useless from that perspective plus you can tell it is made of plastic so it is n't really that nice to look at either i would definitely not buy this again and am contemplating getting rid of it after 1 week of use	14
0	the razor i bought came with packets of this gel as well as the lotion possibly due to the consistency the gel gets used up more quickly it is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is the key ingredient that makes the difference is menthol the gel has menthol so that 's why it can be irritating i read a review of shaving basics online and it says always avoid shaving with products containing menthol the lotion on the other hand always helps get a better shave and is quite soothing	14
0	i bought a pack of 3 and used twice daily in the shower to try and clear my oily skin problems this product left my skin dry and sometimes peeling did not work for me but it might work for you	14
0	of course it works great for as long as it works after some time my unit develped a leak unlike better showerheads the part connecting the head to the hose is assembled in two pieces that separate after time causing the seals to not set properly resulting in the kind of leak mine developed unless you want to replace your showerhead every couple of years i 'd stay away fom this model and good luck navigating watrepik 's website to get any help	14
0	i found this razor as the same as the other ones do n't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one the only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose et	14
1	loving this air purifier ! this was really the first one i have own so i ca n't compare it to any others it is very quite and takes alot of dust out of the air the first time i had to replace the filter i was shocked by how much dust i could of been breathing in worth picking up just wish it would of had an energy star label	14
0	it 's a gimmick looks good on tv does n't do what it says i'm embarassed to admit i even tried it	14
0	i bought these for my dad for christmas and they did not fit his head they did n't even fit mine and i have an average size head another thing they did not look cool at all they were ridiculous looking nothing like the photoshopped pictures	14
1	i'm sixty years old and i have been using this product for years when i had my yearly physical the doc ask me if i used anything because my skin looks so good roc delivers ! ! !	14
1	my husband and i love this thermometer for our own use let alone the grandkids ! it 's fast easy and reliable highly recommend it	14
0	i had this unit for about 6 months and it broke on me if it had n't broke i 'll give if 4 stars	14
1	this is the longest period of time that my husband has kept a pair of reading glasses the click readers loop around his neck and are always there when he needs them he gets lots of comments about how neat they are	14
1	i 've used the pigeon brand \( i believe it 's from japan \) milk storage bags those are the best quality bags i 've ever used unfortunately they 're also very difficult to find these lansinoh bags are a good substitute at 1 3 of pigeon 's price not bad at all ! my baby and i travel a lot so i bring along my stock of bmilk in these lansinoh bags no mishaps thus far highly recommended	14
1	i have owned and broken most grabbers on the market the fold up gopher is a joke another with a flimsy wire down the center breaks after too much use and the heavy duty unit from lowes is hard on the wrist this unit is the smart way to go ! it is strong and durable and makes the most sense in the way it utilizes the strength of the hand and fingers and relieves pressure from the wrist also it is exactly the correct length for a six foot man no bending at the lumbar required	14
0	i saw a review that made it seem like these were indistructable not so ! they tear easily better than just empty wal mart bags though but not by much	14
0	i purchased this lumbar support for a recent back problem big mistake ! it simply will not stay put no matter what chair i tried it with the arch that is supposed to help relieve back pain and give support is just too much it has you bending over backwards i believe it actually made my back ache more	14
1	my wife and i both love this in our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable head trip than the trippers one might find in the mall the vibrations make it better than the non vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations it 's a pretty simple device sold at a reasonable cost and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones	14
0	i bought this straightener because i wanted a skinny straightener to get closer to the scalp however while it is not a horrible product i have a 15 dollar vidal sassoon one that works much better i would suggest either buying the really expensive ones or just sticking with one bought at the store this is n't any better than those	14
1	i like this kit very much and my colleague are going to purchase it when they saw mine	14
1	recently got my sleepmate and it is very effective somehow it blocks out most sounds outside of my bedroom and i do n't have any trouble sleeping i use to wake up at least 2 3 times a night and have the hardest time getting back to sleep i hardly ever wake up at all now great product and i 'd definately recommend it to anyone in need of a good night 's sleep	14
0	when i bought this the other review was n't posted yet now please benefit from our two reviews this thing is a total joke useless too small \( i have larger hotel samples \) i too would like to return this but i just do n't have time before christmas amazon should not offer this item it is a complete let down over priced and just a joke no fooling	14
0	i bought one and it worked great at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot but once you get used to it it does a stellar job of straightening your hair around 6 months into using the straightner the machine slowly overheated and died thinking i had a faulty model i went out and bought a new one guess what \? a few months into that one it ended the same way so basically not worth it	14
0	had this for less than a month and it just stopped heating the only reason i gave it one star is because of the size and when it did heat it was nice but for the dozen times used it was not worth buying will be returning it	14
1	i 've used several types of cervical cold packs over the past few years both at home and also professional cold packs at chiropractic appointments to help decrease muscle inflammation and this is by far the best because of its super flexible fabric immediately from the freezer and its ability to stay cold for a longer time if needed	14
1	i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves it she is able to do her nail easily the nail attachments work really well and strong the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone compact size easy to store and quick charge time	14
1	this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure we 're yet to verify what the culprit is but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch i would highly recommend this guy if you 're looking for a wrist inflatable blood pressure monitor it 's been consistant reliable and informative for both myself and my doctor	14
0	i had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea it is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong it literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado i do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone	14
0	i went through 3 of these in less than 2 months after about 2 3 weeks of use the first two dryers would n't shut off when the switch was placed in the off position the dryers had to be unplugged to turn them off the 3rd dryer just stopped working completely after about 2 weeks i definitely do not recommend buying this product	14
0	it vibrates like a massage mode of sonic complete you 'll get less than what you pay you should brush hard even while it is vibrating	14
0	there is no way to keep this product in place in the mouth other than by keeping pressure on it with your teeth this defeats the purpose of a product that is supposed to help reduce the grinding and clenching of teeth very disappointing	14
0	two main problems with this cordless massager the first being that it does n't hold a charge for very long you may get an hour use on a full charge and that shows diminishing power as it goes add to that it 's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment if you 're looking for something to rumble a slight bit this is for you otherwise save your money	14
1	i have used the unit for about two weeks with nimh rechargable batteries installed and it performs as advertised there is in my opinion a design flaw the start stop button acts as the power on off function and is easily depressed at unwanted times e g putting into or removing from the case they could should have included an ac adapter	14
1	this is a great tool this help people to get back on track physically it is hard to find effective training tools this one is great for those who need back door training simple to use and rock hard ! up yours	14
0	i bought this with the notion that i would be receiving what was pictured the filters that have a built in replacement gauge oops ! what i ended up with was the cheaper replace every two month whether they need it or not filters oh well whats a little customer service when there 's a buck to be made not like it 's false advertising to send people a cheaper product then what they thought they were getting	14
0	i bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they do n't have automatic shutoff but now they do i guess this is considered an improvement but i bought them for an elderly cat and she ca n't reset the control every hour they are a good value if you do n't mind the auto shutoff	14
0	it made my skin very dry and break out because of it my floormate had the same reaction we were both very disappointed i recommend going for vitaclear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than proactiv although it is a little more expensive than this	14
0	this is easily the worst beard trimmer i 've used it slips and cuts hair much shorter than anticipated and the teeth on the guard are far too fine	14
0	razor works great but it 's easier to open it and run water over it to clean because the cradle does n't get all the hair out	14
1	this is the best dispenser we have used it attches to the wall easily is eay to fill and is constructed in such a way that it has multiple uses we purchased smaller ones to give as gifts knowing others would like it also	14
1	hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushhead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards i use the soft brushhead because i used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen but since using the hydrabrush and the 8 brushes \( 4 on each side \) i do n't have to worry about missing when i brush my teeth excellent product	14
1	if you are trying to learn relaxation through biofeedback this is the product to buy packaging support presentation and hardware software quality are the best that i have seen no down side it 's not a game in the usual sense more of a way to learn techniques in a quiet and amusing way there is room for a little mischief instead of allowing the balloons to flow smoothly i tried busting a few type a personality shows through occasionally i will be purchasing the next item in the series i am learning to relax at will which will be helpful in my high stress occupation good luck	14
1	i ordered this parfum because it is really cheap i received it 4 days after ordering delivered very fast the flavor is very nice make me feel comfortable	14
0	the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch however it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate the 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack i had intended to use it as a cold mask only	14
1	well the other reviews tell you that the shaver works great compared to other battery operated shavers i agree my point is that one can buy lithium batteries for about a dollar each google for led flashlight reviews and you will find highg quality cheap lithium batteries some of them were even tested and evaluated by the flashlight guys	14
1	that 's the only way i can rate this product if it taste great then it gets a high rating from me	14
1	the best price around for this type massager price was my main reason for the purchase mine does heat up but the massager does have to be running for a few minutes before you notice it the programmable feature is nice as well as the many variable speeds i would highly recommend it	14
0	this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington beforethis product gives me nothing but trouble	14
0	this is the classic original round stick old spice deodorant formula and now i realize that it is really dated the formula has n't changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms if you want the great smell of old spice then just use the after shave and cologne but stay away from the old stick deodorant i 'll continue to use the old spice high endurance deodorants which have improved modern formulas scents and work much much better	14
1	i 've used hot air brushes for a couple years this works better than my last the low setting and the larger brush works better for me the high setting blows the hair off the bristles it 's nice having the small brush option for different styles though i believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron	14
0	i got this as a gift for my husband he used it for about 3 weeks but still had red marks and had to follow up afterwards with a regular disposable razor the whole process of shaving took twice as long as disposable razors and was n't as good luckily braun had a 30 day money back guarantee so we were able to return it \( minus shipping x 2 \)	14
0	this item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs i am tall with a 37 inseam this item is not made for someone who has longer than average legs unless you 're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage	14
0	i'm a huge fan of the pria line but these are not like the others they are heavier and a little grainy i do n't hate them but will not buy them again the flavor is pretty good though just not what i was expecting i highly recommend the pria 110 calorie line the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind thank	14
0	this thing messed up my back it is extremely uncomfortable and i ca n't see anyone liking the feel of it furthuremore it smells terrible do not buy this product you will regret it \( shipping was n't bad	14
1	bought the massager overall ok but it is heavy to use with one hand after sometime it gets to you it has a good vibration capability better than the others i had could have a better handle and a longer cord how about making them 110 240v then i can travel with it	14
0	i'm sorry that i ordered these online i should have tried them first they do not fit round heads no matter how many times you adjust them they do not fit the bow needs to have an adjustment too the magnet is not that strong when put on a round head they just pop off would not buy another pair	14
1	smaller size did not fit me or my son it would be nice if you could use perhaps a hat size to determine right size standard size worked fine	14
0	this was a piece of junk neither my husband nor i could ever get it set correctly we wound up throwing it away going to target and buying one of their 10 000 steps pedometer that works great	14
0	i decided to try the caffeine free mega t because i quit caffeine a couple years ago and did n't want a diet supplement with caffeine i only needed to lose 10 pounds took as directed for 1 week also followed the diet and exercise program per the enclosed pamphlet after 1 week to my dismay i actually gained 3 pounds ! i contacted cca industries the company that makes mega t and they promptly informed me that they have a 30 day guarantee and to return them along with my receipt for a refund i shipped them back yesterday i gave a 2 star rating because of cca industries' customer service	14
1	i bought this item for my husband for christmas he has hip and knee problems so sleeping comfortably sometimes can be an issue for him we use these pillows everyday sitting up watching tv and he uses the head and knee wedges while he sleeps the only downfall now is that he sleeps so good he snores !	14
1	love this product have been using oil of olay before it was heard of by most this is more advanced and makes my skin look and feel more youthful	14
0	this product is great at exfoliating not so great at hair removal your skin will be silky smooth but still have hair the hair that is removed does n't stay gone long and it 's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body it will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product	14
0	does n't show you what station you are listening to it starts over at 88 9 every time you shut it off by the time you scan a few stations it stops getting a signal and you have to start off at 88 9 again	14
1	i was skeptical of this product especially at the price however i am so pleased with its effectiveness i rely on other reviewers remarks and so i am writing to tell you that it is definately worth the price i ca n't believe how quickly it clears up a pimple when i think of all the money i 've spent on products over the years and i'm in my 40s ! i was tired of buying products that overdried my skin but left me with a red angry looking spot this product is truly amazing and works as effectively on mild acne i only wish the zeno was around when i was a teenager	14
1	these are great for those days you just want to sit in the sun and read without sun glare great product	14
1	we love this new power toothbrush because it does a great job cleaning the teeth and it has so much more power than our old brush	14
1	i bought this for my father who only has one leg to use in his shower tub combo he loves it esp the height adjustment feature	14
1	the shampoo does n't lather but it has a nice subtle scent that lasts all day and it seems to be doing it 's job at fighting dandruff since my hair has been itch free since i started using it so i would recommend it	14
0	after reading several comments i tried to proof my scale is working properly however like someone else wrote the scale is not consistant i weight myself several times and noticed very considerable diferrences in readings like some one else i even tried placing an additional amount of weight in my hands the scale gave me several readings for the same amount of weight now ! a digital scale is supposed to be percise	14
0	we have only had this showerhead for one month already the nozzles are clogging the spray has become more like pins and needles than a gentle waterfall do not purchase this product if you have hard water	14
1	this is exactly what i wanted the last 1 i bought is over 10 yrs old and still going i was afraid each day it would go out and could not find a replacement anywhere you are a life i mean hair saver ! ! diane in texa	14
0	for the price you cant beat this product if the problem i'm experiencing can be solved i bought two of these brushes one for my home bathroom and one for my work out bag love the price and timer feature but it seems that once i 've used up the power in the brush it wont recharge properly i'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long i leave it in the charger if there is a simple fix for this then i 'd say 5 stars if not then 2 stars is well earned seeing as how i 've been on their support line waiting \( as i type this \) for over an hour	14
1	these are a great yuumy snack for someone who counts calories \( or points \) it 's nice to have an option that is relatively healthy and still tastes great ! i have never met a luna bar i did n't like though this is my favorite flavor	14
1	accurate scale records use of two different users plus guests \( or your chlidren ! \) remembers prior info body fat is a great and fairly accurate feature these combined features make it worth the cost plan on reading the manual to set up	14
1	these are marvelous ! ! i had gotten a different style last february for mothers these adventure towels are great for the dorm and college kids i love the snap strap and the pouch now all of my children want them too ! ! also love the up to date colors !	14
1	this toilet paper will never feel like the cozy stuff that blocks the toilet on a regular basis but it is a product that feels somewhat better than varieties you find in many public toilets i am willing to compromise a tiny bit of plush and save all the hours spent attached to toilet plungers i do concern myself with any chemicals that are placed into a product that makes it rapid dissolve and will in time try an environmentaly friendly brand a great option for family with kids who know no limits for toilet paper usage and ignore the presence of a plunger	14
1	i have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist it works for me but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing brushing and generally good tooth care	14
1	it 's small folds down and is great to pack for a trip instead of your big hair dryer i just wish you could set it on cool and blow as fast cuz it does get pretty hot very convenient item if you travel	14
0	i have not tried the product yet as it is a stocking stuffer for my four year old the ad displays four soaps when in fact you only receive one i would not have purchased one bar of soap had i have known	14
0	i got this curler set and i completely regret it ! i used it once and i wont touch it again ! it left my hair frizzy and there was a bump from where the clamps were it took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down i would n't even give it one star take my advice do not buy this !	14
1	compared to the energy bars on the market these days \( cliff powerbar etc \) that taste terrible hooah bars are awesome they really work too energy wise great for long bike rides triatholons etc or even something to eat before practice for athletes they are awesome i am a huge fan	14
0	every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight we returned it to amazon probably the first time we 've ever had to do that for the price it should at least work also in only the 4 days we had it a large chip came off the corner it earns two stars for looking great i would not recommend it	14
1	i have used olay regenerist perfecting cream for over a year now it leaves the skin feeling very soft without feeling greasy and seems to smooth out the skin nicely it does not have spf protection so for daytime i use a lighter moisturizer with spf over it before applying my foundation at night it 's all you need	14
1	like the product very much comfortable and convenient i would recommend then if you have a small hat size do n't mind carrying around an odd shaped soft carrying bag with the above i do n't have a problem the most distracting problem is your eyes sweat inside the foam enclosed goggle like eye pieces on warm days i 've thought about cutting vents in the foam around the eye but have not done this as of jan 2007 i like them very innovative	14
1	exactly what i wanted works perfectly the flosser at the bottom the head of the toothbrush is great at getting between the teeth charges quickly and is convien	14
0	this one 's going back to the store it has been turned on for almost half an hour and i barely feel the heat if you ask me my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat as for the massage it 's worthless to me but i am not one for vibrating massage anyway i prefer shiatsu i get cold feet when i am home and not moving around a lot so i think i will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet	14
1	after reading the review regarding palm kernel oil in all of the luna bar flavors i decided to read all the ingredients for each flavor myself i noticed that the luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is the only flavor that does not contain palm kernel oil if you are concerned about palm kernel oil you should purchase this flavor the toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is delicious does n't taste like a candy bar and has low total and saturated fat gram percentages luna bar toasted nuts 'n' cranberry flavor is one of the better nutrition bars available on the market	14
1	i am very satisfied with my purchase of the wooden foot roller massager it gives you a relaxed feeling for sore and tired feet i discoverd that if you turn it on the other side you can also use it on your arms and legs by holding it	14
0	the brush completely feel apart prior to using it i sent a review to the company with no response the wooden back fell off of the handle and then the loofah fell off of the backing if i would have had some response from the company offering some recourse i would not have been this dissatisfied	14
0	the scale is already broken it just reads lo when you step on it and i just got it a couple of weeks ago it worked for about a week and a half	14
1	i used to own a brush from another manufacturer it never brushed well the heads wore out waaaaaaaay too quickly i just never felt i was getting a good brush after using this brush for about a couple of months i went in for a regular checkup my dentist told me my teeth had never looked better that 's all the testimony i need	14
0	this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0 the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs give or take a few from clothes i was extremely shocked ! how could i weigh that much ! ! turns out the scale was off approx 20 pounds 20 pounds !	14
1	the roller balls are excellent ! the rolling action and three different speeds are excellent as well the only drawback is the mesh over the pillow it is abrasive to the skin i have had to put a thin pillow case on top of it and that solved the problem the only other problem is it has a hard area where your head lies so you must make sure you are situated properly other than that it is the best machine on the market i have found and i have tried many	14
1	at first i did n't quite get how great this shaving cream is because you have to work a little harder to get it to lather than the other shaving creams or gels i had been using but once it breaks into a lather it 's great plus it lasts at least 3 times longer than regular cans of shaving cream gel i'm buying this from now on	14
1	compared to the olive aloe bar this one seems to lather better	14
1	purchased as a christmas gift for a friend who uses this product he was excited to receive this i was excited that i was able to purchase it at a considerable savings over department store prices this same product in a smaller size retails for 45 55 locally and i was able to purchase him a larger bottle for less than 30 this particular item by davidoff is not always easy to find and i was glad to not only find it here but to find it at such a reasonable price	14
0	the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head \( but be careful of buns \) the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet	14
1	\( \) it takes some getting used to but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave i got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks but i think i was pressing too hard like i had to with my old razor just a light touch gives a close shave the attachable sideburn trimmer does n't do a very good job in my opinion but i kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose the gel packs go pretty quickly but maybe i'm using too much i'm still trying to get the hang of it it 's a different experience than your basic razor	14
0	i had the exact same experience as stan another reviewer i bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off i could not get it started again like stan i thought it was a fluke and bought another same problem two days after buying the pad i have looked in four stores in the seattle area and cannot find another brand of heating pad this one should not be on the market i am sending both pads back to the manufacturer	14
1	the only sunglass reading glasses i could find plus because they can hang around the neck i do n't forget where they are	14
0	i got this humidifer for my daughter 's bedroom she loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time then automatically shut off tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail i had to return it however i did buy the penguin shape for my 2nd daughter 's room and that one works great	14
0	my wife was very pleased with the vanity perfume tray with all of the snow we have had it arrived shortly after christmas but just in time to warm her heart for the new year	14
1	my youngest daughter has had mild to severe asthma for 32 years and has had to use an inhaler almost on a daily basis i bought her this product to use in her new house as she was having severe asthma attacks from dust mold pollen ect she has been using this product for three \( 3 \) months now and she has not had to use her inhaler a single time we have used several other brands and types of air cleaners in the past twenty years but none have proven as effective as this product highly recommeded	14
1	the product does what it says it cuts your hair and contains it all in a vacuum container	14
1	nizoral anti dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product i noticed a difference the first time i used it there was no residue on my scalp and my flakiness was greatly reduced it produced a very rich lather also the only thing i did n't like about it was the possibility that i 'd have an allergic reaction to the ingredients but the instructions did n't tell which ingredients might make this happen i myself am sensitive to many products and did n't have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo i would recommend this product to others	14
1	i purchased the sound therapy radio to take on a trip my roommate is a snorer and i figured i needed the sound i tried it out at home and liked it it has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use the alarm and clock are added goodies for me as i was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel it was a good buy for my purposes	14
0	perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality my experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all i threw the item in the trash and bought a conair at kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better my recommendation is do not buy	14
0	i received this tweezer for christmas so i'm glad i did n't spend anything for it because it 's not even worth 50 cents the tweezer portion does not grip on to any hairs it 's a piece of crap as far as i'm concerned do not bother purchasing this product if you do you 'll regret it	14
0	i bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as i would like ! it is so hard to find a good heating pad now but i would not reccomend this one	14
0	i 've only used the unit 3 times and the flip over trimmer broke when i flipped it over to attach to the main clipper head the plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head that cracked in two and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor it 's very disappointing i'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer i ca n't seem to find the receipt	14
0	i'm very sorry but the universal remote control was not what i expected like when i want to turn on my tv the vcr came on and visa versa but the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money very pleased about the service thanks regards yoka van dijk	14
0	this heating pad was received as a gift to replace the sunbeam heating pad i had used for 35 years and had finally worn out i was delighted with the larger size but the new pad did not heat at all i returned it to homedics \( along with the 5 handling charge \) and two months later they sent a replacement the replacement heats up but after one use the pad was hopelessly twisted it almost looks like it has melted to itself and it ca n't be flattened out i wo n't be sending this one back with another 5 handling charge it is n't worth it this one goes out with the trash and i go back to sunbeam	14
1	my hair gets weighed down very easily by finishing smoothing products they will leave my hair looking flat and greasy instead of smooth my hair is very fine but also thick \( which is very annoying \) this finishing solution leaves my hair very smooth without weighing it down it seems very expensive for such a small bottle but a little goes a long way \( i 've had the same bottle for nearly a year and it 's still not finished \) definitely spritz it into your hands and not directly into your hair because it does not disperse at all the scent is very light and refreshing and not at all overwhelming	14
0	so yeah it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups and once it 's mounted it stays put pretty well unfortunately it has so far never actually been fogless get a good shower going and the mirror fogs up in record time splash some water on it and you can see yourself for half a minute but overall this is a disappointment	14
1	this is a great heating pad if you like heat it ranges from low to hi with 4 settings in between \( that is 6 settings \) especially nice is the loooooong cord my old heating pad has like a 6 ft cord and i always needed an extension cord for it good purchase !	14
1	this shaver is the best shaver i have ever used it gives me the closest shave it is very comfortable to hold it is great my brother in law liked it so much he bought one	14
0	i did not like this thing at all it took too long to shave my legs it did n't even remove all of the hair it irritated my skin as well	14
0	i bought this scale as an upgrade from a wal mart cheapo scale hated it ! ! i should have read the dimensions more carefully but it was so large that it became the focal point of our bathroom worse still it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again returned the item but ate the 11 return ship fee it 's huge and heavy	14
0	out of the box did n't work would not have givin it a 1 star review if there was a zero now its time to play the refund game	14
1	i get compliments all the time on this scent it is one of my favorites it smells exactly like cotton candy its fun flirty and nostalgic of childhood romps at the fair ! if you like sweet edible scents then this one is for you	14
0	do not buy this iron it 's fabulous while it works for which it does merit the one star but it broke in less than a week it overheated or something and then would n't turn on again but here 's the kicker if you buy it from amazon the company wo n't honor the warranty i do n't have particularly heavy duty hair this is just totally unacceptable	14
1	this is a great sized foot bath i pour hot water in it sit back and relax it does n't keep the water warm but if i start off with really hot water it stays warm until i'm ready to get out using the pedicure attachements is hard work though i just assume use a hand held brush the bubble feature is too loud to use while watching tv still for the price i like this foot bath i 've even given it as a gift	14
0	i had to return my recent purchase due to a defect i have used waterpik dental water jets for many many years and typically have to replace every two or three years i was disappointed to receive a defective product but began shopping locally for another dental water jet i purchased the waterpik ultra and i am pleased with the design size and operation thus far i just hope waterpik can maintain quality of their products and that my current purchase will provide another two to three years of service	14
1	i like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model the kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth it 's a bit louder than the older model probably because it 's got an additional motion and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light overall just what we wanted	14
1	i got what i expected it 's functional and not too poorly made the only problem i had was that the scratcher part was a little too sharp i filed the sharp edges off and now it 's great the rolling wheels still have no function for me but they do n't get in the way	14
0	do not buy this ! ! ! it does not work as seen on t v we were able to get it to cut a cucumber and that was it would not cut a tomato onion carrot apple only a cucumber complete waste of money	14
1	i use this product all the time it was becoming hard to find in department stores but i found it available and cheaper online i'm very happy	14
0	i have always thought that a man 's shaver would work on woman 's beard this one does not	14
1	this is a truly amazing deal from amazon where i also received free priority mail shipping the photo does not display all that you will get you will receive 6 boxes of q tips cotton swabs totaling an ammazing 3 500 q tips in all i will never ever have to purchase another q tip as long as i live ! ! ! ! ! what a fantastic deal from amazon !	14
1	this shaver has met all my expectations it cleans and recharges itself automatically the shave is close and nick free the only slight negative is the cleaning time per shave could run to 20 minutes	14
0	i got the machine for my fat muscle and water analysis as well as my weight after 1 month of use it only shows the weight the scale no longer works properly it no longer shows anything else but the weight it was a waste of money	14
1	i 've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best strong motor easy adjust strong vacuum other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me one would n't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard the idea is to glide the unit over your beard you 're not raking you 're trimming ! also the unit is easy to clean out after use the waste receptacle snaps out easily as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris	14
1	my husband was totally delighted with the rollator walker it is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone would n't want this new much more attractive kind it folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things when folded up it fits in the back seat of our car and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large we put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great what more can you ask	14
1	received this watch in timely manner very pleasantlysurprised at feeling of weight solid constructionand ruggedness had about given up at getting a watchwith digital dial that was not a casio plastic watch have recently bought the soloman stainless version anda gold vestal model will let my relatives choose whichwatch suits them as a gift gene setchell	17
1	works great fits well and has a nice design definitely recommend i	17
1	este es un lindo producto hermoso y elegante pero se raya muy facil igual me gusta y lo uso todos los dias pero no creo que sea algo de muy larga duracion	17
1	this heart box is great for your skagen or other brand watches or you can use it as a jewlery box for your bracelets the box makes a v day or anniversary gift even more special your loved ones will appreciate the box as a sentimental reminder of the special gift the watch pillow is plush padded box top and outside inside box is lined with velvet	17
1	i have three holes in each ear and i really needed some tiny diamond earrings for the top holes these are wonderful ! they are small but exactly what i wanted such a great buy for this price	17
0	got the watch friday in the mail it looks cool and nice and teh band is shiny the number lines glow nicely in the dark i willoberserve the watch and come back in a month to say my opinions	17
1	great features on this watch i especially like the linked timers and the three alarms my wrist is tiny and the selection of holes is great \( i use the tightest \) this does leave a gap because the band is still bigger than my wrist and the extra band wraps all the way around but it does n't slip and it feels very comfortable the alarm sound is pleasant the color is great too	17
1	i purchased one of the casio men 's atomic waveceptor yellow dial watch vq200hda 9bvcf from amazon this watch is great it updates the time automatically \( just switched to daylight savings and i did n't have to touch a thing \) instructions say to position watch in a window or where it has view to the sky for updates my watch was in a drawer under a marble top and it updated just fine i saw in other reviews complaints about the plastic back this is a must to allow the auto updates again cool looking great watch ! ! ! !	17
1	lovely little apple charm just what i wanted picture a little deceptive though i thought the charm would be larger than it actually was otherwise great item i'm happy	17
1	this watch looks classy wears comfortably and is very light my only complaint so far is that it seems to scratch rather easily	17
0	i was very disappointed in this purchase and eventually ended up returning it the actual product did not live up to my expectation while the cross was of average quality \( not great but ok \) the chain was very cheaply made it did not even have a clasp on it you had to pull it over your head to get it on the price of this item did not match the quality of the product by any means even though i was disappointed with the item i have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back no questions asked	17
1	equal to my swiss watches fit and finish is very nice only two seconds off per day the luminessence is incredable reason not giving five starsbecause of not having saphire crystal	17
1	i gave this necklace to my daughter who was becoming a new big sister and she just loved it the necklace was very symbolic because the big heart represented big sister and the little heart represented little sister holding on i just loved it	17
0	i do n't know who 's running the show at amazon but thier packing is atrocious they packed this watch with only a single air bubble of course when i received it it fell out of its tin and was scratched be wary of buying anything from amazon in regards to precious jewelry watch was fine though so if you really want this item purchase it somewhere else	17
1	i bought this necklace after reading reviews about different types breaking easily this one is very good so far and my wife loves it for the price i paid it is a great product	17
0	bought this for our 20 year old son for x mas i was very disappointed with the quality of this 85 pendant and returned it the very next day the chain looked and felt like plastic my initial reaction when i took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine went to a christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for 28 that was 1 000 times better than this 85 one	17
1	i purchased these watches for my daughters birthday party and they were a big hit all the kids just loved them ! !	17
0	the locket on this cable chain is so tiny you will not be able to put a picture in it after opening the box and being completely disappointed i opened the locket to see how it worked it would not close properly after opening the quality of this necklace is not good do not waste your money	17
1	simple and elegant earrings my wife loves them however the backs are a trifle small to work with ba	17
0	this was a present to myself for my birthday i thought i was purchasing a quality product two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working i took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again i sent it back for a refund and not very happy i have to pay a restock fee for a defective item i will be rethinking future purchases	17
0	i bought this ring for my fiance since i have one and it 's a terrible ring we got it apart and then have not been able to get it back together it 's been over a month now we went online to get the directions that did n't help either plus the ring is so cheap it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape it is cheap and completely useless	17
1	i had been looking at the skagen watches for six months and could not find any sales they are priced around 110 when i saw this particular model for 69 i was excited i read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions this watch arrived three days after i ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like i had bought at the store it was brand new and i love it i especially love it when i get something new on sale and a great deal amazon is a great place to order i get merchandise very quickly and at a great price	17
0	the packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale nice black leather case much nicer than the bracelet deserved however the bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap it is not rounded as pictured but flat like a dog tag \( only much smaller \) i'm using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but i would never wear it by itself i understand though that it is not an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for 925 silver at that price	17
1	i like this watch it 's good price and also cool look \) hey guys you will not lose anythings if you have one like it	17
1	i am really happy with this purchase ! the earrings came together in an attractive box \( perfect as a gift but i do n't want to give them away \) they are nice and large on my earlobe and look great they are really soft to the touch and i like the colors too	17
1	these earrings are so cute ! they are a great size for a toddler but probably a little large for a small infant it is so hard to find safety back earrings that are cute these are a beautiful rose pink color very sweet	17
1	these earrings are very pretty not too big not too small just right for the price you ca n't go wrong the gift box they arrived in was sort of cheesy but they were for me so i did n't mind if i were giving them as a gift i 'd put them in a prettier box before giving them to the recipient overall very pretty earrings good value no complaints	17
1	got several silver peices but this is the one she loves ! th	17
0	the first watch i received did not work at all the second watch runs fast i really thought seiko made a better product maybe it really is n't a seiko	17
1	the quality of this piece is really surprising ! i purchased this as a gift for a 16 year old when i received it i immediately loved the styling and the chain i was very pleased to have found such an appropriate lovely gift at such a great price	17
1	i m very happy to buy in amazon shipping was perfect and on time	17
0	the topaz earring is nice enough and probably worth 45 but be aware that it is smaller than it looks on the web page the shaft that hangs between the two stones is about 5 16 long the larger stone is about 3 16 wide and 1 4 high the small stone is about 3 32 wide essentially you get what you pay for	17
1	this necklace is well made very lovely i am very pleased with the quality	17
1	my husband just loves this watch and ca n't get over the great quality for the price	17
1	made a little girl very happy order processed shipped and delivered in a timely manner just as expected	17
0	wife liked them so much she asked me to buy her a set of black ones she was also happy that they had 14k gold posts she loved the quality	17
1	extremely reliable easy to read looks like the rolex style only it is very lightweight good for everyday use because you can wear either gold or silver jewelry with this watch i would have given it 5 stars if it were one of those models which does not need a battery	17
0	it was larger than i expected from the images thicker too in my opinion it did n't look as classy as the picture made me believe i was very disappointed that the regular second hand was not in fact the large sweeping thin hand that 's actually only for the stop watch the regular second hand is one of the gimmicky minature dials in the middle really with the extra bulk and my dislike of which hands were which and the cheaper look of the watch in person i never actually put it on before sending it back	17
1	i 've purchased this watch from mid watch company as you can see it 's a fab casual watch and is worth the price the service was great and on time and i am very pleased with this purchase thank you	17
1	this pendant is much prettier in person it 's got a nice polished finish not satin matte like in the image it hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain i 've already received several compliments on it	17
1	i recently received the item and i love it it is whisper quiet works in both directions and is automatic i have seen other winders at 5x this price that do n't do the same any of the winder would be a waste of money unless they sell a single winde	17
1	this necklace turned out to be a fantastic gift she wears it everyday with every outfit it looks great with jeans and a t shirt and with an extravagent dress	17
0	i bought this watch for my husband but did n't take the time to read the description carefully so it 's my fault i had to send it back he is in the army and leaving soon for iraq i thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift unfortunately it does not work if you 're more than 2 000 miles from colorado if you are not going to leave the continental united states i suppose it would be a good watch	17
1	jewelry watcheslive well you 'll be always in a high spirit if you purchase this bracelet it 's a really good gift for your friends	17
1	i first came across the silver insanity line of celtic jewelry last year when i was looking for christmas presents jackpot ! i confess i spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items both on amazon and on the silver insanity website the teardrop earrings i picked out were quite a success so much so that i recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver celtic knot earrings for myself i 've been very happy with my selection and i just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend i highly recommend the items from silver insanity and plan to order from them again	17
1	my husband bought this for the 2nd time after losing the first it is nice for dressy or casual highly recommended	17
1	my husband had seen this watch advertised in a magazine and fell in love with it and had to have it i searched at tommy stores large department stores and was not able to find it anywhere except amazon com the watch arrived as promised and my husband loves the watch	17
1	i ordered it and it came very quickly \( earlier than expected \) i love this pearl necklace	17
0	this ring had such great ratings after visiting it often i finally bought it as a gift when i saw it in person i was not impressed it does look like the picture but it also looks cheap i do realize it costs cheap i just was n't impressed it did arrive very quickly though	17
1	it exceeded my expectation it looks great and seems quite sturdy i bought for casual days when i am either skiing or just hanging out on a weekend i like it	17
1	i bought this as a present for my daughter i was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring \( if anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together check wikipedia i believe there is even a video \) i highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver symbolism and something just a little bit different	17
0	this product is not worth the price by itself it 's fair at buy 1 get 4 free the time function works fine the compass on the other hand is virtually useless having gotten 5 watches all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions	17
1	i bought these for my wife and she liked them very much 7mm is not as small as you may think i certainly would n't buy anything larger in this style i got them on sale for 15 00 ca n't go wrong with that price for 14k gold	17
1	the wife has a hard time with watches and this one has made her very happy	17
0	this ring does not look as pictured it arrived today \( almost 3 weeks after i ordered it \) and is extremely thin has tarnish marks and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places it looks like it came out of a vending machine and i'm obviously pretty disappointed i wo n't be buying anything from this vendor again	17
1	these are very well crafted little earrings i love how they look and the price just ca n't be beat ! these have made me want to buy many more things from silver insanity ! the only problem i did experience with these earrings is that the post is rather long and it pokes the side of my head when i sleep otherwise i could n't love them more !	17
1	this is my second skagen watch my first one which was almost identical to my new one lasted ten years of daily use i love the two tone combination of gold and stainless steel my only disappointment is that at a glance it is difficult to tell the minute hand from the second hand i think the hour and minute hands should be slightly more heavier than the second hand otherwise i love the profile design of this watch including where the comfortable mesh band meets the watch face	17
0	this watch stinks crappy manual the band is so big it could fit around my leg and when i received it it didn't work now i have to pay extra to fix the band and to get it working so much for what i thought was a nice looking inexpensive watch i would 've given it no stars if i could don't make the same mistake i did avoid this watch	17
1	as a field engineer i have to work with tools inside machinery more often than not i keep my watch and i have had several scratched watches in the past so i was somewhat skeptical to wear a nice watch like this but the price seemed right to give it a try after 9 months of using it daily this watch has still not a single scratch the quality is very good and it really looks better than on the picture	17
1	the 18 description is for the necklace on it 's longest extended setting without using the extended part of the chain it is really closer to being child sized it is pretty and will end up being a gift for my daughter rather than the friend i had intended to give it to	17
1	i did n't expect the earrings to be so beautiful and they 're really easy to wea	17
1	this watch does a lot in a large light case i was impressed when it set itself during the recent time change very nice	17
1	my sister loved her necklace she was very pleased with it and so am i	17
1	another nice inexpensive tool that makes tedious work go much faster and easier	17
1	i have longed for gold hoop earrings for years these seemed liked they were the ones ! but i waited a while still debating finally 'went for it' and got a pair i have n't regretted it at all i find these earrings comfortable and i like the way they look on me i am very happy with these and recommend these beauties ! now if they would make them in white gold	17
1	when i received this item i could not believe how beautiful it was the price was insane for the quality and workmanship i will order more for my sisters	17
1	the watch arrived in timely fashion and was already set up this watch is super however it lacks a timer i left the timex ironman for this watch timex 's quality is horrid \( a watch per year \) and i changed to the casion g shock based on a recommendation of a friend i am glad i did if they ever get a timer in this watch i 'd buy another	17
0	not what i expected the box was handmade the instructions were some other tool i have contacted seller and was not satisfied with response	17
1	i have several fossil watches and every time i needed to adjust the band it cost me around 10 15 i found this tool and figured it was worth a try i was able to remove links from 2 of my fossil watches though my newest fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool i even used it to adjust watches for 2 of my friends it worked well made the adjustments and they were very happy with it ! they plan to buy it for themselves ! you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin but beyond that it works like a dream	17
0	i liked these earrings when i got them they were smaller than i hoped but would wear them anyway i lost one earring the first time i wore it ! ! ! ! ! i am so bummed ! so if you get them put a back on the wire part of the earring	17
1	i received these earrings as a gift and i do n't know what they are made of but i get an awful lot of compliments on them they seem to change color in response to what i am wearing i would definitely order other silver insanity items	17
1	i am very small featured and these are the perfect size light weight and very well made	17
1	i like it beacuse you can hang almost anything from it and it looks good the only downside is that the clasp is too big to get more delicate items on to it	17
0	these were the worst pair of earings i have ever seen they were yellow from a mile away amazon was very accomodating when i returned them but save yourself the hassle the price is too good to be true with these earings	17
0	these were on my mom 's wishlist so i bought them they just arrived and i'm totally disappointed i 'd return them if it would n't cost me and i was n't so lazy they look pretty darn cheap for starters also they came in a little plastic zipper bag inside of a little pseudo velour bag with a price tag for 3 30 on it save your money it 's best not to buy jewlery sight unseen	17
1	i love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective i contacted sabrina and they were great about sending me a new one asap with a label for returning the other one that was impressive and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued still the clasp is a product defect and i'm sure one of these days i will probably loose the bracelet b c it comes undone unknowingly	17
1	everyone loves this watch i wear it for work and it 's sleek enough to look sharp women constantly compliment me on how it looks	17
1	i was getting worried if it would arrive before my girlfriend went home for the holidays then as promised it arrived today last day in the estimated delivery window hey its christmas i understand shipping sucks this time of year but i still would have been angry if it was late ok item itself looks great i love the chain that came with it the box looks a little to cheesy on the outside to be romantic but the wrapping was high class enough to make up for the box im sure my girlfriend will love this it will go great with her tattoo	17
1	this watch changes the background color from red to black is great and the leather belt is soft but resisitance	17
1	although i 've only had it a few weeks i have had many compliments and questions on where i got it it is detailed and solid with a great message would recommend it	17
1	it 's got an alarm stop watch timer lap timer 5 alarms actually a water break alarm water resistant although do n't go aggressive swimming with it because water leaked inside mine and when it gets hot outside water vapor rises to the glass dial and it blurs out the time but other than that it 's a great watch finest i 've owned in terms of digital watch i highly recommend it	17
1	price point was excellent product quality is really good shipped on time was priced 50 compared to dillard 's locally and no taxes no shipping fees	17
1	the earrings were very cute and the screw backs were definitely a good find my daughter loved them so much she actually had them almost a whole month before she lost one but that is no bash on the earrings the fact that she did not lose them the first week is a major accomplishment i would definitely buy them again	17
1	this was a gift for my brother and he really enjoyed it it was shipped quickly which is always a plus	17
1	i'm very pleased with these earrings they are a good weight they are n't so heavy that they drag at the ear but they are substantial and a perfect size i 'd recommend these to earring lovers	17
1	this is a great choice for a business casual style watch with it 's crystal clear face and smooth shape it complements most business attire nicely the adjustment button does n't get pulled easily so there is less chance of accidental time loss after several weeks of wear still no scratches on the watchface and the metal remains untarnished i still get questions about it definitely an eye catcher	17
1	i bought one for my girl friend and she is very satisfied with it it is really beautiful	17
1	great watch bigger numbers and easier to see has all the features	17
0	the watch came in a great looking case the face of the watch was attractive then oops could n't fasten it because there was no fastener it came with a return address slip for sending it back which is nice but i 'd rather get what i thought i ordered	17
1	i love this ring ! nice and simple goes with my skin tone great i use my hands a lot at work and this thing has n't scuffed yet ! great buy great price will definitly buy from them again !	17
1	i bought this for my boyfriend as his valentine 's day gift he loved it ! it 's a great price for this watch as well	17
1	this watch just absolutely filled the wish for my 4 year old grandchild ! she is unable to tell time yet but she wanted a princess watch to help her learn and she was thrilled when she received it my daughter told me it was pretty and soft looking i insisted that the watch be one with hands not digital so we all were happy and satisfied ! ina lan	17
1	the box is soft and very durable but it is a bit big	17
0	i got this as well under the assumption that it wasnt a high end watch after wearing invicta 's for a while this feels like a gum wrapper on my wrist when i received it i noticed the small scratches all over the crystal nothing deep but they really pick up the glare atomic signal i am unable to get it to pick up one in memphis tn i think i should be in range and all my atomic clocks sync up fine i have tried it facing 4 different directions and also tried it outside to eliminate any interference from the house still no good basically i spent 30 dollars for a cheap watch that doesnt even have a backlight lesson learned	17
0	though the design is cool the quality of this earrings set is poor they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper i also bought the pendant with the same design and i'm so disappointed with both \( i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design	17
1	this is a very nice watch the pink mother of pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft the date is a little small but the watch is so nice that i did n't even care the only complaint i have is that amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside i had to get a new battery on my own but as soon as i told amazon they credited me the 10 that was great but they should have sent me a watch in working condition otherwise the watch is highly recommended even nicer than in the photo	17
1	i came in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected the person that received it loved it	17
1	i have owned both the black monster with bracelet \( my daily work watch \) and the orange with the rubber strap \( which i sold to an envious friend \) besides all of the compliments that i have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job i have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that i would be most confident to wear at depth as usual seiko does not disappoint	17
1	i just got this watch as a christmas present it is gorgeous the only thing is it 's a little bigger than i would like it to be the face is so femanine but the size makes it a little masculine the face is about an inch and a half in diameter and the band is a little over a half inch wide because it is so pretty i am keeping it however if you prefer a small dainty watch maybe this one is n't for you my friends are telling me bigger watches are in now so maybe they 're right \? \?	17
1	purchased this for my niece and she loved it it 's a great price and bright and colorful	17
1	this is a gorgeous and delicate looking watch i can read it without my glasses and so far it works i 've had trouble with timex in the past so i hope this holds up well it is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening	17
1	this is a nice looking watch overall if you like this style in black look for the t233xltmn it is a very very nice watch and popular in europe	17
1	i bought this as a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter michelle she absolutely adored it she told me she only wears it to church and special occasions i loved the price	17
0	big plus was the large digits on display i'm short sighted and run without my specs so i needed that the feel of the watch is nice however one big problem with it was that moving my wrist around kept poking the buttons and changing the display without warning \( maybe because i have big wrists \) bigger problem yet it took all of about 4 months for the plastic strap to break	17
1	this is an excelllent watch and it does what it promises to be	17
1	i really like this watch looks nice and has all the features i wanted	17
1	i got these for 9 on the friday sale they are well made and the perfect size you absolutely will not find a better pair for the price wait for the friday sale if you can	17
1	i really like my earrings that i bought and they came in time	17
0	poor quality one of the screw driver is already broken by using 2 times	17
1	great color and very well made while small for a primary pierce in the lobe they are the perfect size for my second pierce this company also makes beautiful 1 2 hoop earrings set with amethyst that i'm very happy with	17
1	i got these earrings for my wedding in june they are beautiful and look better than pictured they arrived well ahead of the scheduled ship date and i am very happy with them	17
1	this is probably one of casio 's least expensive wave ceptors it synchs every day indoors in a watch case that 's not by a window the digital display shows the day date and other info such as which time zone what time it synched i'm just concerned that the analog digital display and receiving every day will make it a battery eater it 's available in different dials but the blue seems to be the most common i give it 4 stars because the luminous paint is not very bright and the crystal is acrylic scratches easily but that 's not really an issue because i have about 15 watches and this one gets very little wrist time	17
1	paid 45 for these and worth every penny they are delicate the color is brilliant the stones are very clear i wore them to work as soon as i got them and received more than a few compliments on them they would make a wonderful gift for someone and even better for yourself	17
1	i am very pleased with this product and have had numerous positive comments about how sharp the timepiece looks the dial is much larger than most watches but i have big wrists so it was perfect the size also gives an updated look the only negative comment i have is that the watch is pretty thick and binds on shirt cuffs but that is a minimal problem great reproduction watch	17
1	it was just what i wanted i wear this ring on my pinky finger and it looks perfect color clarity and triquetra pattern are striking	17
1	an excellent watch stylish accurate and takes a beating ! seiko has always had a success with this one and at 150 i paid half the retail price	17
1	this is such a gorgeous bracelet ! i'm glad i ordered it for myself	17
1	everything was ok i actually recommend	17
1	i received this pair of hoop earrings as a christmas gift from my boyfriend when i first open the box i thought they were earrings for an infant the earrings are very very small however they are cute as i started wearing the earrings i began to really like them they are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession if you really like dainty jewelry i highly recommend this item	17
1	i 've had two skagen watches and have to say they are my favorite i love the large face and the titanium bracelet \( you do n't have to remove the watch in order to shower ! \) a lot of people have complimented me on the watch too given the price and quality you ca n't go wrong if you ever need a part replaced you just send it to skagen the work is completed in a couple of weeks ! in summary an elegant watch at a reasonable price	17
1	these earrings are very pretty i'm very pleased ! nice faceting and sparkle the stones are a medium bright green with a little yellow and brown mixed in which only seem to make the stones more intriguing and beautiful the peridot stones in these earrings are the prettiest i 've owned so far highly recommend	17
0	the stones in the earrings were not at all like pictured they look very chea	17
1	very pleased with this bracelet the crystals are gorgeous it is a wow bracelet	17
1	these are so danty and comfortable to wear was an excellent price as well thanks for the offer	17
1	this watch is a great looking watch and the indigo light gives it all it needs to meet your everyday use because of its gold tone and silver tone band you do n't have to worry about what color jewelry you wear with it because it matches it all well worth the price	17
1	i really like them they look elegent on me one of the most favorite parts besides the looks that i especially like is that they are the french loop kind that are easy and fast to put on and that they are heavy enough that they stay in place this reduces the risk of losing them but they are also light enough that i don t feel bogged down with them on my ears	17
1	needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything including great taste she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it it arrived promptly in time for christmas and it is very stunning not gaudy at all just classic style beauty could probably be worn to her office each day \( upscale casual \) or if she is dressed up the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself and i am not a huge jewelry fan	17
1	love the earrings i have small earlobes and use these earrings in my second holes they are just perfect	17
1	i love this watch i thought by looking at the pictures and reading other comments that it was going to be big and bulky i was immediately surprised at how light it was it is easy to read and keeps good time it is also a very handsome watch the rotating bezel is a quick and easy way to time anything \( lasting less than a hour \) highly recommended !	17
0	the diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits as a result the diamonds are dark in color and do n't sparkle like one would expect for the money paid i'm still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost 3 weeks ago i do not recommend purchasing from this company if you 're looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye	17
1	i purchased this watch expecting an inexpesive one which i got but i recieved more than that it was cheap in price but definately not cheap in quality my watch has held up to drenching rains and with stood the water resistant up to 50 00 meters label with ease very comfortable easy to reset and has all the bells and whistles i love it ! !	17
1	the bracelet is a very bright and shiny quite nice it 's alot lighter than i was expecting i almost mistook it for plastic at first it would make a nice gift for a young teen girl	17
1	this pendant makes for a really nice accessory it does n't however come with a chain so plan on buying one or using an old one	17
0	i had loved it at first but i am one to leave a necklace on forever it started to get all kinked up and i could n't figure out how to straighten it out but the company did offer me a discount on a different chain even though it was past their 30 day policy nice for once in a while wearing and be careful when handling it	17
1	i gave this watch to my fiance as a gift and she loved it ca n't lose with this one	17
1	the facets make the chain quite sparkly i found it perfect for all my pendants not flimsy but not too heavy and not twisty like some other type chains	17
1	this watch looks like business the movement is what i really like you get about 5 ticks per second instead of 1 so it looks more sweeping \( though i would n't call it sweeping \) i give it a 5 based on looks and cost i have n't had it long and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly \( it was losing a few hours at night \) i guess it just needed to get charged up it 's no rolex but it 's no casio either	17
1	happy with the purchase the watch was what i expected casual enough to wear to work or for a night ou on the town	17
0	someone please help me ! ! i have tried all the online help videos and guides and such and i still cannot figure out how to put this blasted ring together again ! please help	17
0	actually i only wore it 2 days to work i took it off at night and put it on in the mornings on the 3rd day i noticed the silver peeling off i tossed it i know it was inexpensive but that was down right cheap never again ! ! ! !	17
0	i received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch unfortunately the crown would n't pull out \( to set the date time \) so i returned it immediately fortunately amazon 's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping \( either way \) for broken items i 'll probably try again with another invicta from amazon	17
1	i bought two of these \( one for each daughter 3 6 \) it is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children thank you	17
1	i'm logged in on my wife 's accont i never had problems with the band i liked the first one so much that after i ran over it with my car i ordered another if you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years you 'll love it it has a very intuitive design is lightweight and just works	17
1	i chose this watch because of the stunning and currently very fashionable 'rolex green' colour and because the price was right so how does it stack up \? nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces the quality and finish are excellent and the watch is easy to set for day and date it has a clear back so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work pretty cool clasp and strap are well finished and work well rotating bezel lines up perfectly at 12 o'clock nice sweeping hand movement great look and great value	17
1	i have skin allergies and was not able to find a watch that i could have on my skin until i found this watch the price of the watch could not be beat for the chance that i could not have it on thank you for suppling a great watch	17
1	this is the second item i have ordered from this company and i am extremely pleased with the quality and value for my money i would recommend them to anyone	17
1	this watch arrived very quickly and it is a very fine watch i had an earlier casio ceptor watch and the battery died i could n't find anyone to replace it so i needed a new watch by the time i had ordered this watch i actually replaced the battery myself in the old one so now i have two atomic watches but the g shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge a great deal	17
1	i received this watch from santa and boy did he do a good job i love it ! it is a very nice watch and it has handle the russle and tussle of a single mom 's life without much marks ca n't beat the price	17
0	this item cost alot of money but is a piece of crap do n't expect to put alot of money in this because it wo n't hold it my clip broke after a week do n't buy this item you can find better ones for a lot less money	17
0	i ordered this necklace thinking that it would be small and dainty it is actually quite large and cheap looking i was really disappointe	17
1	very high quality watch i recommend these to all luxury fans works without any problems my old citizen chronograph are working for over than 12 years by now daily used	17
0	i bought this for my daughter the display was dead when it arrived i took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery and the live battery let some display show but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used my daughter found a much cheaper watch at target with more features \( a stopwatch ! \) this one was n't even worth sending back	17
1	i love this watch it was my christmas present to myself the ribbons are easy to interchange and i wear them with the silver bracelet as well it comes in a cute and durable box that i now use to store all of my watches a perfect gift and good quality i especially like the little heart on the minute sweep	17
1	these have quickly become my favorite pair of earrings they look substantial when worn but they are lightweight and comfortable they go well with either silver or white gold necklaces they are shiny and have a classic appearance plus the snap bar locks them securely in place buy them and you wo n't be sorry ! they also make a great gift item	17
1	i bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace i had seen at the smithsonian institute i love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi strands of this design this combination truly illuminates my evening wear by far the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court with so much class it is still affordable this necklace is an exceptional gem	17
1	my girls love them the face of the watch is clear and easy to see they also like that it lights up	17
0	this watch was of such poor quality that the second hand fell off by the third day of use the cost of shipping to claim a defect under warranty was more than the initial cost of the watch a total disappointment and waste of time and money do n't buy this watch	17
1	had these on my wish list and received them as a gift they are even more lovely in person they are one of my favorite pairs i wear them all the time they 're very simple yet elegant and very well made especially for the price i will definitely buy more from this company	17
1	i got this for my mother at christmas and she loved it you ca n't help but notice the pendant when she has it on very beautiful design sleek and stylish she gets compliments everytime she wears it even though this was just an extra gift i think it turned out to be one of her favorite things	17
1	i 've had the watch for a week now and i'm very happy with it both digital and analog time are exact to the second after a week \( checked against apple network time server \) the watch looks good and i ca n't say i 've had a problem with the digital display if it was brighter i think it would tend to be distracting the slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1 of buyers will actually use it one small negative point i have noticed is that although the hands are luminous the hour markers are n't which makes things a little tricky in complete darkness a silly oversight hence 4 stars overall though well worth the money	17
1	i have been wearing this watch for last 6 months no complaints loved the adjust o matic bracelet great buy	17
0	this watch was a disappointment it has a huge dial but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny it 's also an extremely flashy watch the image on the web site makes it look classy not so additionally the watch is completely useless under low light conditions it neither fluoresces nor does it have a light up function returned it after a week got my money back	17
1	i got these today and was so shocked when they arrived wow these are amazing hoops for 25 dollars i am more than pleased do n't have an idea what some of the other reviewers were complaining about i am floored at the price and the quality at the same time with free shipping these are a must great gift idea and everyday earrings amazon got them to me in a matter of 4 days and i'm in hawaii they also came beautifully packaged i'm in love with them do n't let these sell out	17
1	my boyfriend found this watch at a retail store put it on his christmas list i purchased it at amazon at a much better price this was a replacement watch for an old timex watch my boyfriend says he loves this watch no complaints at all he says the buttons are easier to push than those on his old watch he especially likes the large easy to read display	17
1	i bought this gift for my sister in law and it was beautiful it is high quality and looks great	17
0	i bought these for my mom she was very excited about them when looking at the picture online when they arrived they turned out to be a big disappointment the entire earring is tiny the pink stones so small they hardly stand out against the silver from not very far away at all they just look like a gray blob very hard to tell what shape not impressed i suggest you look for something else i will be returning these immediatel	17
1	this is a great watch ! ! ! ! it feels heavy it 's big it looks awesome with a blue shirt and it will distinguish you in any crowd ! you can wear it as a dress watch or with a sports shirt it just looks great ! the best fossil i 've ever bough	17
0	daylight savings time in the us has changed these watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules while you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks twice a year it kind of defeats the whole purpose	17
1	watch is the best on the market i've had it a month now and love it the compliments keep coming in and amazon's price was the lowest i could find anywhere both on the net and at the discount stores if you want to cath the ladies eyes this is the watch for you	17
0	the quality is not so good i also got a smaller carat than i bought i contacted the seller for a return but they are not cooperative and did not provide information on how to return the item looks like i will dispute the charge on my credit card beware	17
1	i have been looking for a bracelet for what seems to be years never found the right style size design combination to fit until now this bracelet looks great on the wrist it is well constructed and very comfortable to wear with no pinching i'm giving it the full 5 stars without any hesitation	17
1	i believe the heart shaped locket is a one of a kind thing it is appropriately sized to allow for sufficient size pictures while not being too large the silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures due to the size of the locket a dainty smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket therefore while i was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews i took a risk and am happy with this purchase the pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection good gift sincerely the guy who usually blows it on the valentine 's day gift	17
1	this watch is a delightful present amazon did a great job in delivering it on time and in excellent condition and as stated in the previous review it does look better than even on the picture ! keep up the fantastic work amazon you guys are a great realiable trustworthy source to send out gifts to loved ones in the us ordered from outside the us	17
1	this skagen watch is full of class yet it 's perfect for casual wear too very thin so it 's not clunky like a lot of other watches titanium black and the band is black metal as well had to bend the clasp a bit to get it to hold but now it 's perfect and because it 's not an expansion braclet it 's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist i hope to have this for years to come because i 've not seen anything like it and the price is right too	17
1	even if you are not buy this watch i am a nurse much like many of the other reviewers in fact i bought it due to their reviews it is a fantastic watch easy to read has an illumination option and a handy date feature the only trouble i have is the size of the band \( too long \) i will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out however the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy \( it 's not \) do n't even bother looking for another watch this one is a steal	17
0	the chain was very thin and fragile the locket itself stopped closing properly within 3 days i plan to send it back for a refund pretty but piece of junk	17
1	i got this watch one week ago its very good looking watch its 85 but looks like 150 watch all of my friends are asking about this watch as it catches others eye very easily it upper dial \( having number 05 15 25 etc \) rotates clock wise this is a functionality to keep the time accurate while fast driving its bit heavy but now i am used to it i would recomend this watch to everyone who like heavy looking watches on their wrist	17
0	i love the actually pendent the time it got there was great but i really did n't like how they show the pendent on a chain because i bought it for the whole package \( chain included \) so when i got it i was shocked that it did n't included it so buyers beware this supplier does n't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra 15 30 even thou they adversities it in their ad	17
1	service was great ring is beautiful and of good quality it was set promptly	17
1	love my new watch ! it is very thin and comfortable i get compliments every time i wear it	17
1	this is so cute and if you are a pig collector you need to add him to your collection the blue eyes and rhinestone ears are what make it nice pink color not too bright or too dull and so small it 's cute the little compartment can fit a few rings or earrings in it very very nice	17
1	i love the jewel jet because it is exactly what my jeweler uses except now i can clean my diamond at home when i want it is easy to use just follow the directions	17
1	exceptional value in a classy and understated design keeps time in a superior fashion highly recommended	17
1	very light weight appropriately sized not too gaudy or flashy accurate so far reasonably priced pretty much everything i was after in a watch	17
1	this is a very nice affordable watch i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will always be accurate people who own 1000 watches ask me about it a lot when i tell them that it is solar powered and automatically synchronizes with an atomic clock every night and that i only paid 60 for it while on sale from amazon they immediately tell me that they paid too much for their expensive inferior watches	17
1	i bought this watch to replace an older similar model it is simple and functional perfect for being both a timepiece and a running watch the functions are easy to use and the indiglo feature is crucial for nighttime training	17
1	great product for the price espeacially for a starter set fear not you cant go wrong here	17
1	my roommate got this for his girlfriend and after examining his girlfriend 's ears i have decided that these earrings are great for the price not something you want to give your wife but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young \( or old \) girlfriend with an entry level nice gift they are a decent size and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance recommended	17
1	i ordered this watch initially as a gift for someone and when i received it i loved the look and feel of it so much that i quickly ordered another just for myself it 's a very sleek looking watch very lightweight on your wrist and the price on amazon here is at lear 40 below what i have seen it go for regular retail price in the more upscale stores in the malls i intend to use this watch for special occasions as i believe it will complement dressier attire	17
1	well this is the watch band that i originally had on my seiko watch i searched the internet to find a replacement amazon had it for a good price i ordered it and got it in the mail three days later	17
0	as title says there were kind of a water mark on the face of the watch maybe a leak from the solar panel \? i did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch no point paying shipping back and forth anyways the instructions were easy to understand buttons on the side a little bit hard to push blue led on red face looks bad because of the dark face for the solar panel it is not easy to see this watch is now sitting on my desk collecting dust i am just waiting to see when the solar panel stop leaking and the watch fail	17
1	the watch arrived promptly and was exactly what i expected a very nice everyday watch for a good price	17
1	could not have gotten a better deal it has been working for the last 2 months very quite i leave it in the bedroom ca n't beat the price recommended for those automatic watch lovers you can buy 4 of these for the price of an others model	17
1	these earrings are a gift for the upcoming holidays i think the person receiving them will really like them they are a great color and are a nice size i would totally recommend these	17
0	i 've had three of these watches but the band loosens up and falls off with no way to put it back on its ridiculus b c seems like the band worsens in water and this is supposed to be fore triathlons however the interval counter is a great feature but whats the point of having a watch that the band wont last more than a year or two	17
1	i was concerned the stone would stick up too high on my finger instead it 's the perfect height i was concerned about ordering off the internet but i'm very pleased with the speed of service and the quality of the topaz is very good	17
1	it 's a fantastic watch a little heavy and bit of work is required to adjust the band overall the nice blue background stands out quite nicely it 's on the money with keeping time too	17
1	this is a gift that has yet to be given i am confident that she will love them though	17
1	they are small but sparkly and look very cute my 15 year old loves it and wear it every day	17
0	i bought this winder for my husband because of the price but it is so loud ! ! ! ! we had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom i would n't recommend this i guess sometimes you get what you pay for	17
1	this watch is generally a good watch but there are some flaws in ours not a surprise considering the price one there is a white haze under the crystal when viewed in the sunlight perhaps the result of careless manufacturing and cleaning two my son has had the band come apart twice in one month the later probably a design issue relative to all the spring loaded retainers and such and the general range of movement of the clasp	17
1	this is a must have watch for serious runners i have had mine for over a month and i love mine i am a professional track and field athlete and i train very hard to win races this watch helps me train better than any other watch i 've ever had it gives you up to 50 lap splits which are great for any workout that is over 800 meters on a track not only that but it has 5 interval timers which you can set your appropriate rest time on if you are a serious runner like myself i highly suggest you get this watch it is definately something that you will need	17
0	the earrings looked so pretty in the picture in real life they look cheap they look like plastic not like crystal very disappointed	17
1	it 's a beautiful necklace and it was worth the cost it 's not filmsy or cheap it 's durable and great	17
1	what a great buy ! beautiful and high quality watch for a great price it is probably an older version of the seiko coutura watch but it really does not matter	17
1	these are dainty and somewhat small but lovely to wear to work diamonds are a nice clear quality	17
1	the watch itself looks preety elegant however the bracelet is a bit too rigid and it cand be very unconfortable until you get used to it i do n't regret buying it it 's worth the money	17
1	i live in eastern pennsylvania about 1600 1700 miles away from the atomic time signal station and this watch syncs fine right on my bureau 4 feet from a window and in a watch case when i received the watch the battery indicator was on medium after about 30 minutes or less on a sunny windowsill it achieved full charge i'm quite pleased with it	17
1	prompt delivery good quality well worth the price actually just the right size for all occasions many complements on them thank you kathi abbot	17
1	i ordered a pair for myself and liked them stones are pretty clear n cute but earrings are smaller than shown in the picture	17
1	bought this as a gift for my brother he was impressed by the quality and feel of the watch he wears it so i think i did pretty good considering he 's a tough person to buy something for	17
0	i bought this to change my watch battery tools broke after using it once worthless complete waste of money on this cheap toolkit	17
0	this watch is lightweight and elegant in appearance but the clasp loosened repeatedly in ordinary wear i returned the item for credit	17
1	as soon as i saw this watch i had to get it i loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful it 's a really nice looking and good quality watch the only problem i do have with it is that the face is quite big if you have a small wrist it is very large i still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller	17
1	i bought this along with the butterfly pendant and 18 chain for a christmas gift \( 06 \) for my god daughter and she loves them both i loved the price ! the earrings are a perfect fit with the necklace she says she only wears them to church and special occasions a great gift for teenage girls	17
0	this item was a nice gift the stones were a little discolored but that 's what you get for only paying 100 for 1 4 carat earings online	17
0	this pendant is on the cheap looking side but you get what you pay for i guess	17
1	we finally have a stopwatch that fufills our every need the display was so large all i had to do was merely glance down i 've gone through several stopwatches but this one is the most durable	17
1	my husband has really liked this watch so far the price was great for such a elegant looking watch he wears it when he dresses up he really likes that it is kinetic we do n't have to worry about replacing the battery the last watch i bought him was a fossil and we had to send it to their servicing center when the battery died and had to wait 4 6 weeks the kinetic seems to be working out great	17
1	this watch is beautiful i cannot say enough good things about this watchs design its 45mm face is bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy it keeps perfect time and is very light weight i bought the calibre 8700 before this one and i love both of them but i would give this one a slight edge my two small complaints are that this watch doesnt have the perpetual calender which is a very nice feature that the calibre 8700 does have and also that this watch uses mineral crystal for the face and not saphire i am sure the crystal used is scratch resistant but it is no where near as resistant as saphire crystal would be	17
1	nice quality it is a shame that they do not have the same in longer cords as well	17
1	i purchased this watch as a christmas gift for my husband he was quite surprised and pleased by the atomic solar features and replaceable watch band the watch is a little bulky and fits a bit tight under his sleeves on his dress work shirts overall very pleased and a great value	17

1	the watch is just as discribed it is heavy and large the person i bought it for had to get several links removed it would be great for a larger man	17
0	i ordered a swarovsky crystal pendant which i thought was clear like one i had purchased once on a visit to a swarovsky factory the one i received is clear but not like the first one it is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one i was disappointed	17

0	i purchased this watch as a birthday present for my husband when he opened it he noticed that the days of the week were in both spanish and english and there does n't seem to be a way to set it to just one or the other since there were limited instructions with the watch by the time he looked at it there was no way for us to return it for a refund not happ	17

1	the item ordered was shipped promptly and was exactly as described no problems whatsoever	17
0	the watches looked very cheap could not gift it to friends	17
1	my last ironman lasted 12 years of very hard usage in the restaurant business lots of heat grease and water ! my new timex combo dual tech watch has all the same features especially the timers which i can set at different intervals you ca n't beat the price for this rugged but sleak looking watch a plus it has both digital time and good old watch hands	17
1	original concept it generates imagination through the different colors and designs the child can create and is a reliable watch too ! all that for an afordable price	17
1	sometimes you realize you need a watch but do n't want to spend a fortune something that 'll last long is solid yet fashionable and easy to use this watch has it all many times girls have stopped me to see this watch it is sophisticated stylish and only 85 no matter where you go the metal stays shiny the glass virtually scratch proof days of the week military time day of month \( problem with this is it does not know if month is 30 days or 31 so u have to set it yourself sometimes but rarely and worth the effort \) i highly reccomend this watch to everyone	17
0	i bought this watch about 7 months ago and had all the issues listed to some degree or anouther but all in all it was still a good watch for the price that is untill 5 days ago when all the digital functions on the watch quit and then a day later went blank leaving me with a standard watch but i guess you get what you pay for	17

0	most of the items were fine they were just given as gifts with 4 damaged i have tried to return without success i am disappointed that i am not able to return damaged or not functioning items i may think twice about ever doing this agai	17
1	bought several of these bracelets for christmas gifts ! they were a big hit ! perfect for someone who need a little pick me up	17
0	the pendant is nice however the pewter wrap around kind of ruins the entire design it does not go with the center design i think it would look better with a slightly tarnished silver look pewter is just too dull for this design and the necklace does not work well with the pendant either	17
1	absolutely beautiful piece of jewelry i bought it for a young man as a birthday gift and he has worn it every day since ! unique and eye catching	17
1	i purchased this watch for three reasons 2 time zones backlighting constant display of day of week month day did not disappoint looks cool i bought this watch on the basis of the other earlier reviews very accurate account of the features and performance i wear it for everyday use	17
1	this ring is absolutely gorgeous and i havent taken it off since recieving it but when buying this ring be careful not to take the string off of the bands this string protects you from well insanity i unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands luckily i found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it my dad put it back together and it was fine but i have to admit i'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off if this does happen to you google puzzle ring solutions and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal	17
1	it is a good watch under 200 price range if you buy it you will love it forever one thing i hate is little bit heavy but not a big deal \)	17
1	it is a nice watch for the dollar spent on this item the catch is that it will work with the concept of wave ceptor and it adjusts time according to the place you are in so good watch !	17
1	the bracelet looks more expensive than it is i like wearing it	17
0	the earrings are very pretty but the posts arrived bent the material for the post is too soft	17
1	i am very pleased with the locket it is a nice size but not too big definitely large enough to be engraved the chain is pretty and appears to be strong it arrives in a lovely black velvet pouch and box my daughter was delighted with it	17
1	do n't buy this watch unless you want it \( and your good taste \) to be admired it 's just beautiful sort of like man jewelry for guys that do n't wear jewelry but i plan to wear it only when i wear certain clothing to certain events i have other watches for other situations	17
1	i was searching for a watch for weeks saw a picture of this watch and paused intrigued i began to read the specs alarm chronograph thermometer light stopwatch world time zones and more what 's the catch \? 55usd c'mon seriously with all those features is that all \? i was still skeptical but when i got the watch put it on my wrist i was sold solid well crafted unique sporty elegant combination my only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature we ca n't have the world but casio has come close with this price i can honestly say go for it	17
1	for the price this is a great buy ! colors are good has a nice weightto it ! would buy more from this merchant	17
0	i have purchased eight of these units over the past year two of the eight have stopped working altogether and this morning one of the turntables on a third unit now fails to revolve the seller replaced the first unit that failed and when i requested replacement of the second unit i was told that it has been replaced by a newer model with vertical stacking and more timing features they could not offer the new model to me in exchange but they did offer a 20 discount it arrived today and seems to be working well if you are considering purchasing any unit made by this manufacturer \( garnin \) consider it as suitable for short term use rather than long term usage	17
0	product is not as pictured looks like a dimestore fake i had purchased this for one of my bridesmaids and now have to spend more money to buy her something else i would not give this to a 4 year old let alone a 34 year old i am very disappointed ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	17
1	this is probably one of the lightest smallest watches with an interval timer feature which is why i got it it 's also pretty cheap it has a decent number of other options as well this particular seller had the cheapest price with the most recent model very quality	17
1	if you are trying to buy a decent set of pearls and do n't really have a good frame of referance these are for you my wife was a jewler and she likes pearls i bought these and got positive feedback i was nervous but when they showed they were heavy and looked great you will be ok if you go with these	17
1	these earrings are great they are the perfect size i would recommend these to anyone who likes a classic look	17
0	beautiful color but very small in size i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the pictur	17
1	this is a lovely necklace but the pendant part is smaller than it looks in the picture very pretty overall	17
1	they sparkle well and look as good as anything else i have seen at the mall stores i like the non cup style studs as i think they allow more light to flow through the stone save your cash and get these she will be very happy and you can spend the extra money on fishing lures or something \) do not go to jared 's jewelers if they are near you they are evil people	17
1	this is a very nice piece i 've been looking for a key pendant for a while now but all the ones i 've seen have been very feminine and this one while slightly satanic fits nicely to the meaning i wanted without making me feel like a fairy princess shipping even got here early ! my only problem with it is having to pull out the pliers to get it to fit on a different neck piece from the same seller 4 5	17
1	this is my second one of these winders so obviously i'm a fan winds my rolexes and a few other eta autos perfectly but it does n't seem to keep my seiko kinetic diver or panerais wound sufficiently still as far as i'm concerned it spreads the lubrication enough to keep the watches in good health for the price point this winder cannot be beat and i will purchase more in the future the auto timer keeps the winder running cool fairly silent rotation depending on the watch while the gear rotations themselves are completely silent sometimes there 's a slight shift of the watch as it goes around which makes a repetitive sound nothing i ca n't live with highly recommended	17
1	i bought this watch as a gift for a friend who requested this exact one he loves it personally the lights that come on and off far too frequently for no reason would be a little too much for me it is certainly the largest wrist watch i have come across but if this is what you 're looking for and knowing that it is a g shock which makes it a great watch this is the one for you	17
1	actually i ordered this necklace for my best friend 's birthday and she loved she is a very stylish woman so i am so thankful for this product it is worth every cent i paid and i am thinking to buy one for myself too	17
1	timex ironman has been my kind of watch for long time now great watch to wear anytime	17
0	not as they appear ! march 8 2007reviewer rappster \( denver co \) see all my reviewsi ordered these earrings on a 'gold box' special and waited eagerly for them to arrive they were such a disappointment i returned them the next day i did not expect the diamonds to be huge based on their cttw but the earrings themselves are miniscule ! they look like they were made for children i tried on one earring and could n't even see the earring in my ear much less tell there were any diamonds it looked like i did n't even have an earring on !	17
0	i loved these earrings and at the price i thought they 'd be great however when i got them i quickly discovered that the back for one of the pair was too loose to actually stay on the earring within two days the earring had fallen out and i have yet to find it there 15 down the drain	17
1	i purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers i found that it is effective to show many of my pieces and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional very professional looking and easy to carry around if you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled but i do n't believe it is intended for that purpose	17
1	i love the look and function of this watch but guys if you have any hair on your wrists be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band i 've had 3 other fossil watches and never had this problem i think fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one ouch !	17
1	this invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems all metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly and the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion \( hard to read in direct light \) also who needs a 24h dial on a chronograph \( instead of a 1 10s dial \) \? but overall for this price a good deal and good looking	17
0	battery died within a month i had already gotten rid of the packaging	17
1	i wear this watch every day and i usually work outside i am very pleased with the features and the durability it seemed daunting to work the features at forst but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy i have only two complaints one is that the metal band has developed a slight squeak when i move my wrist sometimes the tin man needs oil the second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night the watch does not always get the time signal from ft collins i have gone as long as several days without getting it but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all i am ok with the spotty reception	17
0	i love my new canon a710 large lcd makes taking pictures easy to frame color and sharpness is good all around and needing only 2 aa batteries is great i no longer need to search and buy special camera batteries i can go into any drug store only draw back on this camera is the size of the memory card 16mb for a few bucks more put in at least a 1gig overall rating for a camera in this price range above average	1
0	it was everything it advertised as being i can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras being a slingshot backpack my back does n't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags i like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack	1
0	this is a pretty accurate radar gun for baseball as far as i can tell if you follow the directions and are as close to the action as possible and at a straight on angle it looks like its correct in the 1 mph statement however this is a cool gadget but if you are serious about speed and would like more versatility then your going to have to go with the official mlb jugs gun but at a much higher price good luck	1
0	i bought this camera for my sister as an early christmas present thinking i would need some time to set it up for her well in less then 30 minutes i was ready it 's a awesome camera i was impressed of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 sd card i have sent the site to another sister whom is interested it is the easiest camera to use and has features that will impress anyone great photos from very close to far away i would recommend this camera to anyone	1
1	i bought this item for 40 online and then found out my canon camera didnt need a cannon brand charger and i could have bought one for 10 instead in total i spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling not worth it go to another store and by one for 10	1
1	keep in mind that you ca n't use this product unless you buy an external flash the built in flash results in harsh shadows on the left edge of the photos canon 's responsethank you for your inquiry regarding the powershot g6 we are sorry to hear of any issues with the conversion lens when using the built in flash a portion of the image may be blocked by the converters and appear dark please refer to page 186 of the camera manual for detailed information when the converters are used it is recommended to not use the built in flash thank you for choosing canon	1
0	i think is a must for any beginner for a low price you can have almost all the different size of ep try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the ep that you need	1
0	i dropped the camera from 2 feet and the metal outer rim of the lens slightly became bent and wo n't close after some time spent tring to bend the metal back in place i finally was able to close the lens besides that it is an awesome camera i am able to pick out a color \( ex red \) and take a picture with that color standing out and everything else black and white no photoshop needed	1
0	i went the \( thinking it was cheaper \) ebay route for about 10 more i got a new one here and it works ebay is nice but when it comes to stuff like this i learned my lesson i 've never gone wrong ordering from amazon in fact i just ordered an oem nb 3l battery for my sd500 tried the radio slop route and it wo n't go over 20 pictures again shame on me for trying to go cheap	1
1	the worst thing for this is you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every 20 min if you are capturing hd video i think most of buyers would take hd video if you buy a hd camcorder but a small disc can only hold 20 min hd video have to change disc time by time the cmos sensor is worse than ccd but it is the best sensor among cmos in this price today a lot of noise will come in low light condition ! i bought it for 800 and return it i think you 'd better buy sr1 with a 30g hard drive that would be a much better one !	1
0	the quality is definitely great when attached to the s3 is it makes your camera look serious about taking good shots if you are attaching the hood and doing flash photography i suggest you use a slave flash to eliminate the shadow caused by the hood	1
0	over the years i have been using quantum turbo and later 2x2 units \( no turbo sc yet \) to power various canon speed lights from 540ez to ex580 with some skepticism i picked this unit as a trial on one wedding assignment well although quantum units still have a place in my kit to power metz unit i love the convenience of cp e3 one recommendation buy couple of extra battery inserts if you do lot of fast shootings and keep them loaded with good quality duracell nimh 's	1
0	i bought this filter for my 28 135 is canon lens and so far it has worked out great unlike some of the other tiffen filters i bought this one fits just right on the lens all sides are even and it sits flush against the lens i have n't noticed any artifacts from pictures i 've taken yet but i have n't really had much of a chance to take many pictures with the lens the night shots i 've take so far i 've been quite pleased with however	1
0	yes it is a very fine lens is and 105 mm long end are also appealing but after buying this i decided to sell it in favour of my ef 24 70 2 8l after 2 weeks of usage f4 makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier bokeh is also worse than the other one the viewfinder gets darker in 1 6 crop bodies 105 mm does make a very little difference in image size plus the macro option is weaker on this one if you do n't care about the weight go with the ef 24 70 2 8l imho	1
0	i purchased this bag to carry my hp photosmart digital camera and photo printer along with 100pk 4 x 6 photo paper power cord and two chargers that each hold 4 aa batteries and i still have room left i'm very pleased	1
0	i bought this camera for my 80 year old mother because i knew that if she was going to try digital photography it had to be easy ! the printer dock is simple for her to use to transfer snapshots of her cat to her computer and email them to her friends i have used the older cx 7300 \( very similar camera \) for backpacking for years and it has never failed under harsh conditions the lack of optical zoom is a plus for me less to break the c530 is more compact has better resolution and still has the option of using aa batteries when the rechargables die if you want simple digital snapshots you will love this little camera	1
1	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
0	i had the tokina 12 24 f4 and it was a great sharp lens this canon focuses faster and is wider if you 're worried about full frame in the future do n't be just buy this lens and enjoy the ultra wide images it light fast and sharp l quality pictures the build could be better but i do n't see any problems down the road	1
1	cons only no pros the velcro closure is week and opens easilyterrible lookthe side zippers are a mistery totally uselessno space for extra memory or batteryattaches only to a very small beltthe flash opens spontaneously while inserting the camera in its pouch making it difficult to get it out later on and probably damaging the flash	1
1	the documentation is terrible its going to take a lot of practice if you 're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine however i want to use it off camera to trigger 2 x sb600s just setting the d200 to fire a pre flash that will trigger the sb800 masster sb600s it 's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail in the manual the sb800 is designed for this purpose so why not include information on how to do this \?	1
1	ordered two frames from the third party source neither on of them worked at all it has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund	1
1	good motor drive speed grip feel takes nikon lenses reacts fast to pressing the shutter release bad skin tone renditions a color other than skin white balance does n't balance well noise at anything above iso 200 looks like 3200 cf card door tough to open screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot battery cover is not part of the battery button placement not as intuitive as on the d100 4 1mp allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements dumped mine a month after i got it	1
1	i guess i really should n't complain because my husband won the camera in an office rally but the pictures it takes are disgraceful for a samsung product every two to three pictures are blurred unrecognizably where you ca n't even tell what you have taken if you have found yourself among the fortunate few who actually found success with this camera thank your lucky stars even if it is a less expensive choice versus the other cameras on the market today spend the extra money it would be worth it not to miss any family moments like my family did on this useless piece of crap	1
1	the main reason i ordered this kit was for the battery when i received it no battery included i contacted amazon and all they could do was give me a number for sony customer service thanks amazon ! !	1
1	so i get my camera and first off they basically lie because they act like you have a lot of memory on it to start off but you dont then after a week it just stops working dont get it theres no flash whatsoeve	1
0	i bought a canon powershot a70 they say your best camera is the one you use most and man i use it i'm a high schooler so i dont have much money but with the a70 i can attach this adapter \( la dc52c \) to my camera and i can have more photographic freedom with lenses for alot less money you have to have this adapter first then any lense which fits \( most \) can be used good idea canon ! ! !	1
1	purchased this item in dec 06' screen burned out mar 07' on top of that screen quality was not that great do not order order this item	1
1	this camera was great at first and very easy to use however the condensation error many others seem to have came true for us as well when we first got the error it had not been anywhere near any water or moisture so we put it in our cedar chest \( we keep our house very dry and do n't live in a humid area nebraska \) this worked for a few months but the error is now on permanently and the camera is useless i wish it was different but bottom line this is a disposable video camera a nice one but still disposable	1
0	i use my canon 10d mainly for astrophotography most of the time it involves keeping the camera shutter open for long periods oftime anywhere from a few minutes to tens of minutes this ack e2adapter takes my worries away from monitoring battery status or adrained one while i control the camera remotely sitting inside myhouse continuous power also ensures worry free writes to its flashstorage the package included several ac power connectors which isvery useful while travelling amazon provides a wide range of itemsto choose from	1
1	i bought this recharger kit specifically for a sandisk m230 mp3 player when i first received the kit i charged all of the batteries upon first use i only got 7min out of each battery when i got 20 hrs from the batter sent with the player i learned online that the batteries still have their charge but due to the battery 's memory effect or voltage depression my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min if you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much juice is left in a battery do not buy this kit	1
0	i'm a long time canon user and love the cameras but the lack of image stabilization on this one has me looking for an upgrade i can take decent pictures but if anyone else uses this camera the pictures are fuzzy take a look at one of the newer canons with image stabilization and i think you 'll be happier	1
1	bought the camera on a recommendation and also what looked like good specs on the web owned it for less than two weeks when the lcd screen cracked \( below the surface of the protective cover \) turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras panasonic will not warranty fix this ! if you do get one or own one be very careful not to use the left nav button if you do be very careful on the pressure you apply this is the camera 's glass jaw and you might end up bricking a brand new camera i am replacing mine with a canon	1
1	i bought the meade captureview 8x42 1 3mp digital camera binocular the first one had software hardware that hung up after 3 pictures the second one had so many pixels missing from the screen it was unreadable the third one wouldnt turn on and the black side flashing fell off on removal from the box a truely tatty product	1
1	i bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over exposed i have n't changed anything or done anything i have no idea what 's wrong with the camera but given the price i'm pretty annoyed and amazon com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days	1
0	i purchased this camera a year ago \( summer 05 \) definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect there are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera but after a year mine is still working perfectly	1
1	this is another example of how sony is alienating its customer base not only will it not work with standard sd memory like everyone else it does not include a docking station you have to shell out more money for that option i dont think so	1
0	excelent battery ! i recommend it for all olympus slr digital cameras i am using it on my e300 and you can take a lot of pictures in one day i have 2 batteries because of outdoors shoots and this is really enough	1
1	i purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her this is the first time i have ever been disappointed with a product i purchased from amazon it was in my opinion not worth the price i paid ! the picture looked much larger that it actually was i wil continue to purchase through amazon but i will be much more careful and definitely return it if i'm not satisfied in this case i did not have time to find another camera case thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion linda sutto	1
1	i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them	1
1	i bought this lens and was pretty excited about it but i 've been disappointed previous to this i bought the 50mm 1 8 for 70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame i need a wider angle lens and went for this one but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible even at higher f stops i shoot with a 20d the usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one the focal range of 28 105 was also very nice but to me the picture quality was not so good	1
0	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens at 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
0	got this camera because a friend had a similar one the blue tooth feature is just great you need a memory card to make if you want to take video 's and store a lot of photos the video 's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size all in all a great buy	1
1	i loved my 4 1mp sony cypershot i got for christmas in 2005 then a few days after christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it if i would tap the camera they would go away but then a few days later i was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working it would turn on but then shut off i had this problem before with low batteries but i changed them and it still did n't work it would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out so many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use so sad camera dea	1
0	i am a female bowhunter who really had trouble judjing distances on green fields this is a great product it is easy to use and very accurate	1
0	an excellent purchase that lives up to the sony name my main concern before buying it was that it would swivel enough that i could point my mini camera straight down to take macro photos of documents it does this easily and the legs do n't get in the way it 's small enough to chuck in my backpack and take it all the time in case i need it and it has its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so that it does n't get tangled up in anything else overall i would rate it as excellent	1
1	date on still photo will not print it 's no good where yoy need that type of info on the printed photo	1
0	this case fits the z650 perfectly by just removing the inner piece	1
0	love this battery long lasting and just as good as the name brand	1
0	this is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier canon digital elph that i lost several years ago the 7 1 megapixels ensures great quality and the 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures in fact the digital zoom also works great just make sure the camera is steady \( i purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome \) although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have you ca n't beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes the canon sd500 is a great little camera	1
0	camera arrived earlier than i expected and was just what i wanted very small but versitle large screen very satified with my purchase	1
0	great flash all the good qualities of the sb800 but less of the data dump and decision quagmire ! it has the built in flash disperser its lighter than the 800 so unless you 're into more info than you need go with the sb600 oh it has a shorter recycle time too	1
1	i bought this camera to mainly use the digital macro mode it worked great for several months now it will not lock focus this camera is very frustrating every picture that i take i have to edit to lighten the picture i tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out to no avail i am a commercial real estate appraiser so i have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera and just about every one i had to lighten now the macro mode wont work i will not buy another cannon product ever again ! !	1
1	i bought this camera for christmas and it is absolutely horrible ! it takes really bad quality pictures and it has a very noisy lens it 's a great looking camera but the screen is only 2 inches which is very small this camera is not a good buy for it 's class	1
1	you have this camera case listed under accessories for the panasonic dmc fa20pp lumix camera the camera does not come close to fitting in this case the camera is 1 1 2 inches wider than the case	1
0	very happy with the lens and the price is definately right for an amateur like myself	1
1	i bought this camera a year ago the camera is goog only for outdoor use with a lot of light but for using indoor \( with flash \) is very very bad when you use flash the photo are not good but if you go to beach this may be a regular choice if you can bought another camera	1
0	i was very happy with the product it serves me well fast delivery good service by the vender i got the project done and it will serve me well on into the future great travel storage case heavy plastic unit good quality light stands	1
1	i had an older canon camcorder that i was very happy with so i decided to get this new one i ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud i even tried the same model at best buy to make sure it was n't just a defective camera but compared to a similar sony model the canon was noticeably louder while operating way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions	1
0	all i can say is if you know what you 're doing \( basic knowledge in digital photography \) you 'll love this camera adobe photoshop would be nice to have too if you like to play around with the pictures to make it more better have fun	1
0	i recently purchased this camera and i'm loving it as a whole it 's very easy to use and carry i'm a college student going into photograpy and this is a great starter camera i have a feeling this one is going to be with me for a very long time	1
1	i purchased this for my 10 yr old son i was surprised at how well cheap it appeared we took it out of the box and turned it on and it would not work at first then it worked for about 10 minutes then it never worked again and we had to return it amazon was great during the return process and refunded our money quickly we ended up buying the dgx 5 1 mp from a local store i it 's place it has worked well for my son and is holding up to the rigors of youth not a professional photography instrument but a pretty decent unit for him	1
0	after owning and using the camera for a month or so now i am delighted with it i have only replaced the batteries one time so do n't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for small lightweight many features choice of 6 meg 5 4 3 2 and 1 meg photos at fingertips what i really decided on this camera for was the macro capability as i take photos of very small coins and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that it preforms magnificantly my previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle i love the samsung digimax s600	1
0	i'm using it for a few months now i have n't found a single problem so far earlier i was using an old finepix and the optic sensor sensitivity was not very good poor quality of photos taken in dark environment this is not a problem any more also i was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom in general i was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out \) sure there are better cameras on the market however considering the price it is just a great deal	1
0	this lens is amazing nothing escapes it it 's like a black hole clearly the best lens i have ever owned it 's like the lidless eye of sauron from the lord of the rings it is heavy and requires rethinking how you hold the camera it comes with a beautiful case a hood and a tripod mount on the lens believe me you will need it i took a few photos of my son from 250 feet away and they look great i will now get to work reading the small manual it has 2 focal settings and 2 stabilizing settings wow !	1
1	my husband and i bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting due to weather the snorkeling was canceled but we did end up using the cameras one we used for regular pictures outdoor only beacuse there 's no flash and it was okay though the pictures were a bit grainy the other i took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll i could turn and turn the winder and the film would n't advance but it would let me take another picture after fighting with it the entire weekend i ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out though these were grainy too	1
1	this camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market after purchase we were never able to retreive pictures the computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download it not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child the instructions are complicated and eventually you give up even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver \( the smallest one you can find \) to achieve it unfortunately i have wasted my money but luckily you do n't have to	1
1	i ordered this digital frame for my husband for christmas with the assurance from a tech weenie that it would work based on the advertisement found at amazon still uncertain whether the ad \( also found in philips cursory literature \) is really true my husband is working with the phone people at philips to determine whether it will or will not interface with mac if it does eventually work the process has not been easy	1
0	i gave this camera 5 stars because of it 's awesome features this camera is the perfect size for kids and you can put a video on this camera i love this camera i think it takes awesome pictures	1
1	not worth the 10 i paid especially when i had to spend 7 to ship it ! !	1
1	i loved this camera when i got it but after three months the lens would not close it makes grinding noises the canon logo pops up on the screen then shuts off again i am very disappointed in this camera	1
0	this is a very flexible and capable camera if you are looking for more than a point shoot will offer there are very few that would compare for me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing the 16 9 is an ok feature if you plan on hdtv veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to 4 3 i would prefer a larger screen and lose the 16 9 feature the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside i am very satisfied	1
1	i ordered this tripod and it arrived broken the assembly to which a camera is attached is made out of plastic i asked for an rma order via e mail and they only gave me an address to mail it back to with a 'copy of the invoice 'being lazy about mailing things back and since it was cheap to begin with i tried repair it myself where it broke \( the three plastic rings on the camera mount \) it was impossible to re glue because of the torsion placed on those rings with any sort of pressure even if your tripod arrives un broken it will likely break the first time you drop it on the camera mount from any height at all	1
1	i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective	1
1	i paid extra for air next day service item was advertised as available and ready to ship immediately item eventually arrived two weeks later i had left for a trip item was eventually sent back to merchant merchant did n't credit me for item returned i had to email merchant and wait for another 2 weeks before item was credited i wo n't buy from willoughby 's again	1
1	in an email adorama specified that the filter diameter was 28mm on the amazon com website is states that the same filter is a 55mm filter mounting ! either they do n't know their products or they do n't care about the customers now i have to return it because of faulty information they supplied please beware that their shipping charges equal approximately 25 of the purchase price an amount i feel is beyond absurd i can buy this locally for a lot less \( even though i would have to pay sales tax \) buyer beware	1
0	good product probably the best digital frame in the market drawbacks are the user interface and the difficulty to set up the wireless connection	1
0	i purchased this camera so i could photograph wildlife on hikes i needed something that was not too heavy was image stabilized with telephoto power this camera meets all those requirements it does have one problem however in bright light the viewfinder blanks out so one cannot clearly see the object to be photographed i have solved that problem to some extent by pointing the camera at the object and letting the autofocus do the rest this fix has resulted in many excellent photos like many other small cameras the results tend to be contrasty and i modify this tendency in photoshop	1
1	unless they had n't insisted on the geared telescopic part it has some sort of swivel that is supposed to raise and lower it but the handle is the cheapest possible plastic and it broke the very first time i used it it 's extremely annoying because overall it 's not a bad tripod but it really did n't need that bit of hi tech and now i am unable to use the telescopic part at all yes it 's lightweight and somewhat unstable but i can live with that the biggest problem is the bad engineering and the subpar materials	1
1	it takes too long to focus and shoot ! this coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card well it is horrible people who write in saying they did n't notice the the slow focus and writing must be either paid by nikon or total nubs do not buy this camera it did take decent movies and the size is nice	1
0	this spotting scope from bushnell is an excellent buy if you are an outdoors person or if you like watching the world from your window you can even view the craters on the moon plus it 's waterproof and comes with two cases and a tripod the amazon price is the best deal on the internet	1
0	it seems surprising that canon would make a product out of anything but the best materials lensmate makes a superior product out of aluminum in black and silver	1
0	this is an elegant leather case for the canon elph cameras it fits in the pocket easily i'm satisfied	1
0	for an all purpose color film i nearly always shoot fuji 's 200 speed it has the cooler tones that i prefer in my images and a good saturation level the only drawback that i 've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over priced ! the only place that i 've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less and you wo n't have to wait for it to ship	1
1	this case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card it only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap there are other cases available with better features for less money	1
0	i have had my canon eos 30d for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted to photography i bought the 17 85mm canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post processing in raw i also have a 70 300mm lens for sports outdoors nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound i bought the camera through dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there ! strongly recommend pay the extra and get this over the rebel xti you wo n't be disappointed	1
0	bought this remote about a month ago it does what it says you can even use it from behind great little device for the price	1
1	this gets 1 star for the simple fact that it does n't seem to fit my mark ii body properly	1
0	i needed a tele lens to complement my d50 purchase a did n't want to spend too much money on it but i needed one that a least matched my lumix fz10 in sharpness this certainly did and the vr really works i am able to take sharp pictures up to 1 40 my d50 flies on it	1
0	this lens is great i 've been doing portraits and just random snapshots and it makes every picture beautiful ! the only downside is the lack of ability to zoom other than that it 's a great lens	1
1	unfortunately i had to return the unit because it was not designed to be used on a mac 10 4 program \( the tech at the company said he was not aware it was meant to be used by a mac	1
0	this diffuser is the same quality as the one that comes with the nikon sb 800 flash it is much better than other aftermarket diffusers that require velcro this is made to fit the sb 600 perfectly it snaps on and off easily angled at 75 degrees it provides excellent fill i use it on the sb 600 set up as a slave with the sb 800 for fill and back lighting it should have been included by nikon as original equipment but is inexpensive and cost effective much better than the built in plastic flat diffuser	1
1	very disappointed by canon on the fit of this adapter adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view andcreate flash shadows	1
1	this battery is not compatible with the the jvc grd270us video camera i did get a purchase price refund but i am out shipping costs both ways	1
0	i have been using my sony cybershot dscn1 8 1mp for about a month now it 's so easy to use and i love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen the only issue i have with it is that i ca n't use the memory pro stick with my sony photo printer \( a 5 year old model \) because the stick is not compatible ps do n't forget to buy a memory stick pro if you purchase this camera you 're gonna need it	1
0	i bought this sweet little thing because i am planning a day in nyc and do n't want to bring along my regular camera which is bulky this camera is nice and small and would fit in any purse or coat pocket it has 5 mp and a 3x optical zoom which is great for the price the pictures i took outside turned out outstanding inside pics were a bit pixelated but i may have had the settings wrong the camera is easy to use right out of the box perfect for a second camera to keep on you just in case	1
0	installing the software was a piece of cake using it is quite another matter the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles tweaks and options first attempts \? the moon came out real nice but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail nothing like type of pics that the super whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well \( oh was using it on a classic lx200 in good see'ing conditions sorry celestron !	1
1	i bought a sony icd mx20 digital voice recorder a week ago i was surprised that sony does not provide downloads of the associated software named digital voice editor sony customer service staff told me that if you lost the cd that came with the box you had to buy a new one only patches of the software are available to download the customer service personnel told me that it was corporate policy despite the fact that the software is bound to the digital device this immoral policy violating the norm of digital appliance industries and should not be encouraged sony is demoting its brand name by offering poor post sales services think twice before making your buying decision	1
0	very clear bright day strong magnification quality seems to be good very well priced at around 100 00 i will know more over the passage of time my firstimpression is good mj schra	1

1	i have an olympus fe 100 camera and the battery did not fit ! my niece has an olympus fe 140 camera and the battery did not fit in hers either ! the company does not accept returns on batteries that are opened so i was just out of luck	1
1	i have had both the s5000 and the s5100 i was disapointed when my s5000 power switch stopped working after 18 months but i was happy with the picture quality i replaced it with the s5100 it has a slightly better feature set over the s5000 \( in particular shutter speed choices \) while on a trip to niagara falls i was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt \( and i mean slight \) after that it would n't power up i am now looking for something a liitle more robust and reliable	1
1	i had jvc product and some of my friends too these are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly price may be less buy its not worth for long run i feel sony and canon are better than jvc even hitachi is good	1
1	in my opinion this is not a marketable product the cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work there is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix when it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit as for hd possibly at high noon in the sahara but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing	1
1	this camera is a piece of junk you have to be standing outside in bright sunlight to get a decent picture and then when you try to use the flash it is so bright that everything in the foreground of the picture is washed out not to mention the battery life is horrible i got a 1 gb memory card so i could take lots of pictures but the battery runs out after i took about 10 so all in all if you 're considering buying this thing save the money and frustration and just do n't	1
0	this is the same charger came with my digital rebel however i like to charge two batteries at a time so i bought a second charger and place them side by side on the power strip the prongs for the outlet fold over and into the back of the charger making the charger very compact flat and easy to take along with you it 's nice having a charger without long cords to fuss with	1
0	i really wanted a 3ccd model but since i'm just starting out and need to buy other stuff like a tripod monopod media firewire adapter card camera bag etc this fits the budget nicely and it is compact enough to carry it anywhere yes the usb connection does work yes firewire does work although it took me a minute to figure out that a connection problem was the fault of the video software version i was using not the fault of the camera	1
1	i bought these binoculars because i wanted a medium size pair to use primarily for birding first time out i had difficulty getting a clear focus to make maters worse every bird that i looked at had a halo of red chromatic aberration around it 's head i have a pair of nikon 10x25s which out performed the bushnell 's hands down in terms of both clarity and sharpness i am returning the bushnell 's and considering the audubon equinox hp binoculars instead	1
0	i was able to use the canon ef 1 4x ii extender for some nature photography recently in wyoming i shot elk in low light conditions so i was shooting pretty much wide open the extender did not compromise the inherent sharpness of the lens at all you could see the hairs on the animals heads it 's fantastic	1
0	my bother in law and i went to africa on safari last year we had purchased the binoculars especially to use while hunting the optics were good and we were initially impressed by the image stabilization while still here in the states our impressions were confirmed when our professional hunters fell in love with them during the hunt they were so impressed by the is and price that we left a pair with our hunter he used them for the entire season last year and when he visited the states last month he reported that they are still doing well	1
0	this is a great product i wish i had not waited so long to purchase it you must be aware that it only works with l type batteries i though that it would work with p or m types which is what i have for 2 sony camcorders i had to then purchase an l battery \( np f970 \) my old camcorder that uses p batteries is able to charge l batteries as well do your homework with the batteries	1

1	i have an r717 camera i bought the dock too each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical hp labels both as an r07 battery but the l1812a has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera the other battery is the l1812b and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera i bought a clone battery \( not hp \) and its edges are rounded too maybe hp could explain the difference just thought you would like to know	1

0	wow okay so i was thinking this was a screen about the size of a smaller camera because i didnt read the dimensions before i bought it here on amazon so i was a little disappointed in the size this is about half the size of an ipod mini it is by no means big read the dimesions well before you purchase the photos are really good quality and clear just small lol	1
1	this case looks good and protects the camera adequately but is too bulky it has n't got a lot of room inside i was unable to fit an extra sd card in its little case and a spare battery the belt clip is difficult to use and i end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time there are better cases for this camera	1
0	the product was easy to use and accurate it is also a great buy	1
1	i purchased a 510 powershot in summer of 2005 after couple time of use the zoom on the cameras lens would n't work anymore i cound't take any picture anymore i contacted canon over this and they ask me to pay shiping to send the camera to them to fix	1

0	i wish there was also a photo that showed the backside of this camera case if there was i would have known that this excellent quality case unfortunately does not have a belt loop which is what i was looking for in this product great quality nevertheless	1
0	our firm uses our powershotsd500 camera daily and often takes long videos of our work for our clients and material processing long battery life is very important we have over a dozen of the canon batteries pleased with them all	1
1	mini dv cams are better and should cost about the same this particular camera has poor quality video and it is a pain to get video transferred to your computer the software is glitchy so you 'll probably end up downloading drivers yourself find a different camera	1
0	i highly recommend this super wide angle lens for anyone wanting to take landscape pictures buildings or lots of other stuff ! it is so different than the standard kit lens \( 18 55 \) you wo n't be sorry when you start learning all the possibilities of the extraordinary lens	1

0	i purchased this battery as a back up to the one that came with the camcorder the great thing about this is once charged it can sit in a camcorder for a month without loosing any power i discovered this last week when i wanted to use the camcorder and was worried that the battery may be dead by now but surprise surprise its recharge time is very fast the only negative part \( if i must have to give \) is it 's a little bigger then the one that comes with camcorder i say go for it	1
1	i received the lens adapter but there was no info on how to use it it screws in over the regular zoom lens but offers absolutely nothing to the use of the kodak dx6490 i suspect there are additional filters or other accessories that might make the adapter useful and hope to find out what they may be in the near future the lens adapter by itself does n't seem to add anything to the use of the camera without something else \? \? \? ben boykin las cruces nm 8801	1

1	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 my intent was to put him in the shade that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 tried new batteries tried bluffing even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500 600 yards my opinion is this product is not worth the postage anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product	1
0	the best buy in the marketplace it easily fits into my suitcase for travel the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is	1
0	this case is great for the quick day outings it is rugged and keeps the camera safe my wife can throw it in her purse and i do n't have to worry about it getting banged up and she does n't have to worry about it being too bulky everyone should have two batteries with any of the canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead	1
0	this filter is an excellent cost efficient way to protect your valuable lenses	1
0	nice and compact the tripod does n't really work as i expected i am using my own tripod overall is a nice little unit for the money	1
0	bought this tripod to use with my spotting scope for target shooting easy attachment to my scope and multiple adjustment heights with the crank make it easy to zero in on the target and allow anyone to see thru the scope no matter how tall they are compact and lite to carry makes it easy to transport to and from the range	1
0	i use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work when you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with unless you are going for a very shadowy high contrast image this diffuser can save the day it is very light weight and easy to pack in small places so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
1	i agree with reviewer steve anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless the paper works says the may focus down to 35' maybe some will but not certainly not my pair i am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard and no the rubber eye caps absolutely will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses \( like me \) scot	1

0	i love the new digital canon the only problem is it 's not nearly as tough as it 's film twin i had the camera less than a month when the pop up flash quit working the canon people have been great and very helpful but i 'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory the photos however are wonderful film quality for the most part printable and enlargable \( it would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but i hike with it so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos	1
0	i took this case with me to my trip to new zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing if i did n't have this case i would have missed out on amazing shots it 's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well i loved it so much i actually bought one for my sister as well it is a great investment for anyone that does n't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	1

1	i was looking for a pair of roof prism binoculars like this for hawk and bird watching i had looked at swarovskis but they were way out of my budget nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution these binoculars are crystal clear with sharp focus the 42mm lens lets in lots of light lots more than the 35 's i 've been using i wear glasses and the twist up and down eyecups are a blessing there are also attached lens protectors for the 42mm nice because i always used to lose them for the price these ca n't be beat	1
0	great little camera case has a main pocket for the camera and a second smaller pocket to hold batteries and memory stick it 's well made ballistic nylon very durable attaches to belt or sholder strap	1
1	i just got this camera a week ago and thought it was great but today i tried to turn it on and it 's completely dead ! i even changed out the batteries and it 's still completely dead this is the first digital camera i 've had and i bought it because i'm going to europe \( two days after it died \) now i have to scramble to get a replacement before i take off grrrrr ! !	1
0	make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of l series lenses are compatible if you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition the af only works with lenses f 4 and faster on most camera bodies you do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body but the extra reach is really nice	1
1	this bag could be a bit larger and have more pockets quite small for the price just paying for the name on the bag	1

1	i got to get it off my chest this camera takes great photos and they print out wonderful but the camera has several down sides 1 as all have said it eats batteries big time this is a pain 2 it recharges slow between flash and between non flash forget about catching a great spontaneous moment 3 not durable i dropped mine out of the case from below waist hight and it does nto work at all i am sure by the time i send it in and pay for shipping and repair i can buy a new one that is cheaper and more reliable any suggestions \? \? \?	1

1	i received this filter and it had been used seals were open and case that holds filters cracked piece of plastic floating loose inside smug marks on it i was shocked i order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this	1
1	me and my wife bought the jvc camcorder and burner set up to send dvd 's back to my parents because we did not have an computer at the time at first it worked great then after 2 3 disc in it would pull up the same message unable to formate the disc we have been throught about 25 disc just to burn off 10 we returned it to get another and it did the same thing we thought i might of been a bad batch of disc so we used the one that came with the burner and no deal i do not recommend this to anyone	1
0	the enclosure has a solid feel to it i dove with it three times with no problem at all it would be nice if the weight does not cost extra the only compliant i have is that the enclosure is a tight fit so it is very difficult to fit a desiccant into the enclosure	1
0	very clear pictures very happy with this camera note that it has only the lcd screen and no viewfinder but this has n't been a problem for me as it 's pretty easy to use	1
1	i agree with the many other users who have experienced the condensation operation paused defect on their jvc gr xxxx despite numerous others reporting this problem jvc says its not a recognized problem i would disagree it is a recognized problem but its your problem not theirs	1
1	when it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50 of the time if i was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher it seemed to become less effective each time i used it to the point that now i'm lucky to get a reading 10 of the time it still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless	1
1	i found a case that 's almost exactly like this one except it 's 10 cheaper it 's made by samsonite model tm90blu \( there is also a black case \) but like i said exact same thing unless you care about your camera case saying lumix save yourself some dough and get the one from wal mart	1
0	after much research i finally found the binoculars that fit my every need the price was right the delivery was right on schedule and the product is excellent	1
1	i do n't know what case others got some have said too tight but mine was very loose the camera is swimming around in the case easily half a centimeter of clearance not recommended just buy the battery and wait for someone to make a good aftermarket case	1
0	i fried my charger in mexico and needed to replace it this was the exact replica and it works great	1
1	the magnetic clasp is weak very weak making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it 's own i keep this camera case inside of my purse i would n't recommend this productthere has to be something better	1
1	my hunting buddy purchased a nikon 800 my intent was to put him in the shade that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro 1000 tried new batteries tried bluffing even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500 600 yards my opinion is this product is not worth the postage anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product	1
0	took the camera bag on vacation and it came in very handy i carried both my camcorder and my regular camera in the bag it has plenty of pockets for storage and the main space inside is flexible \( has a divider you can place where ever you want \) so you can secure cameras however you wish	1
0	the picture and dimensions are incorrect it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue the correct dimensions are 2 9 x4 2 x1 8 \( wxhxd \) it also fits the fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it for amazon has a different case built specifically for the v10 but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture i am keeping this one it is a perfect fit	1
0	have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting at sporting events \( indoor and outdoor \) and at concerts fast focusing and great image stabilization \( is does use quite a bit more power though \) have not had one problem with it solid build and has a little heft to it it is a bit pricey but i chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens	1
0	i purchase this on december 2006 i have other 10x50 binocular but when i look at sky through this binox it 's amazing ! ! ! i recommend it for astronomy and birding trip	1
1	poor and slow focus and flash thought nikon had a good name wrongif you like this camera it must be you first digital	1
1	i wear glasses and press against the viewfinder as hard as i can to help keep the shot stable \( i shoot birds at 700mm \) the first thing my friend and i did was to compare two identical lenses cameras etc one with one without the extender result the image appeared the same size and the extender slightly blurred the image in other words completely useless	1
1	i bought this frame as a gift for my parents and ended up returning it the price was right but the quality was poor and there were 2 spots on the screen that looked like they were already burned out \( displaying blue and green pixels \) i did enjoy the fact that it hooks right up to the computer with a usb port but that is about all overall do n't waste your time and money	1
1	the battery lasts for about 10 minutes even with a full charge i made the mistake of buying two of them for my husband 's dvd player and they were useless what a waste of my money	1
0	the lenes work on the factory lens only with no feature to add additional lens it works as advertized i would have like to add the wide tell lens to the filter for better out door videoing	1
1	i had a kodak camera for years that i absolutely loved we took it ice skating and ended up falling on it therefore my family bought me this sony for my b day and i have to say this is the worst camera i have ever owned if you have any movement \( such as action shots or small children \) the picture always comes out blurry what a pain ! also the picture quality is horrible i will not purchase a sony again and am going back to a kodak	1
1	this item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter it produces flare in the picture furthermore after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9 light loss vs multi coated filters like hoya s hmc or b w mrc filters as for polarizer effect itself i think it 's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day \( the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	1
0	this small and cheep hood can save you realy a lot of money it 's doeing it job wonderful keeps you pictures brigth and clear but also the hood protect you lens from a lot of things which trying to hit you lens	1
0	pros reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall better to break the hood than the front element makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you cons will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile	1
0	i like that the protection filter is threaded so you can screw a conversion lens right over it rather than having to use one or the other	1
0	goo	1
1	it looks great genuine leather much better than synthetic like a brand named leather wallet but there is no where you can tie the case to the camera hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos there is no where to put the essential accessories \( battery and another memory stick \) there is no way to clip to the belt will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	1
0	i did n't have a ton of time to research this flash i 've used it now on several occasions with my canon 5d and could n't be happier with it it 's great for shooting portraits i can shoot 10 shots in a row and the flash keeps up i would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser get 's rid of the typical flash harsh light	1
0	i had 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense for me to pick up this digital camera and attach my old lenses while i had owned other digitals i keep going back to my old rebel until now we got the back up battery pack my husband and i love it	1
1	i returned this item i have not received notice that they did receive it back so i will have to wait and see if my credit card account is credited	1
1	i bought this harness because of the connecting straps from the harness to the binoculars i have compact binoculars and wanted the extention straps for a better fit the set i received did not have the extention straps included the harness was the same as all the other harnesses i could buy locally for much less money with the only difference being the name on the back if you are buying these because of the extention straps you should email the seller first to make sure the straps are included before spending the extra dollars they were well made just not the same item as shown in the picture	1
1	the camera worked fine however after six months it stopped working i took it to a pentax authorized repairer and pentax refused to pay for the camera because the was dirt and grit in the zoom mechanism my use was in no way abusive i had a previous canon powershot s200 that lasted forever with the same usage until i gave it away i guess i should have stayed with canon i bought the pentax for its size and lightweight but what good is that if it does n't last ! do n't get the pentax and expect long term use out of it	1
1	the case does not fit and the battery is incorrect forthe dx759	1
0	excellent ! they have a really long life and are the perfect backup for your rechargeables	1
0	excellent product for the price pictures are not that good but you ca n't ask more for this price	1
0	very nice bag and well made however i bought it for the canon dc100 dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment \( cords and charger \)	1
0	i bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens at 80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars the quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
0	the only two drawbacks to this lens are that it requires a huge amount of light to take quality photographs and it is relatively slow to autofocus especially where there is not adequate light aside from this it is a good but not great lens it is probably worth the money that it cost however i believe that a better lens would be the 70 300 mm vr which costs about 4x the price of this lens	1
1	the power cord that accompanies this charger is bulkier than the charger itself you would n't get that from the picture too bad other manufacturers have learned to incorpaorate the plugging mechanism directly into the charger	1
1	1 year old 3 e18 errors 2 battery erros shipped back for service 4 times ! search the net for e18 before you buy !	1
1	this item does not charge your camera it does provide power to your camera while plugged in but it does not recharge your camera 's battery	1
0	not too hard and not too soft camera fits nicely with compartments for just about anything you need for your camera	1
0	we just got this camera after much research the camera is easy to use and we like it but frustrated that it does n't do some of what was advertised for the most part tho for the price and all it is fine just read all the directions and do n't be to disappointed if it does n't play your old 8 mm tapes and a few other things like that i wrote to sony and they said that this model does n't do a few things so main point here is read and read and know what it is i liked the service we received thru amazon no problems ther	1
1	i bought this lens and was pretty excited about it but i 've been disappointed previous to this i bought the 50mm 1 8 for 70 and that lens completely puts this one to shame i need a wider angle lens and went for this one but all too often found myself quite disappointed with the results edges of subjects were all messy and just looked terrible even at higher f stops i shoot with a 20d the usm is awesome though and will for sure be an option in whatever lens i choose to buy in place of this one the focal range of 28 105 was also very nice but to me the picture quality was not so good	1
1	just turned out ot be more complicated to set up than i wanted never used returned it	1
0	this lens does ok at magnifying about 2x max on full zoom the magnification was not as sharp as without the close up lens	1
1	it fits in the s1 but it does n't always charge the contacts arent the same size as the oem version when it does n't charge i just re insert the batter and it works but its sort of a bummer	1
1	this camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures i bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it \( she 's happy with anything pink \) i was very disappointed at the quality and functionality	1
1	this camera is garbage it was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money it was hard to figure out it took lousy pictures it burned through batteries avoid this camera i just wish i could give it zero stars	1
1	i bought it for my 18 55 ef s and it looks like it is not very efficient but i guess it is normal for a 18mm \( x 1 6 \) i would have prefered a tulip design like those of sigma	1
1	i purchase this instrument twice the first time there were black specks in the lense so it was returned the second time was worst i e same black specs but the thing did n't work at all i have also checked this manufacturer 's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense this is n't a quality optical product	1
0	i 've had other 3 digital cameras and this is the best i think i shots very quick flash is brighty and even soft flash for more natural shots can browse pictures very fast and is has a lot of posibilities to edit inside the camera is light tiny and slim one of the best cameras i do n't find a negative feature on it i love it	1
1	this needs a lot of light i returned this do due the lighting picture quality the one nice thing about it is you can record decent video quality on a memory card mpeg 4	1
1	if you want to load directly from your camera 's memory card the system takes forever to copy photos to the internal card there is no copy all function loading information from a computer did n't work the usb connection was not recognized by windows xp and i could n't find any drivers on the web a setup cd would be a nice addition btw the screen was not as large as one might think it is very wide but not tall and it crops the top bottom of most pictures making it great for shots of the grand canyon but not for portraits of people	1
0	has any one tried the compatible battery from power101 \? i ca n't believe the price i am struggling btwn buying the sony brandbattery and the compatible ones	1
1	poor quality unit worked sometimes sometimes not gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out	1
1	very slow storage even with a fast card small but too thick for comfortable handling i ended up selling it on ebay and buying a canon sd600 which is a great camera thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time i 've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures do n't buy the nikon without first checking out the canon sd600	1
0	very speedy delivery a gift for my daughter she loves it i thought we were to receive a free photo card but did not not really necessary did not know that still playing with it and having a blast i do like that it is weather resistant	1
0	i am impressed with the quality of photos with this camera occaisionally when i turn it on the lense doies n't slide out which is a little disconcerting however if i tap it or turn it off and turn it o n again it comes out to the operational position i enjoy using it amd would n't hesitate to purchase another one	1
0	i was a little skeptical on this product because of the cheap price and the lack of reviews but it is just what it says it is and i am really happy with my purchase i would definitely buy this again	1
1	i recently ordered a kodak camera from amazon com with that i also ordered this battery the camera bag everything was delivered as expected except the camera over 2 weeks later i was notified the camera is not available now i'm stuck with a battery camera bag that i ca n't return because they came from another seller the camera i bought from a different seller came with the bag uses a different battery now i'm out the cost of the battery the bag the shipping charges ! thanks a lot	1
1	for nearly 100 this adaptor provides very little \( 1 5x \) magnification it is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly this is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor which is used infrequently by me but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance it is lightweight but cumbersome and does n't accept filters for real telephoto capabilities get an slr with interchangeable lenses i sent this product back	1
0	i do n't have that much stuff but fits all my dslr gadgets plus my camcorder fits my canon xti with my canon 50 mm attached my kit lens my new canon 70 300 is my panasonic video cam minor accessories \( extra batteries cables memory cards etc \) there are separators with velcros inside so you can configure the bag however you want it the only issue i have with this bag is that i wa n't able to configure it to store my xti with my 70 300 attached	1

0	the bushnell powerview 12x25 is a fine small pocket sized binocular since my wife is an avid bird watcher we already have several binoculars of various sizes and viewing power our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell that we used for trips so i researched then bought this one from amazon for her birthday she loves it the viewing power is a bit greater than the other and is every bit as compact which makes it easy to pack for vacations yet provides for a good viewing experience when enjoying the various bird populations around the country we both highly recommend this and other bushnell products	1
0	is an product of great quality is a kit complete kit of accessories for hp 435i digital camera	1

1	my frame freezes after displaying a few pictures the remote does n't work there is no website for contact or support	1
0	pros compact and complete this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it 's reversible backdrop \( gray blue \) i also have used the black back panel for some shots as well construction quality is good \( i found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel which is fabric and held in place with velcro tabs \) sturdy enough for its intended purpose i like the output of the lights seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight cons only one complaint the output of the lights could be stronger requires a tripod to gain depth of field with a smaller aperture	1
1	i purchased this for my 4 year old son because he loves to take pictures i did n't want to spend a lot of money however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working however when it did work every single picture was blurry there is only one button for every option and it is very confusing i would n't recommend this product to anyone it is being returned	1
0	this is a great camera it 's so thin and takes amazing pictures even when the subject is moving the best shot option makes taking pictures under any kind of lighting great quality i suggest this to anyone	1
0	i am very satisfied with this purchase it is exactly what i wanted i purchased 5 more as business gifts for important clients	1

0	i just bought this for about 190 at the local px i am impressed so far i was going to buy the gs180 but for the sale price i would be crazy to pass this up so far the low light is much better than a single ccd the video playback is quiet compared to a few other camcorders that record the motor noise onto the tape i plan on buying an extended battery and a tripod today at the same sale i will use this camcorder mostly for home videos of my son and vacations we take around europe i look froward to using this camcorder a lot	1
0	i bought this for my mother in law who is in her 80s and set it up for her it 's quite easy if you 're already computer literate and the controls are very user friendly as well the software could use a few tweaks to make it not look so basic but for someone like my mother in law it works well wish i had a docking station for my nikon	1
0	out of the box this is a simple to use camera the convenience of having the video or picture right on a hard drive is great i did a lot of searching and this one was the most bang for the buck just starting to use it so ca n't say much for now my wife loved it for its size and weight	1
0	for the price and quality i rated this lenses with 5 stars if you really want to see how good this lens are see the photos i took in europe i too around 5000 photos i posted a few on the web \( see link below \) for the price i recommend this lens as walk around lens the zoom is pretty usefull they are very realiable and \( almost \) very sharp get this lens instead of the kit lens \( 18 55 mm \) until you are ready to spend more here are some of my pictures taken in europe with this lens \( images have been compressed \) http www laplazita net europa	1
1	the picture quality is okay but the battery life is horrible	1
1	doesnt work even though the lenmar website says it does i thought it was a pretty good deal for 26 i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work	1
1	i bought this camera for my wife and we find it unusable the problem is the flash recovery time which takes a good 5 seconds during this time the camera 's view finder goes black and you cannot use it because the camera is so slow we have missed many important pictures of our children consequently we found that for any important family events this is not the camera we use i own nikon 35mm slr cameras and i am shocked that nikon would sell this unusable product if it is your life your recording i recommend that you buy a different camera	1
1	this canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out on a 1080p monitor i have used other hdv format cameras and they were much better the low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain if you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light but still plauged in low light	1
0	i have used this charger battery package for a while now in my digital slr battery performance is excellent ! the downside is that the charger has issues the top bay charges faster than the bottom bay and the batteries get very hot when charging it has not seemed to affect the batteries in the year i have had them if you are looking for exceptional batteries buy these and the charger is okay just beware that it does not charge all nimh batteries but does do most	1
1	i bought this lens in may for my brand new rebel xt i used it on a vacation mainly and am pretty dissapointed i'm no pro or even skilled amateur but i do know the lens is not giving me quality shots the autofocusing is slow and af or manual shots are n't very sharp at any zoom there seems to be a fingerprint on one of the inner lenses that indicates poor quality control to me i wanted a good all around lens before building a real lens collection of different types i guess this would fit the bill if it took sharp pictures i would n't pay more than 150 for this lens again	1
0	these cameras are as simple to use as any i have ever seen and the quality of the pictures are as good or better than cameras costing 3 times as much great buy	1
1	well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version wrong ! i just received mine today and it 's got the international warranty card and users manual i have n't decided if i'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey market version of this unit	1
1	this case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses briefcases or luggage but do n't count on it to protect your camera from falls dirt or dust it looks good the powershot logo gives an authentic look to it	1
0	if you take lots of photos rechargeable batteries are the way to go carry the other charged batteries with you in case you need to swap them out	1
0	this replacement battery is half the cost of canon 's yet offers longer life i bought it when i first got my sd10 when one battery runs out the spare goes in the lenmar still works great while the canon is near end life ! i am buying two more since they are so cheap ! do not buy no name batteries on ebay they do not last worth a darn and are basically a waste of money ! do n't do it	1
0	for the price you get a lot out of this camera 6x zoom stabilized the images comes out great at full zoom \( 2 stabilization mode \) the aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture the multiple program modes just about lets you take a great picture under different situation ! controls are easy to use and get to in all definitely a great buy for the price the down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the dmc lz5 or a camcorder	1
0	photos printed are very sharp some difficulty with printer cartidge and as expensive as they are you ca n't afford to have much difficulty good for craft times with the kids	1
1	return \? ha ha ! ! ! you must email them for permission they do n't provide the email address i have spent untold hours trying to get them to respond they will do everything to avoid returns and amazon just looks the other way do n't do it !	1

0	do n't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras \( ie the 20d 30d rebels etc \) the canon l lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception i have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already great lens great color so well built super sharp just watch out if this is your first l lens you 'll be hooked this is a lens you will have for many years great investment	1

1	the plastic stand that holds the frame upright broke immediately also be sure to note that there is no memory card spend the extra money and buy something better i wish i had	1
1	the quality of the pictures are nice when they will actually print unless you use the printer with your camera on the dock it is incredibly hard to get the darn thing to work if you decide to crop the picture on your pc and then want to print it be prepared to invest time in getting the darn thing to work ! i have had it for sometime now and i have never been more irritated than when it comes time to print pictures on this thing	1
0	the battery is great but amazon offers the accessory kit with the same battery plus a mini dv tape and a carrying case for the same price the case is useless for the zr series but might come in handy for some other purpose	1
1	i would agree with the other review the indoor low light quality of the video is unacceptable i will be returning the camcorder today to purchase another	1
0	it was everything it advertised as being i can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras being a slingshot backpack my back does n't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags i like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack	1

0	i 've had my d2h for 9 months now i 've heard of the magenta skin tones issue but have never seen it skin tones on my unit are great it seems this issue plagued a minority of users camera is very fast exposes well and delivers results it 's primarily designed to be a sports and photojournalism camera for situations where speed counts it 's a 4 megapixel wonder it 's true it only has 4 megapixels but they are 4 great megapixels images upsize wonderfully i love my unit and am debating whether to buy a second one as a backup or wait for the d2x the price of the d2x is making that decision a bit easier and i'm leaning toward another d2h	1
0	for the price paid this is a great camera should last me for a long time debated buying a slr but this seems to have all the features of an expensive slr \( actually it is a slr just no interchangable lenses \) and a lot easier to use	1

1	the camera worked perfectly for one week and then stopped working permanently i just sent it off for repairs and have not received a diagnosis as to the root of the problem	1
1	in my experience this camera takes great pictures but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate	1
1	panasonic offers a usb driver however no video driver this means that anyone using windows xp will be unable to transfer video to their computer when talking to panasonic they just said they didnt have a driver and were not developing one they offered no suggestions or alternatives	1
1	it seems as if every time i want to use the camera the battery is dead i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day i should expect very much i'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes but i should n't have to do so	1
1	use less than 3 times the touch screen does n't work do n't know why	1

1	the idea is wonderful but the window is too small to be useful i have it have pictures on it but never show it to anyone trying to find the right light to illuminate a tiny picture was ridiculous easier to show a few pictures in my wallet	1
0	hi have a rebel extreme and needed to use the high speed mode but the flash could n't even vaguely keep up i was taking pictures of dancers so needed a flash system that could keep up the speedlite really does this perfectly i'm able to take a rapid fire sequence of photos and this flash system is there each time i do n't know if it really helps when taking a single photo but if you want a flash that can keep up this one is great ! i like it so much i'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot to run in slave mode with this one	1
0	wow is all there is to say no problems with it perfect for a casual picture take	1
0	i upgraded from the canon digital rebel \( grey body \) to this because i was ready to take my photography to a new level one thing i like most about this camera is it 's flash compenstation i purchased the 430ex flash with it because i was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1

0	celestron 's tool is easy to carry easy to use and \( at least in my case ! \) gives me quick precision collimation with my newtonian why pay for a laser collimator \( which needs to be calibrated \) when you can use this \? collimation is the most important part of your setup without good mirror alignment all you 'll see are blobs and blurs even on the best viewing nights this combination tool makes aligning both primary and secondary mirrors fairly painless and also fairly fast highly recommended for any level of observer	1
1	it 's unfortunate that one of the best lens bargains out there is followed up by one of the worst photo ripoffs this hood how can you pay 75 for a great prime lens and 25 for a flimsy piece of plastic to cover it	1
0	this film has great color production and performance the price is also just right you ca n't go wrong with the fujifilm superia x tra 400	1
1	wow now if you really want to see a rip off here it is not to be damaging to amazon com but hey for the 50mm just get some carboard and tape it to the front to shield it from the sun the hood is definitely not worth it	1
0	i gave this as an xmas gift to my 14 yr old daughter and she loves it super easy to use good idea to get a backup battery if you 're like her and forget to charge it sometimes big selling bonus was that it was thin enough to fit into her pocket	1
0	i got this camera for my birthday present in january and i'm extremely satisfied i'm very new to the entire photography world however this camera makes it easy to get into the camera is smaller than i expected however it takes great pictures i use it often for pictures while we are on trips the picture quality is great however screen quality is n't up to par with other brands this is a great value and i really like it my only complaint is that the easyshare software is bad it 's slow outdated and does n't work well overall i recommend getting a 1 gb sd card i have 3 of them	1
1	i was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first i had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls i located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till i could get there to try it out firstly the bag is nice but does n't hold as much as i thought it still could have worked for my but for one thing this bag is not designed for those with a er womanly build it was the most uncomfortable bag i have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me so glad i was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online just a word of warning to the ladies	1
1	they sent me wrong lens cover and said i ordered the wrong one do n't think so since i got copy poor customer service all around	1

0	i'm new to the digital slr world i had been using the built in flash on my rebel xt the built in flash had done alright but was nothing to write home about since i had spent most of my money on the camera i needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done this flash met both requirements if you are an advance user you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features yet if you a newbie like me this flash is great ! it has improved my picture quality dramaticly	1
0	for those wishing to purchase this product and who also want accessory filters to protect the lens or to add special effects although not mentioned the size of the filter is 30mm \( not the 37 mm mentioned at other locations which caused me to order the wrong size which now must be returned \) remember 30 \( thirty \) mm	1
0	awesome compact camera that takes remarkably sharp pics very easy to use touchscreen and \( my favorite \) reliable stabilization feature	1
0	unlike many reviewers i am not diver i bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera would n't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park pool and beach this equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash this case has out lived an s400 and s500 well worth the 170 price tag	1
0	i owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f 2 8 version overall i was very happy with the f 4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses and the f 4 can provide plenty of background blur if you are shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend the f 4	1

1	i bougt this camera because i had had a sony coolpix 3 which took great pictures with this camera you can never get it adjusted right if you use the flash the pictures are to light if you dont they are too dark it is a constant battle with this little cute camera worse camera purchase i ever made	1

1	there is currently a known issue with many of the sony camcorders this is being called the black screen of death what happens is that the camera works great for 1 2 years then the ccd goes out like a light the camera will not take video again sony is evasive if not downright deceitful about this issue when you call tech support the fact is sony does not stand behind their product if this happens to you sony will not own the defect and you will be out hundreds of dollars there is a lengthy thread on cnet on this issue search for sony black screen wishing you luck in the purchase of your \( not sony \) video camera scot	1

1	tried this as a possible improvement over using aa nihm batteries in my olympus d 524 camera turned out to be a downgrade did not stay charged as long as my panasonic 1950 mah aa batts it would die a sudden death no low battery warnings before the camera shut down i have gone back to the dependability and predictability of the aa nihm batts the cr v3 now gathers dust it did not even improve the flash recycle time just a waste	1
1	have never before provided a negative review but this is a product to avoid instructions worthless only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and error after getting best possible settings main problem is still picture quality using high quality jpg files as input photos display with about the visual sharpness of the sunday funnies individual dots very noticeable even at some distance not at all like what i have seen in other digital picture frames just arrived from amazon and intended as a v day gift \( tomorrow \) for my wife big disappointment guess i better make a dash to the florist	1
0	this cable came in a cheap packing and it does not have any logo on it so you ca n't say which company it belongs to i have used a lot of sony products and i feel it is not up to the standard of sony it works great had no problems so far it is flexible kinds so you do n't have to worry about positioning your laptop according to your tv	1
1	i purchased this camera for a friend to use in hawaii we had nothing but problems getting it to wind properly and the pictures both on land and underwater were all blurred and my friend was very unhappy and i was frustrated i do not know if this is just a bad camera or what	1
0	multi element add on lense used with kodak dx 7590 provides good wide angle capability note that this is a very large add on lense \( screws into dx 7590 extension piece which costs an additional 20 \) does the job well in most portraiture and scenic applications however two caveats \( 1 \) slight curvature of field in extreme corners of wide angle shots \( ie corners of shots may be noticeably out of focus \) suggest cropping to 95 of original picture to maintain sharpness across plane \( 2 \) size of lense will render pop up flash and outside the lense focusing system \( ultra sonic \) less functional	1
0	it works as specified on my sony hdr hc3 hd camcorder i have used it several times and cant find any noticeable blurs distortions using this lens its a little pricey but well worth the money	1

1	what a pile of junk three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture if you move at all during that three seconds the picture is a blurred mess even if you do n't move the pictures turn out blurry and dark and if you use the flash you get a lovely white picture of nothing i ca n't believe they sell this thing	1
0	i have been shooting away for the last few weeks the olympus 720 is a gem i must have filled up my card 3 4 times so far being new to the digital camera era i am finding that it is not as hard as i thought it would be shoot pop the card into the card reader copy to computer upload to walmart 's photo service and i have my prints mailed to my house in a few days i am happy that everything was included with the kit i would have never known what i needed and it basically has everything covered	1
1	i have owned numerous celestron telescopes up to 11 inch apertures so i expected better i ordered this for my daughter it arrived defective the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket making collimation impossible in celestron 's defense it likely happened in transit amazon 's return policy is not a hassle and i'm upgrading her to another telescope i'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	1
1	this battery only gives me about an hour of playing time on my philips pet724 7 portable dvd divx player after that it claims to have 75 charge left but ca n't even get the player to turn on and does n't charge it if it 's turned off	1

1	i have owned the s410 camera for almost two years when on new years eve i pulled out my handy camera from the padded case it 's always in and to my horror the e18 error message appeared ! it has n't worked since i paid 400 for this camera and canon would like 110 \( plus taxes \) to fix the problem ridiculous especially since this seems to be a very common problem with their cameras i 've enjoyed the camera 's picture quality and ease of use but what a waste to spend that much money to take pictures with it for just under two years ! beware of this flaw that canon does n't seem to acknowledge	1
0	this is something you will really need to keep you camcorder save and sound defenitely worth the money	1
0	i bought this together with the sony alpha \( very good deal from amazon \) the lens is a great complement to the kit lens or the identical but older km 18 70 images are very sharp and the lens is built very well great for wildlife imaging the other reviewers are right the af is n't too good at the long end of this lens but overall a great camera the end of the lens does rotate while zooming it may not be good for some filters	1
0	got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well ! more than 3000 great pictures have been taken the camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance a word of caution ensure that the camera does n't get pressurized laterally this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it the spring operated shutter is very sensitive would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a cost effective and easy to use film camera	1

0	the scent of this tea brewing is a real wake me up cinnamon nutmeg allspice and orange peel are some of the very redolant flavors the cinnamon is so strong that it gives a slight burning feeling in the mouth one of my favorite things about this tea i'm not a huge tea drinker but i really enjoy this in winter it 's great for mulling things as well apples pears and wine my only complaint is that it is not 100 reliant on chopped ingredients and there are some flavors added but it 's still incredibly good and nice for a thoughtful morning or evening makes me miss seattle wa and pike place market	2
0	the taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me mens is the name perhaps because the 2 individual packs are so big when i first saw that i wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia nope these are for everyone it is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate i cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time share this with some friends would be fun to have these for a party	2

0	teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that this is a moderately price matcha tea so do n't except the best flavor it is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks desserts broth etc real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet if you do n't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice	2

0	as a classic seattle tea this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea when i drink this tea i am home again this tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of seattle in one cup this is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least 5 minutes to bring out all the flavors you can sweeten this more if you like with stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness it is good with a touch of muscovado sugar from india tree or the rieme french vanilla syrup when i'm writing reviews and i get sleepy this teawakes me up the rebecca review	2
1	but just add a little spenda and cream and it is mmm mmm good i can actually feel a slight boost of energy and think more clearly on the days that i drink this tea also i have n't had the slightest inkling of a cold or flu this year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and i have been exposed to all of it but knock on wood i 've been the healthiest one in the family and at work \( and the only one drinking this stuff \) so go figure \? there are too many things good about this tea to not try it	2

0	this food calls back to my youth i'm still always impressed that these things can stay as moist as they do this is a major plus i'm really not so keen on the whole frosting thing and this one still finds me wanting with the urge to be sick just thinking about eating the filling but more power to them for having the retro cool thing going on and the ability to foist them off on adult aquaintences in need of a snack	2

0	you can get better tea if you 're willing to deal with leaves but that 's not practical for most of us especially for those who drink it at work like i do compare this to a budget brand bagged green tea \( like salada which i used to drink \) and you 'll be able to tell the difference right away the tazo is n't overbearingly flavorful \( no green tea is \) but its subtle green taste is addictive \( as is the caffeine ! \)	2

0	this is by far the most enjoyable hot chocolate i 've ever come across for consumer purchase it is high in calories and expensive but if you are looking for a rich comforting cup of chocolate this is it this hot chocolate is thick and delicious in the european sense yet not overly sweet as many american brands are unfortunately mariebelle is neither organic nor fair trade but if that is not important to you then there is no downside i 've found no other maker produces a finer cup of chocolate save the city bakery in nyc which is the next best thing to parisian hot chocolate	2

0	yes the coffee is the best quality pesticide free there are technical issues with the pods 1 pod was broken when i opened up the pouch it was stored in for any pods to arrive broken when they are so expensive is just not acceptable also many times the pod is not working but turning it around and pressing down on it with a fork or a spoon makes it work \( i have black decker home cafe machine \) great coffee but i felt that i had to really work for it i also feel that to charage 15 to ship a box of coffee pods is a bit excessive considering that they are being shiped from la not hi	2

0	tasty bite punjab eggplant is delicious and spicy try adding a bit of plain yogurt serve with rice or bread \( nan or pita work well \) and you have a brilliant meal that costs only a few dollars this is true of all of the tasty bite indian entrees i wish the tasty bite thai meals came as entrees \( i e without the rice or noodles \) so i could streach them out into a big meal by adding my own rice or noodles tasty bite entrees are really easy to keep on hand since they do n't have to be refrigerated buying in bulk works well for these	2
0	my husband a non celiac eat this pancake mix \( to make waffles \) all the time the recipe calls for egg whites to be beaten until stiff so it is a bit more work than many other mixes but it is worth it ! the result tastes like real waffles kinnikinnick mix also makes good tasting waffles but the texture is n't as nice	2

0	i 've been a fan of dave 's sauces for quite awhile now and this product is no exception the initial bite into one of these olives is relatively painless and then the fun begins a slow burning sensation begins to take over until your mouth is wondering what did i just do \? want some more fun \? offer some to friends and then stand back to watch the excitement while not as heat intensive as his insanity sauces ranking only half way up his thermometer scale it 's still got a little bit of punch to it with it 's five different peppers who would 've though olives could be this much fun	2

0	nicely seasoned creamy texture served over rice one packet makes a generous meal for one or would serve two with something on the side cooked simply by boiling the packet in a pot of water until hot one of relatively few prepared food options where the microwave directions actually require more cleanup than the stovetop option makes a good option for backpacking too assuming the weight is acceptable requires no refrigeration and edible out of the packet with a spoon cold if necessary	2

1	the prime rib slices i had were pre cooked and they are terrible nothing like what you would expect from a good restaurant or make at home they lack in both flavor and texture the remaining slices i have will probably be sliced up and used in tacos	2
0	this matcha green tea powder is delicious ! it does come slightly pre sweetened so people who do not wish to consume any sugar may need to be aware also sometimes the package has mo cha on the label which is 'chinese' for green tea \( exactly the same as matcha green tea \) i used this powder to make a green tea smoothie frappe and it tasted great highly recommend	2
0	i was a bit skeptical when i purchased what is a hybrid product sprouts and curry humph actually surprisingly good and filling for those on the job tasty bite is solid choice for microwave fast food and this vegan treat works better in fact than many of their more traditional offerings	2

0	first of all wow instant noodles for sale on amazon \? second excellent decision on selling nongshim 's shin ramen nongshim is the market leader in korean instant noodles which are epitomized by shin ramen 's trademark spicyness and deliciosity not as filling as the non cup version \( which you have to cook over a stove \) this small guy does pack a punch and will keep you satisfied for three hours until you get hungry for more shin ramen is second only to sutah ramen in my opinion	2

0	i'm only a little bit of a coffee nut but i really like this coffee my fiance 's father brought some back from costa rica while he was there on business i have just finished my bag and already miss it this was one of the best coffees i have tasted well balanced not too acidic not too bitter just right in my opinion it 's really good served traditionally hot but it 's also great iced and as with all coffees it 's best if you get whole bean and grind it yourself my opinion a must try	2

0	i love lindt lindor chocolate truffles i fell in love with the milk chocolate and since i am such a big white chocolate fan as well i had to try this one its divine i will give it that but it tasted more like vanilla frosting than white chocolate it felt like i was eating some sort of vanilla cake frosting out of a can than white chocolate so i was dissapointed that aspect but it really is a great item despite that	2
0	wonderful service and product ! best price for freeze dried strawberries that i 've found there was some powder but i 've always noted this with freeze dried strawberries i did n't think it was excessive and i think it 's great added to the graham cracker crust for cheescake	2

0	these beans were really fresh and lower cost than other suppliers the beans were shipped free and promptly	2
1	i could n't believe the price for these berries and they 're a third of the size they should be i 'll stick to buying mine from the local asian foods grocery at 3 25 a pound	2
0	i was actually anxiously waiting to try these since the reviews were mixed but i am soooooo glad i did try them bec now i am hooked ! ! ! ! yes they are a bit expensive when compared to pasta but i think of it as paying some extra bucks to remove some pounds off ! i make sure i rinse them really well in cold water right before i boil them for around 5 minutes which removes all the bad smell ! i just add some marinara sauce and it is a done deal ! i found the texture to be actually good like a firmer version of the ramen noodles ! i think these make an excellent snack or meal !	2

0	the vanilla beans arrived still moist and plump they 're so much better in appearance than the kinds you can buy at whole foods or wild oats which are very dry and shriveled by comparison not to mention overpriced the fragrance is overpowering and the shipment comes with a nice recipe for creme brulee do n't throw away your used vanilla pods ! save them to flavor your sugar	2

0	this chocolate was great the first time i used a fondue fountain i used chocolate chips i had no idea you have to melt it beforehand in a pot then add oil to it in order to use it i ended up adding too much oil and ruined the whole thing then someone told me about using liquid chocolate it was so much easier you just have to pour it in and the taste was amazing if i didnt find this i probably would never have used my fountain again	2

0	if one has to be on a restricted diet and finds a company or in this case a bakery that supplies treats to those who can not eat regular sweets this wonderful bakery is the answer their bagels danishes and doughnut are very good yes they are smaller than the usual portions but the quality is a they have packed their danishes in regular cake pastry boxes and their doughnuts in plastic form cases to protect the doughnuts the service is excellent they ship on monday through wednesday with two day shipping i am a regular customer especially for their hearty low carb bagels	2

1	these steaks dribble like a basketball and shoot like a dream they should include a backboard rim and net with these and some cheerleaders would n't hurt either	2
0	hard to imagine something could make one 's honey even sweeter but this fills the bill the little jars make it easy for you to try different flavors \( as opposed to being stuck with a large quantity of one \) all of them were quite yummy too the only thing i would change is the brush that 's included it 's tiny which makes it fun to tease and do little bits at a time but it could be just a bit broader the bristles tend to get overwhelmed by the chocolate then you just use your fingers	2
0	if you like them small you wo n't be disappointed tasty though i would upgrade to the bigger ones	2
0	as someone who absolutely hates water crystal light was a life saver for me now that they make it in little packets 'to go ' i can put several in my purse when i go on business trips or vacation and feel good about buying bottled water i'm doing what doctors suggest we all do drink lots of water yet doing it with something that makes it taste good ! the only complaint i have if you can call it a complaint is that they have n't come out with kiwi strawberry in the individual packets yet that is by far my favorite flavor lemonade comes in a close second i highly recommend this product leanne burroughs author of highland wishes and her highland rogue	2
1	i bought this 5 pound bag of candy because the reviews were all beaming about how good these are and i 've bought the gummy frogs in the past and liked those so i thought i 'd give this a try these are gross not only that but they 're huge i recommend the gummi frogs as a better alternative now i know to try out the candy in a smaller portion first before investing in my next 5 pound bag 2 stars because well it 's not fair to people who like these to say they are absolutely terrible but still now i have a 5 pound bag of candy i have to get rid of	2

0	in the midwest some folks think of this as biscotti but do n't be confused it is correctly named it is a toast cookie so when you dunk it be quick about it ! my husbands favorite and quite tasty i like the small almond bits and that i can chew it without dunking \( not at hard as their biscotti see my review \)	2

1	i bought this product because of positive member reviews and and outstanding review in cnet however i just bought a new dell inspiron e1505 that shipped with windows vista home premium and zonealarm 6 5 is flat out incompatible with the new os i downloaded zonealarm 7 0 and that is flat out incompatible as well i'm sure this is a great security suite for windows xp but beware if you have vista there seems to be no update on their website when zonelabs will release a vista compatible zonealarm \( they mention something about after january 2007 but it 's march for crying out loud ! \) so there 's my purchase price of a good product down the drain	4
1	there 's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted this is definitely one of the worst products i have ever bought i did not do much research i think the data may be in there but i could not learn how to make it work the interface is horrific unusable do n't do it	4

0	this works fairly well for me it easily downloads the capital gains from microsoft money the interviews are fairly straightforward however there are a few areas \( like foreign tax credit \) where it should be automated but is n't but on the whole it does a nice job they just need to improve it a little every year then it could be a 5 star item	4

0	i purchased this program about 1 5 years ago i have been casually studying german through other programs for about 4 years the best basic words only is through unforgettable languages \( very basic but easy as heck to learn \) rosetta stone is the best for understanding gender verb usage and adapting to the german style of sentence structure i absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program it is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking the only negative is that the cd has to be used to run the program even with an accelerated cd rom the starting stopping of the cd is distracting if that feature were corrected it would be perfect	4

0	this is the most technically excellent racing sim i have played the physics are perfect the graphics are pleasing and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars the learning curve can be very steep but you can adjust the ai to suit your needs you can also turn on traction control steering aids etc which will get you into the game faster after a couple months you 'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven there is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing if you want a realistic racer buy this game	4

0	frontpage 2003 is a great easy to use wysiwyg web builder most hosting companies support frontpage extensions a set of web robots to help you build a dynamic site similar to dhtml two warnings though 1 \) this full version is too expensive you may qualify to buy the half priced academic version \( search for frontpage 2003 academic on amazon \) 2 \) more important though frontpage is being discontinued as a product altogether and will be replaced by office sharepoint designer \( for businesses \) and expression web \( for everyone else \) you can download the latter for free \( for now at least \) on msft 's website	4
0	this upgrade installed easily with my photoshop 5 5 no problems at all this is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my photoshop 5 5 this is a much less expensive way to upgrade to cs2 rather than purchasing cs2 outright be sure to get the updates after you install the program	4
1	i purchased this program for my personal and home business tax return but it did not include all the forms needed so i had to buy another version from them h r taxcut included all i needed and was 1 2 the price	4
1	like some of the other reviews i loved cool edit pro then adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2 0 i use this program often and tried to give it a chance no way around it it sucks now i am going to use sonar a much better product the only thing i like about 2 0 is that you can burn to a disc from audition that is the only reason why i gave it one star this is not a user friendly program	4
1	first of all this software performs like someones term project why havent these guys been sued yet \? pros nice retail packagingcons not testeddoesnt burn all your filesno supportoverall a waste of moner	4

0	i bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school i used it because its what is being used at my office i wish they had included frontpage instead of one note \( which i really have n't been able to find a use for \) otherwise it works the same as other ms office packages i 've used in the past	4
0	i discovered my ms office had a bug in it and came that way from the factroy i looked word over and it was clean then the program itself it does everything and well and it does it without the tracking bug on it	4
1	great product for what it does ! however my experience with quicken products such as will maker is that there are no updates you 'll have to buy the next year 's version to stay up to date for changes in your state at the end of 2007 the software is obsolete	4
1	i was expecting a lot more from these two cd 's it teaches you a few items of food basic words like hello please and airplane and even teaches you to ask where are the suitcases but then that is about it i was really hoping for more much more	4
0	this is a great productbecause once you install ityou need not use the cd agai	4
0	this software is easy to use it 's like tax software it ask questions you answer has everything i wanted it for and a lot more i would recommend it cheaper than a lawyer	4
0	an excellent item saved me lots of time and money	4
0	turbo tax deluxe is an excellent product but they should make it easier for you to back up without having to go thorugh the whole category to get to one item also they should make it easier to make adjustments to your state return it 's very annoying to find and adjust the state return once you have gone back into your federal return i think it is a very good product but they should make it much easier to navigate to other areas especially for the state return	4
0	i use ms office at work and at home but for my daughter 's computer this was perfect most people do n't need the full version of office and this package has so much for so little money the full version of word is reason enough to spend this amount of money note this is not the latest version but who cares i would say this is one of the best software deals out there unless you need 100 office compatiblity this is the package for you if you do buy the student and teacher version of ms office read the fine print it is for anyone not using it for business	4
1	this product is very nice when it works however i'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me when i attempt to export the image either by saving draging or copying hemera places a transparency over the object making the product worthless i gave it two stars because for the two months it worked it worked well however now it wo n't work at all and as the other reviewer stated support is nearly non existant	4
0	works fine like several other office packages lacks database program access	4
1	while there are many benefits to learning vocabulary with this tool i found it did not help with conversation	4
1	i made the unfortunate mistake of reading fantastic reviews for this product and trying it out myself i went online and purchased the program downloaded and installed on my pc installation worked perfectly i ran a scan and it even found viruses that mcafee missed however any program that used the internet now freezes or takes forever to load after closing web browsers i have to restart before my pc recovers i unistalled the program and now everything works great i'm shopping somewhere else for my antivirus needs	4
0	i have used this product for about 5 years it is easy to use and alot cheaper than having your taxes done by someone else i especially would recommend it to any small business owner	4
1	darkbasic is only good for people very new to programming and interested in games to make a commercial quality game in this language would be lunacy basic just is n't quite flexible enough to do that with ease and the darkbasic renderer looks very very ugly however basic remains very easy to learn and darkbasic has some commands that are fun to toy with if you 're trying to get into serious game development learn c and either learn how to use libraries like opengl or directx or start modding a popular engine like the unreal engine or source and make sure you 've learned a good deal of physics and math	4
1	i would not buy it ! hard to use my machine runs slower since the install	4

0	i have been running windows xp sp2 and would never want to go back to windows me or windows 98 with the xp i rarely need to re boot my system and my pc no longer freezes up there is a built in windows firewall plus a pop up blocker which are both awesome the system is much safer and i have never had a virus worm or trojan horse while running the windows xp home with a good internet security virus program one thing make sure you have at least 256 mb of space available in your pc before starting to download as this does require at least that get it ! you wo n't be disappointed	4
0	i bought adobe acrobat 8 0 professional for home use after having used an older version at work the software was very easy to install activate and register and i liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features since i am active with three community service organizations i welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media binders this program makes it easier to email formal reports create handbills and pamphlets and post them to my web page	4
1	the computer i have now \( about 500 mhz \) is faster than my last one and the earlier version of plus ! worked well with my older model however my current model ca n't process most of the programs available so i just deleted the whole package i intend to get a faster computer in the near future and will use superpack at that time the features look pretty cool but i ca n't give it a favorable rating at this time however when i see how it would work with a faster processor i may re rate my review	4
1	i installed quickbooks pro 2003 on my new computer running vista and had a small problem so i bought an upgrade to 2007 since intuit says it works with vista it does not the software crashes at odd times it also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report it reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day i have set up my old computer which runs xp so i can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the 2007 version i recommend not buying this version if you are running vista os	4

1	the video editing component of this package video wave worked great for me for about a year but it has recently turned into a nightmare ! the audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video and after trying everything i'm convinced that its a problem with the code a quick product search will show others who have had similar problems i would stay away	4
0	the rosetta stone language software was a great investment the product provides learning words together with listening seeing and hearing or the user can select one of these individually or even practice writing words and phrases it provides an easy to use interface and you can learn at your own pace the product has been worth it 's hefty price i do recommend purchasing a german english dictionary to accompany the software i have also had in the past a basic german 101 course prior to using rosetta stone so it may be difficult to start for a person with no knowledge of the german language such as pronunciation of basic words or greetings	4

0	this product is great it is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording the addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner the only problem i have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd if you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need do n't wast time with anything else	4
0	kudos microsoft my last go around with encare was with the 2004 version at that time the program had a cluttered clusmey interface the various modules were n't intuitive or intergrated and it was therefore confusing and not partuiclarly user friendly the new interface is quite simple but very powerful it is well integrated with the web and therefore capable of constant updating perfect for the student and anyone who likes to research topics if you have not tried encarta in a while check it out there is much to like	4
0	the computer game version of the number devil closely follows the book as kids progress through sections on prime numbers the fibonacci series pascal 's triangle and an infinite series approaching one nine of the ten games worked well for us but nobody in the family was ever able to complete the tenth the arrow game we understood the math but could n't react quickly enough to shoot down all the arrows this was disappointing because we could never reach the bonus section all in all though this is a good investment for a child 8 or up who loves or wants to understand the mystery of numbers	4

0	the operating system is a very good operating system for a home computer but obviously if you want a computer with more security features or networking features you should go with windows xp professional at the time that i am writing this which is a long time from when i purchased windows xp it is a time where windows vista is emerging if you plan on upgrading a slightly older computer i recommend windows xp home professional \( based on your requirements \) but if you are looking for a safe operating system for your beast try windows vista but one word of warning about vista the user account control \( uac \) is a pain in the butt	4

0	i am average when it comes to design but the tutorial helped me in creating a logo and it 's cheaper and better for me to create one myself than pay someone to do it i like the tracing feature which allows you to remove parts of a photo to place in a new background to get the most out of this software you really need to be familiar with a lot of the features already and there 's a lot i am missing i will just have to take more time to keep practicing and learning from trial and error	4

1	the editing portion of the software is completly separate from the cd portion of the software and does not store in the same file cd 's can hold upto approx 500 photos but the softwware will not accept more and allow you to discard down to burn 500 i was told by nova development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the cd writer was a free add on to the program the box and program info did not indicate that i offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere	4

0	i was happy enough with the function of office xp and held off upgrading for a long time what pushed me over was when i switched to using outlook as my email client accessing quite a few pop3 email accounts for various websites getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty i spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working well office 2003 's outlook comes with it 's own spam filter it works it 's simple and it 's unobtrusive the other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles but the upgrades i appreciate most are in outlook	4

1	nsw 2007 \( or 2006 \) premiere is useless when it comes to vista and considering it comes pre packaged with every pc known to man \( desktop or laptop \) this is unforgiveable norton av has an update but that is a far cry from the 100 price of systemworks that must be uninstalled according to ms vista maybe with the 2008 versiontruth be known system works has saved my azz a number of time since the 2003 version but now it is useless	4

0	i feel home designer suite 6 is a good value for the price it obviously is not a full blown pro program which i think many people expect however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning it is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual or on the provided cd	4
0	this dvd rom game is so interesting and there are even some questions that i do n't know after watching every episode numerous times i highly recommend this for friends fans of all ages regardless of whether or not you have seen every episode also i love that the game can be played by only one person for those nights that you find yourself alone and want a few friends to keep you company	4

1	i was very disappointed with this program but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases even so the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating i learned more icelandic \( along with correct pronounciations \) while in iceland than i did with this program and besides anyone under the age of 50 in iceland speaks english	4

1	we are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet we cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us \( i e child care \) and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs what 's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured finally the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read	4

1	despite many attempts and a complete reinstall of windows xp my xp machine refused to load easy cd creator 5 platinum rendering the progam disc and all update discs useless probably if you already had the program running in a 98 environment and then upgraded to xp you could keep it running with patches and updates so take statements by resellers that they provide update discs with a grain of salt if you cannot install the primary program the update disc is of no use the program is a good one but you have to run it on a 98 machine	4

1	i 've been a user of pinnacle version 8 \( which i loved \) and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer dvds what a disappointment this upgrade has been crash after crash what is most disappointing is that pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could help them develop a better product this means to me that they knowingly released bad code and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a 100 guess what i do n't want to help pinnacle build a better product i want a product that works when i purchase it lesson learned next time i read a bad review on a product i'm staying away	4

1	as everyone else has said this product is not at all what it should be it slows down the internet browsing to a crawl \( my laptop that has crashed several times is several years older and runs wireless loads pages faster than my new computer with mcafee \) you ca n't close it as others have said other than uninstalling the funniest part i 've found however is that it warns you the first time it tries to access being amused i refused the program permission to update itself other than removing the program it was the best thing i did using mcafee	4
1	this product could put user customer 's life at risk the mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off road this is the worst product that i have used in my life	4
0	this is a well done operating system i use the 64bit version and all but just a few of my software titles work without any problems all my hardware has 64bit drivers overall this is a good product and i would buy it again because i went from a 32bit o s to a 64bit o s i had to boot from the dvd to install it but i was able to install it using the key without any problems nor did i have to reinstall it afterwards as some website suggest you have to do	4

0	for the first time in several versions microsoft has changed the file format however it is for the better the new files are all compressed using the zip compression format so files are much smaller \( old files are 3 4 times larger than new files \) the new file formats are supposed to be compatible with a cross platform specification \( i e linux geeks can open office documents \) the new interface is radically different do not install this if you have a large project to complete the interface is so different you will not complete on time however after a month of so you will wonder how you ever got along without it	4
0	this program is very easy to use and the projects are beautiful installation is self explanatory this also goes for the prepararation of cards ect detailed instructions apear at each step at the top of the window as the user moves his her mouse pointer over various portions of the graphics if you are looking for an easy to use program with great results this is the one to get with the cost of cards being what it is this program will pay for itself very quickly relatives will like the fact that they are getting greetings which have been personalized i recommend this program highly	4
0	maybe it 's because i was upgrading from an older version 2002 but i found the new features to be very good for example the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used it was catching junk from the very beginning and has missed very few things i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email also the security features are far superior to the 2002 version and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use installation was seemless i think it might be a little overpriced but considering how long i will keep it it 's not too bad	4
0	i'm an amateur at website design building so understand that i'm not very deep in dreamweaver 's abilities however i got the program to switch from adobe golive cs2 which had many quirks bugs and frustrations \( one example while you upload your changed files to the web server in golive you ca n't do anything else in the program single tasking ! \? ! \? ! \) after just 30 minutes or so of working with dreamweaver to update my site i'm already sure i 've made the right decision ! i have a long way to go in learning what it can do but my first impressions of the product are excellent	4
0	the new adobe acrobat has a cleaner look and feel and is more user friendly i especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any microsoft application which allow you to create a pdf in one click rather than having to go to file and print some functionality as before with some new organization and better look feel	4
0	wow ! i must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003 it did take some time to get the hang of it because microsoft changed around the icons and buttons however i do like it because now in word excel and powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide in the end i think the 2007 is much more user friendly than 2003 i recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the new 2007 microsoft office	4
0	i have used this software from the very first as a paintshop product and it still delivers it has improved with this version i reckon i have tried all other albums and quick editors but this remains the best for more detailed work a more expansive editor is needed but that is not the purpose of this program what it claims to do it does well if only it had some way of adjusting the mid tones a simple histogram would make this a top ranking program	4
0	i liked the older version better i hope to get use to the new version	4

0	adobe standard 8 0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions if you do research and want a better interface design and functions then you need this new version of adobe it is an incredible tool for gathering sorting copying and formatting information it also is faster than older versions see details \( above \) on amazon recommended for all information knowledge workers	4
0	the fact that they call this premier is a little overdone the reality is that this is the pro version with a few bells and whistles which in most cases do not warrant the additional price	4
1	i upgraded from wordperfect office 12 to x3 but have returned the upgrade to wordperfect the much touted ability to import pdf files is so poorly implemented that it is all but unusable in addition the wordperfect mail component will not load data files while my antivirus \( zonealarm \) is running in the background corel technical support takes no responsibility for the incompatability do not upgrade unless these issues are addressed	4

0	not bad however in version 10 was able to use cntrl to zoom in used the on the number pad now this function does n't work and the only that works is that in the top row of the keyboard the zoom out in the number pad still works but not the plus i say that 's not good why ruin things with an upgrade	4
0	version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version 7 increases one 's ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice	4
0	excellent software to manage your large backup hard drives you can format partition split merge and a whole lot of other things if you purchase a large backup hard drive i recommend this software and the acronis true image software with both you can partition your drive and have a ghost copy of your c drive in one partition and daily backups of my documents in another this way in case of a hd crash you have a bootable backup \( note that the software that comes with backup hard drives will not make a bootable backup of your hard drive \) thats why i recommend both acronis software packages	4
1	if you own a newer dvd camcorder that is manufactured by panasonic hitachi and others that records your movies in a vro format you can not use this product you will have to buy an additional program that will cost about 40 to convert the vro format to a avi wav or mpeg format if you own a camcorder that records in vro do some research before you waste 80 on this program	4

0	i love toast and have had it since version 3 do n't have tivo so ca n't comment on usability but for everything else it works better than software that comes with mac ca n't wait to try double density and blu ray with which this is compatible even earlier versions could burn more different kinds of media than the burn software that came with the mac a friend of mine just switched from pc to mac and this was the first software that i suggested he buy as another reviewer said if you have toast you do n't need popcorn the best ! !	4

1	back in the day \( 1970 's \) these were made with a stiff strong plastic rigid insert w the poly rope outside this gave the leash a realistic tight but curved under own weight appearance a believable realistic bounce to the dog with the most imperceptible wrist action on the part of the dog walker however this piece of crap has a thick soft wire inside the leash and this gives the leash a very phony fake looking too heavy all bent up look piece of junk piece of junk piece of junk !	5
0	i think the hair may be a bit over done but everything else is right on i like the make up and the clothes and she does seem to resemeble veronica from the archie comics i remember reading as a child i give her 4 three quarter stars \( it would be five if the hair were better \) she's still a great doll though nearly perfect ! ! ! ! !	5
0	this thing is great our 4 year old loves it the working drawbridge breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great considering the size and number of pieces it was remarkably easy to put together allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly but the directions are excellent only complaint is that some of the small pieces that do n't always want to stay together some of the details will likely be missing after a few weeks overall very happy with it	5
1	i bought this toy for my three yr old she was excited but then one of the dolls fell apart its pelvis broke and the legs fell out super glue might fix it but i'm not sure i 'd recommend it for an older child who would n't play with it so roughly but for the price i wanted it to last more than three days	5
1	it seems like a nice complete set of playfood except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard and i 've thrown most of them out already it does n't take much to crush them there are much nicer sets out there and there are separate pieces sold on ebay that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better not worth the money	5

1	i thought this would be a great addition to our tub toy collection i was wrong it does n't work ! ! ! ! we tried shampoo and baby wash in it and there was no mountain of bubbles this product does n't work save your money ! !	5
0	this is the greatest thing i was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn not only has it lived up to my 3 year old but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play it has not torn it sparks great imagination all her friends go to school now this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also and best of all we can store it anywhere when we are done she has even learned to close it up and put it away i highly recommend this bus to all ! !	5
0	this case is nice and tough it holds all the accessories for the fp3 player securely i gave it 4 stars because i think things like fp3 players need a home and it serves that purpose great it matches with the player and is built to withstand kids i did take a star off my rating because as it does have a smallish loop to hold it by it should really have a handle little hands need something easy to hold on to and the little loop does not suffice for any purpose i could see	5

1	horrible i was very excited to play this as i am a huge fan of the arcade game of course i was n't expecting the quality to be the greatest but i was hoping for something playable track ball is stingy graphics are atrocious and there is only one course to play i have played better functioning playable golf games 20 years ago on an pc the idea was great but this just was n't made well do n't waste your money on this	5
1	i have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept i have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept the lines are blurry there is no focus to begin with but the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base whenever you move it touch it etc the dry erase markers do n't erase from the board and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it i ca n't fathom buying a new light bulb at 4 95 s h after a total hour of use in two sessions i think it 's probably wiring who knows but it 's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage	5
1	whatver your favorite fruit may be this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games it is basically boring and ill conceived i have played it a few times with my kids and found it to be of no particular interest on any level it is neither fun exciting or challenging for them or me i strongly recommend you try a cranium game or how about chess \? \? \? the only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game is that it 's better than tv which is n't saying much	5
0	this toy was an instant success with my son who is six he figured out how to put together the track in minutes unlike other construction toys skyrail is not limited to one or two designs my son can create endless configurations including loop the loops that really work this toy is also easy to disassemble the track and connectors seem a little flimsy but so far after many many uses none of the pieces has broken	5
0	when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings she declared that she wanted a set for christmas she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son in law monopolize them with their little competitions these are wonderful for the imagination and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy	5

0	it is a magnificient item ! so simple and beautiful yet full of really small details and hello here is johnny cash ! looks really great on foot with his guitar just like real i strongly recommend it to all cash fans	5
1	i am very disappointed with this product the volume is not adjustable and the default sound setting is so loud that it can be heard in another room even with a door closed electronic toy voices are occasionally annoying or difficult to understand this is the case here so needing to have something repeated loudly can get on your nerves i will be more careful in the future and not assume that all speaking electronic toys come with adjustable volume buyers beware !	5

1	what a super cheap rip off of the original rubik 's cube that was introduced to us in the mid '70 's seems like every doctor 's office break room friend 's basement etc had one of these cubes to kill time with main reason that i personally did n't like this modern version was that after the first day or two the colored stickers start to peel off the rubik 's cube had it 's day in this high tech age i cannot see many kids having any interest in this item they might actually have to 'use' their brain please do n't bring back the pet rock	5
1	like many others the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well who can we contact for help \? there is no information on the box	5
1	i have to agree with everyone before me flimsy hard to put together does n't stay together impossible to close my four old who is obsessed with batman lost interest after 5 minutes and i really ca n't blame him spend your 50 on something else ! ! ! not a good purchase ! ! ! ! !	5
1	this toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow the dozen or so chambers up the instructions were terrible you have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next the chambers do not stay inflated and some do n't work at all my son does still have fun with it but i would n't buy it again	5

0	my son received this as a christmas gift and thoroughly enjoys it this is not a regular dvd it is designed to go with the read with me dvd system \( a separate remote control that works with it on your tv \) a previous reviewer was not aware of this so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error	5
0	i bought this as a halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004 he loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house he does n't really use it much anymore but now my 18 month old loves it ! he can actually follow the whole progression turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time this toy has been great for our family it is pretty durable some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore but considering what it has gone through it has performed amazingly well	5
1	we were very disappointed in this toy it does not spin fast enough to make the paint spray evenly over the cardboard my older children had a spin art toy that was great it made the most spectacular designs this is not worth the effort or money	5
1	great concept but bad design both of my children have had one for a year due to the discomfort they never use it ! it needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around	5
1	this is fun and a good idea but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor it fell apart the first time we had it up and while you can put it back together unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds it is n't worth it the keyboard itself is fine the microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it but the keyboard does the microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away i would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead or if you buy this product do n't expect to use the keyboard stand for long but it can work without it	5

1	since purchasing this executive set i have purchased another one at a local store although both sets are relatively the same the instruction package with my second set is much better the sea monkeys in the executive set lasted about a month and a half this was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague we did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them the instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months i believe the executive set is overpriced as well	5
1	i bought this toy for my son for christmas i thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is so loud ! it scares him everytime i turn it on and there is no way to control the volume i know lots of kid toys are loud but i have never heard one as loud as this one	5

0	i bought this set for my grandsons 2nd birthday my son found it very easy to assemble and my daughter in law loves it because it is a lovely piece of furniture my grandson loves to sit at the table and look at books or build with blocks this is a sturdy set that will last for many years	5
0	my son got this game as a gift i brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day the kids love this game and request it over and over many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes it is a great vocabulary builder i also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them i use these when we are studying parts of speech they have to come up with a noun \( adjective verb etc \) that begins with that letter this is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting	5
1	well this game is fun but i ca n't believe some people thought that it would actually take you into space ! well its kinda stupid you just take apart a house puzzle according to some stupid card but still the game is really fun delane	5
0	now you can add risk to your libary in this handsome bookshelf edition the game remains a perennial favorite and in this day and age of global conquest you can play out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming anyone atleast not physically but be prepared for a few bruised egos especially when combatants start teaming up on weaker victims while the places and names do n't exactly match today 's geographical boundaries kids can still get some sense of the world in which we live even if the object of the game remains to wipe each other out	5
0	unavailable for some time the sky high suspension bridge is back once you have the ramps to get the track up there it really stands out as a part of the railroad assembly was required but routine the directions were quite adequate there are no stickers to wiggle into place	5
0	this toy is fantastic although i have the english speaking toy it still has a similar sounding italian accent to the toy if you enjoyed the films i highly recommend these toys ! ! ! is it possible to buy an italian speaking luigi	5
1	the toy is a good idea but it needs to be more user friendly instructions are hard to follow even for adults maybe not quite so much activities at one time could simplify some for younger players	5
0	i originally bought this for my husband an emt ff i wrote a poor review of company based upon my entire experience w this storefront and the other items i had purchased i was n't terribly pleased with the pen but my husband took it to work and loved it said it went off several times from pocket while driving and the entire er loved it overall it is fun and writes and does what it 's supposed to make you laugh	5
0	very complete with a lot of things to play for hours my daughter still plays with it and she is now four years old definitely it was worth it highly recommended	5
0	these 'cars' characters are all quality die cast replicas that kids young and not so young can enjoy the kids love playing with them and so far our 'cast members' are still intact but they do look so good you might want to put one on your desk the details painless shopping and quick shipping as usual on amazon	5
0	many people are not time oriented i have used this both in the classroom and at home it allows the children a visual clue to how much time has gone past i tell them they have 30 minutes to complete something i set green for 20 yellow for 7 and red for 3 i do n't have to say anything else this eliminates waiting time once they realize that at red they need to be picking up and getting ready for the next lesson	5
1	we bought this item for our son 's birthday we assembled it exactly as shown in the directions the cars do not launch properly into the loop we have yet to have one car make it through the entire track also when you place cars to launch and crash they shoot clear across the room one knocked our daughter in the chest ! not worth what we spent on the item and we are finding ourselves increasingly dissappointed with hot wheels items	5
1	my daughter loves strawberry shortcake this interactive doll and book are uninteresting and do not work together very well the book has to be on a flat surface and then still does not work well the doll and book quickly became seperate toys and neither are played with very often	5
0	excellent product ! i really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve after playing all 50 you can just start all over again ! fun fun fun game ! thanks	5
1	this was purchased for my 2 yr old son who loved to draw and scribble he was so excited to see thomas riding the track well it worked the day we opened it and never again ! i would recommend not spending the money on this one and get the regular aquadoodle for 1 2 the price ! you are not able to wash the mat so if you get anything on it \( eg crayon or dirt \) you ca n't get it out	5
0	i like that everything fits in the case my 2 year old enjoys dumping all the pieces on the floor no big deal you can also store a few parts in the potato and take it with you very happy with purchase	5
1	this product is awful it wo n't stay together and is very frustrating to both myself and my three year old what a disappointment	5
0	what more can you say \? it 's durable it 's fun it folds so nicely and be put away ! good buy	5
0	excellent i love chimps and watch all documentaries so i had to have this one for my birthday and i am thirty seven years old i would buy from you again	5
1	purchased this item for traveling our son does n't travel well so we purchased this item for him and it does n't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows the straps are material and velcro on the ends how do you attach these straps \? so now we just let him play with it being free it does n't attach	5
0	my 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents she loves the disney princesses and was ver excited i was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down she plays with it in her room almost everyday and i love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep overall we are very pleased with this tent although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that i could play in there with her	5
0	whenever we take this bike to the park boys and men of every description crown around it in awe my son who is seven and so far not athletic at all loves the recognition not to mention the nifty spin outs he can perform for everyone watching we just wish it came in an adult size	5
0	this game is very exciting for my son he is five i am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer i enjoy watching him do the math \( one with the coins \) as well as watching him make words	5
0	this doll is absolutely breathtaking i bought her for my gift closet but i think i 'll keep her for myself ! the price was only 5 29 during the special toys r us sale plus free shipping could n't ask for a better deal or a prettier collectible doll	5
0	my son has really enjoyed this however after marks are made with the washable markers it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually	5
1	i only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid i compared amazon 's listing with the manufacture listing and ordered we did not get what we ordered we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume not the swimming one ! this was from santa and i'm sorry but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old 's eyes just breaks your heart of course it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands for the first time in my years of shopping i feel robbed	5
0	this game is awesome ! it is addictive though so be prepared a little complicated once you get started but becomes easier best if someone already knows the game to teach it really fun though	5
1	it is just like mr potato head except not as many pieces there are n't very many options to dress sbsp but he is always a fun toy after a year of play he is a little torn at the edges but overall in good shape	5
1	we got this guitar for my 4 year old she loved it but it stopped functioning after less than a month i thought i need to change batteries but even after that it did n't work now i do n't know what to do with it i did n't keep the box so that i could return it very disappointed	5
1	i recieved this itema s a gift i thought it would be great i was wrong ! the designs it gives you are really cool but the ploish that comes with this is awful ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	5
1	i bought 2 pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet \( and never worked again \) very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun	5
1	my 7 year old son received the giga ball for christmas it was a big hit he and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours unfortunately the very next day it pretty much fell apart i did n't expect it would last very long but had hoped that it would last more than one day	5
0	my nephew cooper put on his superman suit right away he especially liked the suit is inflatible good choiceand excellent price	5
1	i purchased two of these cases for my daughters ages 5 and 7 but we were all disappointed with them it supposedly holds 3 barbies and their accessories but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in they also come apart everytime the girls open them and they are hard for the girls to put back together they are good for keeping all the little barbie accessories out of the way i just wish they were better quality a friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter \( with a zipper \) and she says it is great but i have not been able to find that item anywhere	5
1	concept was good but fails because its not constructed well after 2 months the toy 's electronics went out	5
1	very disappointed this item never got shipped to me we waited close to 2 months to find out it was n't coming	5
1	we bought three of these over the last few months since they keep breaking the last one lasted a single afternoon and the kids were upset when it broke yet again its not made very well dont waste your mone	5
0	well i got this ahwile ago i got this toy and i was very excited i made the blanket but it was a hassel the glue did n't work and the instuctions are a bit ocnfusing but it is fun when your done ! !	5
1	this item is really small i did n't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item in hindsight i would n't have order it had i paid more attention i think the other products from haba \( eggs and teabags \) are worth the money for the size	5
1	i nearly bought this until i read that it involves cardboard and stickers that 's shameful search amazon 's partners and other major booksellers for the nostalgia edition of stratego it runs 4 or 5 more it has plastic pieces with metallic paint this game is a blast you and your kids are going to play it a lot	5
1	my 4 yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas and santa was kind enough to bring it for her the quality is fine but it just does n't do much she played with it for the first day and has touched it maybe twice since i 've seen these on clearance everywhere i 've gone lately too if your child is into playing mommy this is cute but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks does n't really equate to lasting play value with this one	5
1	my twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3 they loved it ! ! ! the dog is so cuddly and cute they loved playing pretend with the accessories my only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off the syringe was coming apart and the brush had lost a couple of bristles the boys had not played rough with it it just was n't the quality that i had hoped for it is a real favorite of theirs i am just afraid that it wo n't last as long as their imaginations i think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy a real winner for young children in the hospital	5
1	the pixar cars characters from mattel can be purchased from target walmart or toys r us for around 3 50 do n't be taken in by these rip off merchants these are not in short supply and can be found with patience	5
0	my 3 year old received this puzzle as a gift for his 3rd yr birthday i was n't so sure if he was ready for the puzzle at the age of 3 but four months after his birthday together with his cousins he started putting the pieces together he is now 3 5 yrs and knows how to complete it all by himself within less than 10min i give ten stars	5
1	i would n't even give this toy one star if i was n't forced to mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980 's graphics and even worse sound it sounds like my husband 's 1985 casio watch the only thing they did well with this product is market it i gave this to my daughter from santa and i am still going to return it	5
0	i wrote some reviews of lila doll saying she is my favorite but this one is extremly pretty her face is so pretty and all her clothes and cute i say diffrent i say that lila is better than polly ! lila also comes with a cute horse and carrige wow how can you think spending 25 dollars on polly will be better when you can spent less than 10 dollars on lila and get a real cute and worth the money doll	5
0	this game is great to get to know your friends and family in a new light it encourages deep converasations but can also be a fun and energetic game you 'll find yourselves wrapped up in topics that you 'd never discuss otherwise	5
1	i hate to write a bad review i think it 's actually the first one i 've ever written this was a gift from my husband 's work christmas party for our 2 year old the extension on the pole is a stiff plastic piece and does n't stay extended so that you can catch the fish it folds back on itself so our son was n't able to catch anything with it it would be better if the extension did n't bend at all but just stayed in one place and even if it did that i would n't buy it it 's more fun to have a pole with a string so you can reel it in	5
1	my daughter loves this toy she has the treehouse and the school house she plays with them often my only complaint is that they fall apart she does not mind i just snap it back together and she keeps playing	5
1	remember spirograph by kenner you played with as a kid \? this thing hasbro sells under the same name is not that toy it is obviously of cheap quality parred down to a handful of gears and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work ! stick with the original which means purchase it used on ebay but do not buy hasbro 's spirograph	5
0	my 18 month old has been playing with this for three months now and just loves it she even knows now which color balls goes in the correct slot she whacks them all in puts the balls back and keeps doing this over and over and over	5
0	muffet vs spider ! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene again the turn is to the s m pink black leather bondage look similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it 's a great display piece the downfall from five stars is that when setup muffet is almost obscured by the spider both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	5
0	for scrabble aficionados with children who often travel long distances by plane this game is a must travel accessory	5
0	i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products	5
1	while the doll is beautiful i do n't think she is a good representation of chinese people because if you look at the picture of a close up of her face you can see that her eyes are big and round just like a european her nose also is upturned while some may say that some asians do have rounder eyes most do not and i do n't think this doll looks chinese enough	5
0	the shout about line of dvd games are a great way of getting people together we play teams \( at least 3 5 people on each \) and it is always a noisy and fun crowd	5
1	of all the first leappad books to buy make this the last one on your list my daughter has no interest in this one whatsoever ! 60 br 62 60 br 62 \( i have two friends who have said the same thing	5
1	this is the best deck ever ! but if you are looking for armed dragon lv7 go to soul of the deulist booster packs because this does n't have it but i love red eyes darkness dragon	5
0	i was disappointed when i opened the box and set up the tent because it was much smaller than i expected it to be my friend 's daughter has an almost identical tent which is much bigger apparently there are two different kinds one made by playhut and one made by the disney store	5
0	i got this message from the recipient 's mother he loves it really ! well made drawer shelf design it 's heartwarming when he settles down industriously using his art supplies	5
1	i bought this toy from my son for his 2nd birthday less than a week ago it is designed for the sandbox but has already stopped working because sand has gotten into all the sliding parts it also has a locking mechanism that is too difficult for even my almost 4 year old to figure out but my kids love to ride around on it it 's just too bad the rest of it is so poorly designed	5
1	this product reminds me of thick slightly mushy sand that you would play with at the beach except it comes in colors playdough is much easier to work with if you want to build items objects shapes my daughter will play with playdough for hours but with this product she lost interest after 10 minutes	5
0	as a brilliant but ruthless leader of the piraka zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure the mask of life ! all the piraka have two tools yes 2 each one has a zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot but in real life they would be the size of basketballs zaktan 's three pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal nothing will get in his way or it will be severely punished	5
1	this is nothing like the spirograph i grew up playing with as everyone else mentioned the gears are much too thin and slip constantly my 6 year old son was completely frustrated after wrestling with the design flaws do n't waste your money !	5
0	this item is sooooo cute ! garfield is dressed in his jammies and is clutching pookie in his left arm we highly recommend ty goodnight garfield especially if you are a garfield fan	5
1	looks great but not worth the money my son begged for this toy and it was a big dud almost impossible to fly i think once out of 50 tries were we successful made out of flimsy material it chipped and scraped right away do not buy this toy ! ! ! ! !	5
1	the pixel chix 2 story house was suppose to intertwine with other pixel chix products i had bought my granddaughter the car that you were suppose to hook up to the house so that the person could come out of the house and get into the car and vise versa did not work returned this item	5
0	my 5 year old twins really like this game it is sometimes difficult to balance the toppings but that is why they like it so much on the other hand my 3 year old finds it very frustrating if you are considering purchasing this for a younger child you can rough up the pizza part with a piece of sand paper to help with the slippage	5
1	this game fell apart after we got out of the box i did n't even get a chance to play this with my five year old before it fell apart be careful i would n't get this if you have children who are rough on their toys	5
1	i support the comments that others make this game is so poorly designed it is laughable i cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once forget trying to follow the directions they left out many important rules the board does n't work especially the way the pieces fit into it and what a terrible ending with a spinner that does n't even work like a spinner what is up with that \? forget this game	5
0	i first purchased the winnie the pooh soft 'n silly tigger for my son when he was 4 months old he is now 14 months and loves his tigger we now have 2 tiggers one as a back up and he carries them everywhere he goes it 's a great toy for young children to sleep with being soft and cuddly tigger has been a great comfort for my son and i do n't know what i would have done with out them !	5
1	the idea behind this is n't too bad and my 4 year old really enjoyed them for a short time but it has some really ridiculous quirks the shoes are not on any type of timer so they will stay on indefinitely unless your child turns off each of them individually so what ends up happening of course is dead batteries within a day or so the wand and the tiara both work fine so maybe that set would n't be too bad but it annoys me that they would even release something as ridiculous as this	5
0	my granddaughter requested this for christmas and i had a hard time finding it until i checked the amazon site it's just what she wante	5
0	while nothing beats wood blocks \( in my opinon \) we had these first and they are fun ! we like that they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate and not painful if they fall on you ! the only downside is that they are large and storing them in the bag is like putting together a puzzle they just fit storing them in a toy box fills the box with wasted space so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box it 's worth the hassle if you have space for them and do n't mind stacking them up and teaching your little one to	5
0	this toy teaches history and stories to improve the imaginations of kids everywhere it and its others are a must have	5
1	extremely disappointing bought the toy for my son for christmas it did n't come with the battery \( 30 extra \) and the battery is still sold out everywhere including online almost a month later do n't bother there are lots of other great rc toys out there	5
1	this is really the dumbest thing ive ever seen yu gi oh is such a rip off get something good anime princess chick age 1	5
0	excellent product ! i really appreciate the option to choose any of the 50 given mystery cases to solve after playing all 50 you can just start all over again ! fun fun fun game ! thanks	5
0	my 3 3 4 yr old got these for christmas and he loves them plays with them almost every day we bought both dinosaur kits and they are fun to combine together my son loves to not only put together the proper dinosaurs but make up his own creatures as well a fun way for dinosaur loving kids to engage in some creative think outside the box play	5
0	murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels he was brought to the island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line as shy as he is strong murdoch can often be found seeking peace and quiet this wooden train is a 2 piece set joined with magnets my son loves playing with this mustard yellow engine on his wooden tracks very sturdy construction and a great addition to the thomas line	5
0	this costume kit was a great deal for the price my son loves it	5
1	i got this for my eight year old unfornately i read the reviews on amazon just before he opened it not before i bought it this is a great idea very poorly implemented i am completely dissappointed and if i had not bought it at a final clearance sale would be bringing it back my son 's previous method of holding a piece of paper over what he wants to copy and then taping them to a well lit window is much better and cheaper	5
0	i was pleasantly surprised at the quality and size of the pool the price is quite reasonable and i was not expecting such a great deal	5
1	hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it easily assembled up within 60 seconds i have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground there was no rope or stakes with the purchase i am unaware if these should have been included two entrances into the hideaway the front inverted t entrance is great however the rear is a porthole type entrance not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom material not that durable but with care there should be no issues a lot bigger than it looks on the site which was a nice surprise	5
0	we had so much fun with this game there are truth or dares and all sorts of fun questions ! i definatly recommend this game if you are having a party or even just a few people who want to have a good time ! totally worth buying this one	5
1	there are many significant shortcomings in this interactive dvd game i do not recommend it at all it is not at all like the real feud the most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order since it reveals them in order or you lose no steals no strikes sadly i ca n't return it since its a dvd game	5
1	i bought this for my 5 year old daughter for christmas she played the sound game she always got the answer correct but 60 70 of the time the bear still said it was incorrect the rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing therefore this is not a learning toy and it is no fun after trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was she decided she hated the thing and did n't ever want to play with it again i took the thing back to the store and got a refund	5
0	this is a simple pirate ship tub toy with two backyardigans characters my pirate enthusiasts \( ages 6 4 and 2 \) love it it does n't move or make noise but it floats well and is sturdy the best part is that the characters fit in the bottom of the ship for easy storage	5
0	the instructions could of been better on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out you had to take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it would slow the ball down then you just put ribbon on the outline of the other target otherwise i it is holding up great so far !	5
0	i have a three year old son he loves these take along toys we take them every where with us the tracks stay together very well we move them from room to room and never have to take them apart we have almost every part of the take along thomas the train items	5
1	this is a horrible edition of this game it has a limited amount of games and it does n't play like the tv game at all save some money and buy the old boxed editions from or get the newest version you 'll like it a lot more	5
1	this paint brush globs out the paint does n't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint we went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you ca n't get the brush in it to suck the paint up i am so disappointed	5
0	purchased the batman laptop computer at target for christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old he was totally drawn in because it is batman but the games kept his interest the entire family enjoyed trying the different games dad a musician enjoyed the music game graphics are super i love the way batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even worth the 38 99 i paid at target on sale for sure	5
0	my niece could n't put this down after she opened it she had lots of fundoing tricks for her relatives at christmas the components of the setare very good quality i patted myself on the back for discovering this winner gift	5
0	we love this game all members of the family can play it and we 've enjoyed it as a family many time	5
0	i do n't know why poor scrat got so many bad reviews my kids absolutely love this toy they laugh hysterically every time and they 're 4 1 2 and 7 he does have a tendency to fall down and does n't scoot very well but the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money	5
1	the beads and charms are nice enough but for the price you get very little with this kit only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers plus the charms there 's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies	5
0	the item arrived in perfect condition and right when i was told it would be here i am very happy with this product and seller would have no problem doing busy with them agai	5
0	apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered \( on time incidentially ! \)	5

0	my eight and nine year old sons are big lego fans i bought one set for each of my boys and they each built a different model both models came out great the parts fit together beautifully and the finished product moves very well when played with the vehicles are even better than they look in the pictures on the box this was the first technic set that they tried i hope they enjoy future technic sets as much	5
1	the controller range is less than 40 feet this car is much too fast for the short range it is very easy to outrun the contoller there is also a delay between control input and vehicle response all batteries were new and fully charged checked with a meter a scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference the older tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time	5
1	my 2 year old son loves to cook and to serve mommy and daddy meals from his kitchen my only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor it is n't very sturdy but i'm not unhappy with this purchase	5
1	i purchased this for about 20 00 and i followed the directions carefully despite that a coin slipped into the mechanism there was no way to remove it even though i tried that as carefully as possible i threw the device in the trash i did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins and i now separate coins by hand the advantage of the tubes is that they hold exactly the right number of coins so you avoid counting them	5
0	it 's cute well packaged and easy \( but time consuming \) to put together for the price it ca n't be beat too bad there 's no photo she 'll use it for a while and we 'll sell it online when we are done and probably get most of our money back	5
0	i bought my girls ages 7 and 4 this product earlier this spring it was easy to assemble but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process it has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use when our play group meets here the kids line up to have a turn over and over again i would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands a very durable product and a fun physical activity	5
0	every time i see my twin daughters riding these bikes around i make a promise to write a review of the product here i am fulfilling my promise they were able to pedal the bike within 2 3 days of getting them they are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that i can carry both in the back of my small car \( 89 chevy camaro \) and are light enough that i can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike the only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns	5
1	i purchased this product along with the koi and turtle and they worked for one day the koi would not turn off unless the batteries were pulled out the turtle would not turn on unless you physically held the button in and the fish just quit altogether and sunk to the bottom of the pool	5
0	my really likes this train puzzle he knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it it goes straight across and is over 10 feet long there is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter he will say q quail or n nut when he is putting the piece on the pieces are easy to attach thick and very sturdy the pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off this would make a really nice gift for a 2 4 year old the box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in	5
1	rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales he is shamed into giving them to everyone sounds like a communist primer	5
1	my 10 mo old son showed no particular interest in this table i did not like it much either why would a 10 mo old show any interest in table items that sing \? i have left it without legs two minutes after i installed the legs my son nearly fell with the table on his face had to uninstall them not good for active infants also not very entertaining buy the one from leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this \( might have more balance though but i do not know for sure \)	5

0	these coins are nice and heavy they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch my son uses them like jack sparrow does in the movie so he does n't die in our play battles however they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped it would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real us currency that is large and heavy	5
0	when the toa and all the first bionicles came out it was very simple and straigthforward bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad now with the pirahka we have villians claiming to be toa ! and the matoran believe them ! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon it looks really cool and can change also the little ball launcher \( i forget what it 's called \) is a lot of fun \( i shot my brother with it x3 \) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome ! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying it does n't really get in the way	5

0	i purchased the parents magazine version first and my one year old son did n't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this hasbro toy i purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since the buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time he also enjoys teething on the keys i highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys	5

1	this high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies when screwing together the sections i managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy this toy is very basic the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth invest in some power tools and make your own i guarantee it would be better than this one	5
1	the main issue is the controls we are having a hard time getting this thing to fly well and the idea of pulling down to go down is weird to us pilot types it tends to just nose dive regardless we will give it another go at the park tomorrow but so far all it does is crash that it 's still in one piece is amazing	5
1	lego is a great product unfortunately this one 's just a little too ambitious my son fell in love with this and begged for it for chanukah but once we got it put together it would n't stay together to play with it 's great to make smaller planes with but the original plane just fell apart under it 's own weight	5

0	we received this for my daughter 's 4th birthday it has been a lot of fun to play simple enough for her to play and hard enough to grow with her for the past year although it has a lot of pieces they have remained durable and have withstood tiny fingers	5
1	after waiting for 1 month to get this toy i cannot tell you how disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it absolutely this thing is a waste of money ! it is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it the image is impossible to see with any amount of detail do not buy this toy ! i would give it zero stars if i could	5
0	my son loves this toy it is the perfect height for my 14 month old \( he got it when he was 12 months and it was great then too \) he can play with it sitting or standing he loves to make baskets and i can teach him numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score he loves to spin the football and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit the ball with the bat he uses the bat it came with to hit other balls around the house this toy is a family favorite	5
0	even though i dont have this i think is the most cutest thing i have ever seen	5
1	this is not a very fun toy my got tired of filling the paint chamber because it would empty so quickly he also ended up dipping the brush into the paint jars he went through both jars of paint in under 10 minutes and was finished with the toy there was n't enough paint to even create a picture the happy birthday pic on the back of the package must 've taken over 20 bottles and a very skilled artist i think crayola should stick to making crayons	5

0	we love this game it seems to be the most fun with 5 or 6 people although my husband and i also enjoyed the 2 person version we do not usually use the board we just use a scorepad to keep track of points once you catch on to the game it 's not too hard to come up with answers highly recommended	5

0	i bought this mostly for the container i had individual play doh products like the barber set that came in it 's own box i'm able to put all play doh things into this container and everything is in one spot no more boxes and sorting i even still have space for more things like different colors and everything my daughter loves the variety of the toys and i love the convenience i'm going to buy it for presents for other families i know !	5
0	my son cannot wait to get a bigger set compared to other magnetic building sets geomags is by far better quality although it is also more expensive	5
1	i picked this up on clearance but i still think i spent too much the older versions were made of much sturdier material the cards the questions are printed on are very flimsy compared to the original game the questions are okay but many are very obscure trivial pursuit is a great game and it 's one of my favorites but this version is a dud save your money if you have the older version it 's still a lot more fun to play	5
1	this is very small it 's too small for a play kitchen and you only get one not two like is pictured	5
0	this large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the classic collection children of all ages \( and adults \) can build ships planes houses whatever the mind imagines in a variety of colors the bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage while lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character this is a great product	5
0	i received this promptly and in time for vacation was great for the kids in the car they loved the stencils that came with the board many hours of fun they like that they can make skid marks with the lightning mcqueen car	5
1	we bought these skates for our 5 year old she could barely skate in them they are too big and bulky for children just learning to skate we returned them and have yet to find another pair	5
1	dude this looks cool but plays crappy pretty cheap plastic mechanics are lame you cant really tell when superman is hit because his head barely leans back you have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets and it seems rigged that supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth justice and the american way again cool figures weak cheap playability	5
1	its disgusting that any company would make this figure into a toy complete with knives \? geez give the kid a manuel next time	5
0	i love this kit the puppies are so cute and the project is really fun i loved the finished craft and it gave my children the freedom to creat whatever they wanted would like to buy more of these to make a whole kennel and to give as birthday and holiday gifts all we needed was in the box and the directions were so easy to follow	5
1	we bought this for our kids for christmas of course we open the box on christmas eve at 10pm to put it together and there are no instructions ! it looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them tomorrow morning should be interesting ! merry christmas	5
0	very interesting spoof of the original game i found the first one boring after a few plays but this one still interests my kids and i after 10 plays it 's a bit convoluted to put it together initially but well worth it	5
1	my son and i have had the same experience with this sticker maker great fun for the first 5 10 stickers but then the sticker role jammed and i did not have the opportunity to give the insides a good look before i was desparately trying to remember how it all went back together too bad he loved it while it lasted	5
0	my 8yo dd received this for her bday she loves it it has lots of storage space insde for all her polly pocket goodies it 's also quite sturdy one of the levels got bent the wrong way and i was able to put it back and it still works	5
1	battery is way overpriced contact battery store near you ! i did and found this same exact battery type \( 2 6volt batteries \) for much less while there they told me i could use a low amp 12v deep cycle battery instead it did take some time wiring \( fused link is a must \) but is well worth it lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp trickle charge with a amp selectable car battery charger all told it cost me less than 60 for everything it now longer just takes up space	5
1	this is a very cute set however it 's not very well made and the holders are free standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over in regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you do n't have that problem with kids the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue i would n't buy this set again if i had it to do over disappointing	5
1	we used the machine once and were disappointed by the performance the second time that we attempted to use it it would n't heat after contacting roseart i was told that i could ship it to them at my expense for a replacement i will probably not bother as it was a lousy product to begin with	5
1	my daughter received this as a gift we all found it extremely difficult to use i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand play it is too advanced difficult to use for the ages listed the screen on the monitor was low graphics poor lighting quality as well this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter	5
1	i had purchased two of these smack and yack cars for my grandson while wrapping them the night before i planned to give the gift i discovered that they did not make noise as advertised if i had looked at them earlier i would have returned them for a refund it 's no fun to have grandchildren that are disappointed	5
1	i purchased this item for my son 's birthday not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly after a couple of days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min successful flight on the second day after 15 mins of recharging the battery the battery case and wires melted have contacted company for a refund	5
1	my daughter had this when she was a teenager now my grandchildren come and play the game she had to preserve the original game i ordered new ones to replace my daughters game when she had it the grandchildren all 6 of them love playing this game at our house	5
0	we originally bought this game at the chiricahua national monument in arizona for our kids \( 8 and 10 years old at the time \) and they loved it we love that it 's monopoly but one that creates interest in visiting our national parks	5
1	do not waste your money my son was so excited to get floam he had been asking for it for a very long time finally i gave in and bought it it is like little pellets in green slime it is so wet and slimy that it is not possible to mold it into anything and you ca n't stick it to anything like they show in the commercials because once you thouch it it is hard to get the slimy mess of off your hands it is very messy and impossible to play with the commercials are very misleading	5
0	these dominos are great for the hello kitty lover my six year old loves them do n't be fooled by the picture though the tin is not full if you ask me there are not enough of them in there the tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full i would have rated it five stars if it had been full	5
1	while the kids love it it 's a headache for parents it takes forever to inflate even with an air compressor thanks to many individual air chambers as other reviewers noted it 's best not to leave it outside \( the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage \) but it 's far too big to leave up inside the house not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down i gave ours away	5
0	the test of a toy is if the child loves it this toy was perfect	5
1	i was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side boards which is very dangerous for kids i was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson 's wagon which i purchased for his 2nd birthday he is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off	5
0	this toy is so cool ! i use it all the time with my friend erica you could text message each other and it even takes pictures my parents bought it for me at christmas they were happy because they did not have to pay a phone bill or for minutes ! this toy is so cool ! now i do not have to beg my parents for a real cell phone ! ! ! i highly recomend for any one who is reading this to get this toy !	5
1	pro easy to visualize the numbers on the screen cons the biggest negative draw back is that the keys are not very sensitive you have to push very hard and often multiple times to get a response this is very frustrating the help keys does not help at all do not buy it it is a wasting money	5
1	as soon as i got it out of the box and put the batteries in it did n't work at all my husband checked it out and we noticed that the plastic was out of place and the little motor fell out of it 's place well my husband clicked everything bak in place and the darn thing still would n't work we returned it the next day and got our money back did n't even bother for a replacement because is so flimsy we were afraid of getting another one just like the first one in all it was a great dissapointmen	5
1	very cheaply made my children broke it after only four months the back wall broke off along with the top roof the furniture also broke the people 's hair came off this house was a big mistake i wish i had purchased a different one this house is very cute but not sturdy enough for preschoolers	5
0	great fun for the family or a group setting we 've had hours of fun	5
0	my 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents so we went and bought this toy at target \( and paid 30 09 for it \) he loves it his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time my only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries \? \? \? what are those \? \?	5
1	the cursor is so minute it is difficult to see it makes the game unplayable in most suitable environments design issue could be fixed easily	5
1	yes i 've just bought the videonow color fx and want more pvd 's but they are kinda costly so i want to know is ther a need to buy this item \? can you burn regular dvd 's to a pvd \? and is this going to be a wast of money \? is there any were to buy blank pvd'	5
1	the idea behind this toy is great ours has lived up to its durability claim my husband did not complain about adding songs to it so it could not have been too bad batteries this eats through them like crazy and we used duracell volume the idea of volume control is good but the highest volume is way too low i ca n't even hear anything until i get it to the mid setting my 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones we probably should not have bought this until next year maybe fisher price will have improved it by then	5
0	i was skeptical at first and i am so happy that i got this for my kids i homeschool my children and needed something to keep one of the kids busy while i was working with another this is easy to use fun to play and i like the stories that are available i think you get a great product for a great price	5

1	my son received this figure for his birthday it broke within the first 5 minutes the sign on his chest lights up which is cool but now he has no legs so he certainly ca n't run	5
0	my 9 month old son loves this toy ! it 's easily his favorite toy he 'll gladly do tummy time hitting the piano keys and hitting the dial and characters he has a great time making it go and will now sit up and scoot the car a little his other toys were good for a couple weeks at best this one he only seems to be enjoying more the longer he plays with it the music is not nearly as loud or as annoying as most toys and is actually a little fun well worth the purchase price	5
1	the concept is perfect it is small but fit my bigger 3 year old okay the pedal mechanism is difficult to master but doable the steering is for slight turns not any sharp turns i rated this item 2 stars because the box was obviously opened prior to me receiving it it most likely was a returned item it was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled i fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well the product is very cheaply made but the sound effects and look is perfect for a batman lover i have written to etoys and i will see how they respond my sons loved the car nevertheless	5
1	i bought this gift for my daughter for christmas it does not work at all it sounds like a cheap transistor radio when you attempt to adjust the knobs i 'd like my money back	5
1	this toy is not what i had expected it is n't very durable at all and it 's hard to put together ! i do n't highly recommend it	5
1	unfortunatley i am not very techno savvy i purchased this thinking we could use it on the original hyperscan unit wronge my boys told me otherwise when they opened up the unit and hooked it up this being ben 10 and the original unit being x men did nothing i felt so bad for my son he loves ben 10 and could not even use these cards	5

0	this barbie is better than some of the other new ones but i did`nt see the street style one yet but i don`t know if they are that good by the reviews i am hearing so far i like her outfit typical shop o holic and typical school girls is quite nice and fits her personality she has a locker with basic stuff you take to school with a secret inside her out fit is denim capri`s black jacket matching beret and a tube top with a necklace	5
1	i ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons they were unable to inflate either soccer ball on christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked if there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit i would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready i had to go out and buy new needles the day after christmas we 'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump	5
1	i bought this vehicle for my son we have been through 2 already they do not work the controller is not made very well the two cars we bought did not respond the first one you had to put the controller right up to the car to make it work the other car would only go forward and we tried this with brand new batteries and the charger pack we bought definitely a disappointment	5
1	these rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition however the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see after we opened the cards \( two sets were purchased \) we found that the rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside down the cards are also not particularly sturdy these cards appear to be irregulars	5
0	i bought my son this toy after reading all the bad reviews i agree that you cant reach all the buttons in the time allocated but he loves it and watches it move round the room i recommend this product for 9 month olds	5
0	this game is so much fun ! ! ! i do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels in other words if you are a huge star wars fan like me then you will love this game ! ! ! it will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level another thing i think it could use is maybe a game save function or something anyway great gaming experience ! ! ! one and a half thumbs up ! ! !	5
0	yesterday we where buying the christmass presents when i saw there was the big air towel at 40 bucks so i said to my mother if i could buy so she said yes when i got home i began building it after 6 hours i finished it and when i tried everything was going all right so it was n't that difficult	5
0	we absolutely love this wagon ! my 2yr old will ride as long as i want to walk stop detour whatever she 's glued ! it is huge on the heavy side but also huge \( you can carry so much many children \) w great quality durability i can easily see us w this wagon for years to come would suggest it to anyone comparing	5
0	toby is one of the regulars on the thomas his friends tv series and this little wooden tram engine is well made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets my only complaint and this is very minor is that toby is a bit taller than other wooden thomas engines meaning that he cannot fit under bridges very well	5
0	i agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen my daughter loved it when she was 1 now she 's turned 2 and she 's lost interest in it like many other baby toys i had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can cook with it	5
0	this is a nice toy for kids to ride on my daughter loves the little horn there are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music that does not work well at all there are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either it 's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features do n't work well worth the buy if a family is really into the john deere theme	5
0	we bought the leappad plus for our 4 year old for christmas and 4 books to go along with it then i realized we had no where to put it we also bought the littletouch leadpad for our 1 year old and a bunch of books yesterday we went and bought this and the carry case for our little one 's littletouch great space saver it is made very well too our daughter calls it her briefcase it fits everything perfectly	5
1	i was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway it was a lot of fun ! while it worked we experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here i appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to \? it 's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it i would not buy it again if you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first	5
1	my son waited 8 hours to play with his lighning mcqueen only to be disappointed this thing is way to expense to only jerk around my kitchen floor ! my only hope is i can return this dumpy car because my son tore into the box with excitement ! shame on disney do not buy	5
1	i was very excited about this game until it came out of the box it looks great for my 3 year old but as in other reviews the spinner ruins the entire game this should have been obvious at design and this game should never have made it to stores with this defect it is particularly frustrating because the concept seems so good with a lot of thought put into the educational value i think ill will is going to be the result of this penny minding in construction leapfrog could have further enhanced the brand with this product but fumbled	5
1	i purchased this for my daughters 2nd birthday withing the first 5 minutes the back of the chair part for the high chair had broken off and would not stay on the first time she went to take it in the bath pooh 's arm came off and will not go back on i am just really disappointed that it was n't anything as great as i thought it would be i saw the it in the store and was excited that my daughter would love it but sadly it was very depressing for both of us	5
0	if you are not a literature professor or do n't read everything that the library gets in you will probably find this game extremely difficult on the other hand you now have a book list	5

0	my almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy it is easy for her to control my 8 year old thinks it is boring i do n't think it has any educational value the controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it	5
1	to anyone who buys this toy keep the box and receipt handy we may be the odd one out but we purchased this toy and it did n't work the legs on manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball this did n't happen rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces 'rapid fire' and if we were lucky one would shoot out after great effort it comes with three foam balls two of which fit the third was slightly too big and would jam ours is going back to the store today	5
0	easy to follow instructions for set up and play very intuitive the only thing i would suggest is to make sure the young folks have an 'elder' playing on their team to have a shot at the questions on old people events etc if they 're real sports history buffs then it 's not an issue	5
0	i just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls \( 3 and 5 \) with it today it does blow tons of bubbles ! they love chasing them all over the yard the gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out it does used 8 aa batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor yes it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you do n't use so many batteries where i 'll plug it in in the backyard i'm not sure yet i definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles	5
1	i ordered this item and was so excited it loaded fine it let me upload files just fine it was n't until i actually tried to create my pvd that i received errors that shut down the program \( many many many times with numerous types of video files \) i double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine the worst thing is that there is no support for the media player i tried contacting hasbro with no response i am so dissapointed	5
0	we are huge blues clues fans and this is our favorite blue ever ! his is really big and sooooo soft ! this buddy is much more cozy than the smaller beanie baby version he is a great cuddly no frills \( no buttons to push or batteries to replace \) buddy ! my toddler sons love this blue	5
1	very dangerous ! my daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike the handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over there is only one good thing about it the seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going this helped my daughter learn to pedal the constant nose dive however was not worth it do n't buy !	5
0	an unexciting piece of value only to the completist collector \( like myself \) there 's nothing wrong with it it 's just that there 's nothing great about it either the lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a holographic figure hasbro could has done better by choosing another host sculpt to base this exclusive off of the phantom menace version was much better	5
1	purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers wanting to check out what i purchased i opened one of the five the geodes are tiny \( not as pictured \) it was like breaking open dirt clods that have a small empty space inside but not crystals maybe it was a dud box but will probably be returning the other four	5
0	i probably play over a hundred games of solitaire a night i have a hard time sleeping but this game after playing as many as i do makes me go to sleep i have n't read a book in over two months which to me is remarkable because i have read at night ever since junior high i am now 62 and playing solitaire thank goodness for it	5
0	this game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations the luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn all in all this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it	5
1	i purchased this car for my 2 year old son for christmas shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to christmas morning the car lights up and makes sounds \( very annoying \) but did n't move an inch i replaced all batteries still no movement the manufacturer was of no help thank god someone else also got him the chicco remote control car because it works ! steer clear of this stinker	5
0	this is a must have for your little sweetheart ! my daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes it 's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next \) the accessories are cute but she 'd rather use stuff from mommy 's purse \) the purse is oh so cute too and durable my daughter is 21 months old she received this on christmas and has been a favorite since	5
1	my one year old and i love these blocks they are light soft and provide endless opportunity for imagination however they are extremely expensive and of inferior quality construction when we opened the box we found that several of the blocks were not cut along a straight edge making them difficult to stack also several of the identical shape blocks were not exactly the same size leading to stacking problems one of the blocks was peeling in one corner these blocks are such a great idea i find it hard to believe no other companies are making them	5
0	this angel is sure to be a gem in any collectors collection she is elegant and graceful her gown in beautiful as well as her spiral curled hair she is adorned in a golden head chain she has a chain sash which is also part of her gown at last she is given beautiful golden wings and holds a bouquet of flowers this one will definately be worth the value in the years to come	5
1	the item arrived to us the week of christmas three weeks after we had ordered it it arrived with several broken and several missing parts amazon would not send us new parts they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first this was to be a christmas gift to my son so that was not optional had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would i would have had time to return it	5
0	and still loves it 7 months later ! he even takes it camping and plays for hours outside with it we are getting him more his dad likes to get in on it too	5
1	bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra parts but the surprise here is the complicity of amazon in this misleading packaging this is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found they know they made a mistake if only they would contact us each now for a full refund i wish a rep from amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger i wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for his big gift	5
0	my 3 1 2 year old son has older sisters with ipods and always wants to use them to listen to we bought this for him for christmas and he calls it his ipod and he absolutely loves it we download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward we also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home it 's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out	5

0	anything leappad is great its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet my son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of leappad at 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly i highly recommend this and any other leap pad book and toy most schools have dropped phonics from the classrooms and leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love	5

0	the lego community workers set met our expectations and even more the set comes with lots of different pieces and has made our lego experience very fun albeit a little on the expensive side this set is well worth it	5
0	i love this motorcycle and it is a no duh that it does n't run on fuel really think what fuel are you going to use plus fuel is hazardous to children and a company would n't threaten the lives of innocent children ! that 's my opinion	5

0	i enjoy seeing my twin four year old son 's play with the read with me dvd program and cd 's the children are learning as they play i see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story this educational toy is very engaging the only problem i have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the dvd player it takes several tries to get the dvd player to respond to the remote	5
1	i do n't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy i agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4 year old daughter ! also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time all that being said she loves it	5
0	these are really cute and a great alternative to the standard numbers and letters version of these foam tub toys my 2 and 3 year old sons enjoy playing with them no complaints here	5
0	my daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it it combines the classic board and memory games together the pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable the only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily we have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box an excellent game ! !	5
1	my 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times our version did not include the 5 ways to play as stated on the box \( i 've requested a copy from briarpatch \) my 4 year old who received the gift lost interest after the first time he played both of my boys love the i spy and can you see what i see books this game just was n't challenging enough for them	5
0	this is a great puzzle ! my son is 2 1 2 and wants to put it together almost every day ! it is amazing to watch him because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor to do this together he can do it more and more on his own ! and when we are done he is so proud of himself i love it ! i am online right now looking for more just like it	5
0	i bought the sea monkeys on mars for my 7 year old son he loves them they hatched easily grew quickly and are quite cute he loves to feed them and watch them swim they are eductational and fun	5

1	we bought this for our 3 year old daughter for christmas we turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out we thought it was just a case of dead batteries so we replaced the batteries several times until we realized the product was just bad when trying to get it replaced we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead needless to say our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere ever we 'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music	5
0	got this as a fun birthday present for my husband who adores anything star wars he liked it so much he brought it to work and we now occassionally hear stories about darth potato and the spud troopers waging war on unsuspecting engineers it 's a great geek toy	5
1	the stars may be really nice but the package i received looked already open the 3 sheets with stickers appeared as if someone soaked them in water and the package was missing the putty to stick up the bigger plastic stars	5

0	everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic darth vader mask we bought it initially for my son who is darth vader obsessed but it 's quickly become the house favorite \( even grandpa ca n't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be darth for a spell \) on another note we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece it is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display	5
0	this product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the uk as a great teaching tool it was well received as a gift by the children and their parents an excellent math teaching tool that the children love it is portable user friendly and has something for those on many different levels so much so that one father an engineer loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son as well as a game that they can play together math whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge	5
0	this game is fun for the family it 's very simple and can be played by young children learning to count it 's not overly exciting by itself but you can make it that way with your own spin on sound effects	5
1	what on earth are you thinking \? nobody is going to pay that much for this game unless it has a portal to the deminsion of toyland	5
1	we bought this for our son for christmas this year based on glowing reviews what a disappointment ! the musical instruments are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same the song the drum plays is tinny scratchy and short and nothing seems very well made i at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another on the plus side it is cute and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound	5
0	my son is 4 1 2 and he loved the set he and his dad set it up on christmas and enjoyed ringing the bell i would recommend this for kids any age	5

0	love this game with family and or friends it 's one of the best card games around it is easy and does n't require a lot of attention \( you can watch movies talk hang out etc \) yet keeps your interest it 's also a game people of many ages can play because it 's not too difficult a good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame	5
1	we were so excited to order this item sadly the quality is very poor we have had it set up for less than a week and the front counter has broken off and one of the front panels has had a leg rip off my kids love the idea of this item but it is extremely flimsy particle type board it has basically disintergrated berfore our eyes even with general play it sways back and forth a little scary if little ones are playing in it i am going to call the maker hopefully we can repair this \(	5
1	as you can see by other posts we were all duped by a misleading advertisement it still shows realistic tail movement in the listing hello ! ! ! what tail \? ! \? ! \? ! \? ! \? they have since changed the picture to the doll we all received the original picture showed the swimming one \( tail attached \) my daughter was absolutely heartbroken when she opened this and realized this doll has no tail nor does she swim i fully expect to be allowed to return this thing \( opened \) at no cost to myself	5

1	even though yugioh is dead this is my favorite pack \( even though i don t get them any more \) the deck that i made is an archfiend deck which can kill you if you do n't have a spell card on the field that says you do n't have to pay life points for archfiend cards they are also one of the strongest group if cards there is terrorking archfiend infernalqueen archfiend archfiend solder and others even though yugioh is dead some people still play ot and some stores but them from you i sold my deck for you should too	5

0	our whole family loves this game i like this version because it includes the history and rules of the game on the inside cover i also like that you can close the cover and not lose the dice the construction is a little flimsy and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice rolling a little noisy we added a piece of felt on top of the board and it is much better	5
0	being a preschool teacher i use these all of the time i have found that taking the sheets out individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way to work with them even if you do n't have an easel these are wonderful for children of all ages large unlined sheets of paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves in a completely original way for infants toddlers and preschoolers i will often tape the sheets to the table and let them color paint glue to their hearts delight	5
1	i helped my five year old assemble this and like most lego directions it went together well unfortunately it does n't stay together when he tries to play with it the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle not as easy to put back together once it 's come apart it 's proven a real disappointment	5

1	i bought this for my son 's birthday last night since he is interested in music as i was wrapping it i noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position i took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place wondering how many times i was going to have to do this i decided to test it once i fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys \( you can even see through them \) the dollar store has better toys than this the sound is horrible and uncontrollable the controls are worthless i'm returning it today and good riddance	5
0	i bought this doll w brunette hair for my 4 year old it 's so soft and realistic looking floppy like a real newborn perfect weight for little ones to cradle i 'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w long hair some of the other co 's make them too heavy not conducive for real play this doll is also washable a big plus the hair is soft and very brushable the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly a little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features overall a very nice doll high quality hopefully will be played w for many years	5

1	my daughter really wanted the cloud kingdom for christmas as soon as i saw the quality of it i should have returned it but i knew it would break her heart it takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most barbie houses my daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together so she hardly plays with it this toy is definately not worth the money i wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy	5
0	my daughter purchased this with christmas money and it did not work at all we reported this to amazon and they took care of immediately i was very impressed ! now we have a new toy that she loves that works great it is fun to play with and a storage container when she 's finished	5

1	i bought this kit solely for the prism to show my kids how the light split into a rainbow the prism is such poor quality plastic that the light does n't even go through it correctly i could have made a better prism in my oven with plastic pellets and a form the sides look like a cake top that fell causing the light to not go through it correctly the rest of the kit sucks too i put batteries in the flashlight and the plastic of the flashlight cracked and crumbled in my hand ! the cardboard cutouts are ok if you want to pay lots of bucks for cardboard cutouts and the included soda straw	5

1	am totally dissatisfied with ths wagon as it came dented the wagon is shipped in a cardboard box with no styrofoam or other packing the wagon bed absorbs any impacts the parts are in the bed and there is cardboard to prevent scratching there were no scratches and the finsih was nice the pacaging is totally inadequate i would return the wagon if time permitted i am glad that i am not giving it to a child as a gift buy it where you can look it over first to be sure it 's not damaged	5
1	i did n't know you had to line up the arrows on the motor part so we installed it incorrectly and it rotated counterclockwise my husband took the whole thing apart and reversed the battery terminals so that it would turn clockwise then it worked just fine the instructions do n't mention that you have to align the motor to the terminals in a certain fashion or it will turn backwards but once you get it lined up right it works fine with hershey 's syrup a great starter fountain for my chocaholic 2nd grader	5
0	my daughter is 2 1 2 years old and i often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing after dinner i find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine she has learned how to button use a zipper and problem solve by using this book also i find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible i have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it	5
0	i bought this toy because amamzon 's price was a great bargin compared to other stores i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way there is a lot more room for more logs 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front i ended up buying additional logs \( not lincoln logs \) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence	5
0	i think this a great item for a child over 3 1 2 since there are 4 puzzles in one box our son who just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate they are symbol coded on the back so i think once he gets older it will get easier he loves the pictures and i love that the pieces are sturdy and how much he is learning highly recommnde	5
1	we were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday after opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied however the screen is very disappointing i ca n't even rate the games because overall i simply just ca n't see what is on it the product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing i should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products i would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it	5
1	a one star rating for this toy is way to charitable the car does nothing but jerk and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy ! surely they had to have an idea about their product 's poor performance my advice is everyone should print off the reviews from amazon and all like it with this in hand march into disney stores and demand \( 1 \) their money back \( 2 \) an apology the only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 gmc jimmy	5
0	our son plays with this board while i'm feeding him he 's only 20 months but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him it 's well built arrived in only a couple days our son loves it !	5
0	my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles they 're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles it 's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but are n't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles there 's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge the only downside are some of the very small pieces definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3	5
0	my son got this toy for his first birthday he 's now 18 months and still loves it ! when he first got it he immediately began to dance to the music you can press certain body parts on ernie and then he sings about them \( i e eyes mouth ears \) my son can now identify his ears mouth and eyes on himself great toy	5
0	we gave our nine yr old grandson this train for christmas he had a such a good time putting it together then running it on the track the train absolutely glides on the track so quietly and smoothly it is a great product	5
1	my twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3 they loved it ! ! ! the dog is so cuddly and cute they loved playing pretend with the accessories my only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off the syringe was coming apart and the brush had lost a couple of bristles the boys had not played rough with it it just was n't the quality that i had hoped for it is a real favorite of theirs i am just afraid that it wo n't last as long as their imaginations i think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy a real winner for young children in the hospital	5

0	my 6 year old loves this toy she made all 3 bears at one time my husband helped her they are well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special tool so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and re stuff them	5
0	we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is we have mixed feelings about her my daughter 4 loves her hair because it 's so different from all her other barbies but she hates her feet her feet are way too big even bigger than ken 's \( my daughter tried making her wear ken 's shoes but it did n't work \) another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge \( good \) and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls \( bad because she ca n't use the other doll 's clothes \)	5
1	fisher price is selling the same item for only 33 139 99 has to be a mistake	5
1	this was a cute product but only lasted a day perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag a patch was included but it seems that air is leaking from the seams oh well	5
1	my 3 year old got this for a christmas gift and i thought it to be a great idea since he loves elmo and bathtime wrong the darn crayons stained my bathtub ! ! i had to scrub my tub for what seemed like forever to get the stains almost out i threw the crayons away after that my son likes the elmo still but i would n't recommend the crayons especially in an older style porcelain bathtub like ours	5

0	we recently purchased this toy storage unit for our 22 month old son and we could n't be happier it is sturdy and durable a hard combination to find these days looks great but most of all is very functional and user friendly ! ! it only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks great our son ca n't wait to get up and play yelling toy box and jumping out of bed to grab a bin i will purchase more of these for the different toy areas of our home and would certainly give it as a gift	5

0	the lifehammer is a good product a bit small but i have seen tests on mythbusters \( discovery channel \) and it seems to work just fine i purchased two different type hammers in the same transaction and was charged two different shipping fees from two different vendors which seems innefficient to me if i could find this product in a brick and mortar store i would have purchased it there	6
0	works great everyone needs this tire gauge it is easy to use and easy to read	6
0	my husband recently installed this in his car and loves it it was a fairly simple installation and works just as promised	6

0	i have an older version of this charger that i bought in the mid 90 's i used it to maintain my garaged mustang 's battery over the winter months for many years i made a cigarette lighter adapter so all i needed to do was to plug it in instead of using the alligator clips i have to say this thing is dead reliable ! it always kept my battery in prime condition i love it and recommend it highly	6
0	great product used it for 5 years now limit the streaking by two ways using a spray bottle lightly mist a paper towel then buff the glass after product dries after streaks are detected just use a dry cotton cloth \( towel \) and buff the streaks out not that difficult to have streak free glass but the streaks will be annoying during night time traveling	6
1	if you have tinted windows this product does not work	6
0	my wife wanted something like this to feel safer in the car not only does it break the glass it also has a seatbelt cutter	6
0	the negative reviews of this thing most fall under that category of it took too long well that would be because you did n't let the oil warm up before trying to suck it through a thin piece of tubing idiot if you follow the directions this thing works great 5 stars i would buy it again in a heartbeat	6
1	i bought this item and i literally hate it they make it seem so simple and easy but the blade does not do a good job in removing water from car surfaces i would only recommend it for doing windows much easier to use chamois or regular old terrycloth towels	6
0	this device has saved my old car from a non start once and given me peace of mind continuously since i purchased it one note the green charged light never goes on the first time it is charged but will after it 's been charged used at least once and charged again it seems to need to learn what the full charge is before it can register properly	6
0	i knew we needed this thing with 7 people crammed in a van but i'm short so i was leary no problem it saved our travel experience and wore very well easy to work with well worth the price which was n't bad to begin with	6
0	i bought this reader when my engine light came on turns out i could fix the problem myself with a 15 dollar part the dealership was going to charge me over 100	6
0	it works great and never falls down my dog isnt too rough with it and im not sure if she was if it would still stay up but it does what i needed it to do keep her from sitting on my brand new car seats	6

0	it is really very nice and my colleague would like to buy that too they made my car looks very comfortable	6
0	while my wife refuses to put it on her white van she loves it and even i get a kick out of it	6
1	this product was purchased as a christmas gift for my father unfortunately it did not perform for him i was replacing this with one that he has had for over 10 years and that one still works and outperfomed this brand new model i am not sure if we just got a defective one but i dont recommend purchasing although i have to say returning to amazon was straightforward they just simply refunded my money i will inturn buy my dad something else from amazon you just cant beat the service	6
0	if were a celebrity i would endorse it on tv it sweeps my car hood windows roof trunk lid and headlights beautifully ! the scraper is fierce and lets ice on the window know who s boss ! me that s who with my long reach red handled blizzard model 3512 snowbrush and scraper thanks hoppy !	6
0	i have a 2005 ford ranger i bought this unit and fully read the instructions before starting the install after that i began searching for the right connecitons on the steering column and connected up the unit i went online to find the correct placement of the wires and downloaded a printout the unit installed well worked fine after initialization came with a video that really helped in the installation i find the range on this unit to be super i have no complaints	6
0	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness but that aside it works well right on the money easy to use bright colors easy to find the price is about right no real bargain at less than 6 each but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each no regrets	6
1	this car seat cushion 's foam padding is not only paper thin but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts \( i'm not kidding \) placed in some of the cushion 's massaging bubbles this makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine ! i threw my massage cushion into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing	6
0	read out my obdii error code with a one line description and allowed me to reset it no problem	6
1	i received these seat covers as a birthday gift and one of them did rip at the seam \( also shortly after they were installed \) i came on here to order another and after reading that someone else had the same problem i know not to waste my money they are very unique and i do like the looks of them but only wish they were better quality	6
1	we were expecting more of a cushion feel to this seat but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving it would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe but for a cushion its flat and cheap feeling as for king size it barely covers our car 's seat we ended up returning them not worth it	6
0	i installed this in my mazda3 5 door wagon the day it arrived \( which was very fast i might add \) it fit perfectly the height of the barrier was just low enough to fit in my wagon so it did n't require a lot of adjusting that way the bars slide out on the sides to fit the width of the wagon nicely i 've had my three boston terriers back there numerous times now no escaping possible ! i had looked through different pet stores for a barrier like this but they were 3 times the price ! this is a great deal	6
1	bought 2 of these both failed at extactly the same time after a few months save your money	6
0	you have to be very careful how you apply this product the instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution only then will it work if you use too much you will experience the oil and water effect the other rater stated otherwise this product works very well remember to reapply when you see the effects going away	6
0	my trusty ford escort experienced cold shock when moved from tx to pa in december it needed to be jump started the jump starter has been extremely easy and effective to use	6
0	ths is exactly what i needed i have so many 12volt dc products i need connected at the same time and this definetly helps i like thati can mount it where i need to and there is a good sized cord that comes with it the built in led power usage indicator lights are nice especially if you have your engine off and your woried about your batter if it goes from green to orange start your vehicle and you wo n't have to worry if your battery is going to die	6
1	this is the worst smelling freshener i have ever used its just a terrible smell like the other reviewer said its very chemical in nature i sprayed som in my living room to see what it was like and wow i opened the windoes pretty quick i could not imagine this in a hot car i picked it up for 1 50 at a biglots and i feel ripped off dont buy it	6
1	i have had 2 faulty units right out of the box the first would not hold a charge for more than a couple of days and that did not improve after cycling the battery a number of times i returned it for a replacement and that 2nd unit never indicated a full charge even after being on charge for several days i am moving on to another brand do n't waste your time and money on these poor quality items	6
0	i use meguiar 's supreme shine microfiber to dry my car after i wash it there 's no lint and it gives my car an incredible shine it 's also great for windows as well i will only use this product from now on	6
1	this item performed as expected reads and resets fault codes in all vehicles with obd ii connector easy to use only 2 buttons ! you might be able to find it 10 cheaper at a local store on sale but even at the price i paid it was a bargain ! cost of tool 1 diagnostic visit to local shop	6
0	i 've used this product for the last 10 years i keep one in my trunk at all times the fix a flat will work on small holes the size of nails shake it hard then add it to the tire like an air hose the tire will inflat enough for you to drive it to a local gas station for air	6
0	very nice kit and bag only drawback is that it does n't have flares	6
1	this obdii reader is way too simple does n't really do much in diagnostic could not reset anything save up and buy a bit more better unit	6
1	the seat covers are cute but only 1 comes in a box and while i was putting them in my car one of them ripped ! obviously the quality is not very good	6
0	the dash of my black car is anthracite gray and it shows dust easily the california duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax this picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior picking it all up in one swipe i keep this in the car and once a week i swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean it 's small enough to keep handy under the seat this makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car or for someone who likes doing their own detailing	6
0	the laser parking system works great ! it took me 5 minutes to install and now my wife can park her way oversized suv in our garage with little problem no kidding there is 1 inch to spare in the front before she hits the shelves and 3 inches in the back so the garage door can close with the laser she hits the mark everytime	6
0	i got these as a gift and my mother n law loved them	6
0	i 've loved this product since i first got some from my dad in many years ago forget the car i use it in my bathroom ! stepping out of a shower and being able to see in the mirror is great no more trying to blow dry the mirror or wiping with a towel only to leave behind wet streaks and having the mirror re fog again this is the greatest i almost thought they stopped making it because i could n't find it in the last 2 automotive stores i visited \( it came bundled with the regular rain x for windshields also good \) but now that i see it on line i know i can buy it again	6
0	small but reliable it helps me to save gas and tires thanks for it	6
1	i bought two pair in different sizes and one pair was great but the other pair had deteriorated edges that left water in lines from the first use and one lock did n't secure the blade to the arm well i had to buy a replacement immediately	6
0	been waiting for my parts supplier to carry this item for a while seen it on audis and other german cars for a while and adverts on various car mags etc if your thinking think no more buy it !	6
0	pros inexpensive compact and thoughtfully designed cons no dc adapter although there is a hole for an ad on connector no power cord and you need an extension cord to to fit in the recessed a c port recommend yes ! paid 19 00 on summer closeoutcomments i bought this to jump start my 1 ton dodge rv after winter storage i 've jumpped my 1997 gmc suburban and various other cars trucks and it performed flawlessly and i live in an area where sub zero temps are the norm during fall and winter it is not a flashlight warning light battery charger air compressor or dc converter ! but it is a decent jump starter at an affordable price !	6
0	seems that amazon does n't want to sell this item because they do n't tell the most important thing about it that is that it 's a 0 60 psi gauge to be used for tires needing about 30 psi give or take 10 the illustration is incorrect but they show the same picture for all the different moroso gauges i measured accuracy against a digital and it 's within 5 psi best thing is that it makes a perfect and instant seal with the tire put a little extra air in press the button and it 's an accurate fill i think the rubber cover is a must amazon 's is the best price	6
0	this is an awsome peice of work the person who thought of this is a genious and i would like to thank him her because i have perchased this product and it has lasted a long time all the other ones that i have bought have broken in a weeks period of time	6
1	when the factory charged batteries ran out the solar panel would not charge the light this was a fluorescent version the replacement unit quickly sent by amazon was led the same case and everything but with bright leds inside i liked it much better than the fluorescent one the second unit charged and worked very well until the charge was depleted then the leds would start blinking like an emergency light sunforce said that this was not normal behavior i returned it as well the light will stay up for around two hours charge quickly but the blinking made it unfit for continuous use a nice product but quallity needs to be improved	6
0	i got the item quickly it installed easily and when it rains it removes water from the windshield which is what i expected it to do no complaints	6
0	it 's what i will need if the car battery is drained i hope i never have to use it	6
0	this is a great battery charger that you need if you have a boat and trolling motor high quality and easy to use	6
1	this product is not worth the money it does not keep the car cool and was a waste of my money beware of products that only make money for the inventor	6
0	i am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000 mile tour from nebraska to florida with this on the top of my subaru and i must say it was great thing to have everything stayed bone dry and secure but i would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure plenty of room and solid construction for the price it ca n't be beat	6
0	has the power to get you back on the road when the battery fails i am sure it does more but at this time that is all that has been asked	6
0	i did n't realize this item would be as well made as it is great paint job too ! my 9 yr old daughter loves it good christmas gift stocking stuffer	6
0	i have been using this cleaner since my brother worked for a car detailer about 10 years ago and discovered it it is the best for glass truly streak free it is awesome on stainless steel tile painted wood sealed varnished wood porcelain and more i use it for everything i'm showing a house right now and this stuff is perfect for keeping things sparkling with minimum effort \( though you should see my paper towel budget lol	6
1	advanced security is all a lie these locks can be easily opened without a key i have written to the masterlock company and they replaced the lock free of charge to a one that uses a regular key	6
1	the description of this product is not accurate these lights are not bright i have 6 mounted under the cabinets in my very small kitchen and all 6 on at once add up to the equivalent of a night light it is a pretty color of light but very dim	6
0	the helmet fits snug on my head no complaints about its styling there is only one complaint i purchased this helmet because i heard the horror stories of people saying there helmet would fog up this helmet stated that it was an anti fog helmet not true i still have to pull the shield up or pull the helmet up other than that its a great helmet	6
0	these ramps work well with my lowrider saturn i can get up on them without scraping the spoiler extremely light a major improvement over the old metal ramps i used as a kid	6
0	excellent little assortment of parts here it 's not for everyone but for those who can take advantage of it it 's a nice ensemble all the hardware is of decent quality and appears durable many of the parts would be hard to get for half the price i bought it at a discount price and really had very little trouble seeing high value in it even at the regular price you would be hard pressed to duplicate it for double	6
0	for ease of use the deltran battery tender is an excellent way to charge and maintain the battery on your motorcycle snowmobile or even a heavy duty vibrator not that i would know anything about that ! the kit includes a bmw type plug for machines so equipped and an sae adaptor with alligator clips you can also wire the sae adaptor right to your bike 's battery and have easy access to the plug in the battery is maintained in a peak state of charge with no worries of over charging	6
0	we purchased this item to travel to the mountains for christmas we drove 7 1 2 hours in the pooring rain our luggage stayed completely dry it easily attached to our mini van luggage rack and stayed secured the duration of the trip this bag is awesome and reasonably priced !	6
0	saved me twice so far tow rope got me out of a snow bank has almost everything you need some things are kind of cheap but in general the product gets the job done	6
0	this is a fine product the 3 led bulbs pack a vast amount of illumination i ordered 4 of them and have no problem lighting up my whole livingroom i left 1 unit on for over 6 hours and its was still burning brightly when i chose to shut it off you will not be disappointed with these awsome	6
0	this is a much nicer seat cover than i imagined it would be \( especially for the cost \) the only complaint i have is that with it in place i ca n't extend my head rest \( i'm tall \) but other than that it 's very comfortable and protects the car seat under it very well i wear suspenders and without something to protect the seat the car seat gets cut by the buckles	6
0	i just used this product to wash my car and it worked great as it is advertised a little goes a long ways \( 1 oz per gallon \) the suds feel very smooth and lifted dirt off my car with easy it is also easy to rinse off and after washing my car 's surface felt slick as well	6
1	i work in an auto shop and this thing is a joke with the money that you pay for a filter and 5 qts of oil you can get it done by a professional that will buy you a new engine if it blows up will this company stand by its product like that \? i doubt it for a few extra bucks you can get an oil flush if you 're worried about gunk it 's a scam	6
0	this product works well and saved me lots of money it is easy to use	6
0	very nice product holds lots of things especially able to put full size pieces of paper in a zippered compartment which is very useful for me	6
1	as other reviewers mentioned the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings it may be accurate but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several minute guessing and waiting game calling it a racing gauge is ridiculous	6
0	this seat supportsyour back and keeps you cooler in summer been using these type of seats for a decade and plan to continue using this type as long as they are availabl	6
0	i recieved the mr clean auto dry system for fathers day im usually skeptical about products that are new to the market place and one with the incredible claim that this product makes that it will give a spot free shine without using a towel well quite frankly i was very skeptical about this products claim i used it today and was very impressed it took about 10 15 minutes to dry but when it did my beautiful silver car looked better than when i used a shamois it was very easy and it saved me the elbow work and the 20 minutes i would have spent drying the car i am a big fan of the auto dry system and will never towell dry again	6
0	the mothers powerball mini powerball are outstanding recommend it to all car collectors we just loved the way it works and the time it cuts down to polish crome wheels used the big ball on the pro street wheels and the mini on the front we 'd still be polishing if it was n't for the mothers products great buy	6
0	i bought a pair of powerballs i used one yesterday it performed just as advertised my drill and the powerball did all the work for me wiping the residue off was no problem it 's a great time saver i highly recommend the poweball to anyone who 's a fanatic about their wheels	6
0	i purchased this item for my father it has definitely paid for itself ! just a heads up for those planning to purchase this item the scanner itself is cp9145 not cp9150 i had 2 of these delivered and thought i was sent the wrong product each time according to the manufacturer a cp9150 is a cp9145 with extra cables included which allow you to test a greater selection of vehicles hope this helps	6
0	best item i ever bought no more over or under charging with a stupid trickle charger ever ! ! !	6
0	the desert gets really dusty so having this product to swipe over my car \( especially windows \) helps me save money on car washes i wish the package had included a bigger cover to store the brush in it 's awkward putting it back into the same cover it came in once you start accumulating dirt	6
0	i use this in my car while driving it takes pressure of your tailbone which can reduce back pain \( if you have lower back issues \) i really recommend this prodcut both for its function and its price	6
0	this windshield shade was exactly what i was looking for and has provided an easy and effected way to shade my cars windshield by blocking the sun and reducing the temperature in my car on hot days	6
0	great for cars that no longer install ashtrays example honda traps all odor once you get the hang of how it opens and closes it 's also easy to use at night i do n't think it 's a great ashtray but a great disposal system if a ld light was installed it would be even better for nightime use	6
0	purchased as a just in case and i hope i'm never in a situation where i will need to use it but at least i feel safer knowing it 's there i 've only tested this on pieces of wood and plexiglass and it works as it should this tool was also highlighted on an episode of mythbusters on the discovery channel in a submerged car myth they demonstrated how a tool just like this one and the lifehammer both worked perfectly on the side window of a submerged car so i'm sold on this tool 's ability	6
0	the same with the frog bucket seatcover very nice staff for just 15 bucks	6
0	i bought one today for my mazda tribute because i did n't like the built in cup holders it 's actually very sturdy and fits very well	6
0	i received this item in great condition ! will order from you again in the near future thanks	6
0	if you wash your car yourself you should have this once you have the blade you only need one small towel for drying edges the blade does all the work for you it 's fabulous my neighbor who washes his car weekly has one and i saw him use it and was amazed at how well it worked he said he has owned a blade for years and gives them as gifts then i saw another neighbor using one i gave them to my husband and adult sons and they love them my eight year old also thinks it is now fun to wash the car that is priceless	6
0	i have a 06 corvette and 05 explorer and i use the ramps for both vehicles oil changes they work well and seem safe and strong \( you should always use jack stands as an additional safety measure \) with the vette the ramps touch the front air dam but cause no damage \( if you are worried about it rubbing you could use two 1x4 's in front of the ramps for additional clearance \) the ramps are about 6 25 inches tall where the tire sits and there is plenty of room for me \( 250lbs \) under the vette nice product	6
0	this little gizmo really does work it seems to be pretty accurate too although it 's tough to tell you need to give it a good strong blow to get enough air through the little opening to get a good reading i 've tried using a straw to direct the air better and that seems to work unfortunately there 's no sensor that lets you know when it has enough air to take a reading if there 's not enough it just stays green even if there is alcohol present in your breath still for the price it 's pretty darned impressive you 'll need to experiment a bit because the instructions are n't very accurate	6
0	a wonderful kit to have in case of an emergency situation all that it lacks it a cellphone	6
0	works well it operates a bit slowly but i assume that they all do this is not a problem and would not prevent me from purchasing it again a significant advantage of this unit is that the fluid can be evacuated from the unit w o having to pour it out others require opening the resevoir and pouring the fluid out this is useful when dealing w motor oil or other fluids that can be messy i am satisfied and would purchase it again	6
0	with all clear coat finishes on modern automobiles the finish may look pretty good even when then outer layer is beginning to deteriorate so waxing is still important i recommend a fresh application of polish twice per year for maximum protection i have been following cosumers reports recommedations three years ago their recommendation was nufinish liquid this year cr recommneds black magic liquid automobile polish the liquids are easy to apply and seem to last at least as long as the paste waxes in my opinion the black magic is at least as good as the rest i like the cherry scent	6
1	does not work \( cool the interior of the vehicle \) barely at all compared to the ads so false advertising i purchased 2 and one also broke right away very cheaply made product also would never purchase again nor recommend to anyone	6
0	these seat covers are adorable so much better than the picture the frogs are tightly stuffed and appear real sturdy sitting up on the seat top the covers are dark green velvet like and rich looking better than any in the stores	6
0	works just as advertised but requires a bit more light than just sticking it on the outside of the light cover by tucking it under the cover you get a nice bright blinking dot no batteries no outlet no transformer brick	6
1	i 'd give this a zero if allowed easily leaks from both twist caps any money i saved by changing my oil was spent on degreaser and paper towels cleaning my garage floor	6
0	what can i say \? mothers makes great stuff for auto care and this is one of them just make sure you read the instructions and do it right also this is not going to raise any death from its grave it the wheel is pretty busted it may just not have hope	6
0	the super duster has been very efficient in removing dust off my new 2005 camry xle and keeping her shiny between washes along with trimming car wash expenses the full knitting minimizes twists of the wrist inherent with one sided dusters to keep upright i recommend this product most highly paul everett vinsonsan antonio t	6
0	this little machine is capable of pulling so much current that it would blow most fuses for cigarette lighters which is why the adapter is n't included it needs to be clipped directly to the battery and is good at filling large truck tires in a couple minutes	6
1	my car was stolen with device engaged it was stolen while my wife and i were both at home we did not hear a single thing their 'guarantee' by the way is a complete farse wow they 'll cover the deductable but only on a comprehensive coverage policy if you are wanting to keep your car safe do not buy this product ! !	6
0	the product does just what it says it does it helped me realize my mechanic was milking me for 800 00 when i could have fixed the problem myself for 107 00 when i confronted my mechanic he said nothing because he knew he had been had	6
0	ozium 's that new car scent is the closest scent to actual new car smell that i have tried the store where i buy it no longer carries it so i'm glad i found it here i always get a lot of compliments from friends riding in my car that it smells great	6
1	after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed in plain view of the sun the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again after the effort i put in carefully mounting the unit i'm very disappointed and do n't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work	6
0	simplifies car washing as soap and water are contained in the easy to use sprayer the best thing is the finish eliminates the need for drying with chamois etc and leaves a streak free spotless finish especially on windows i'm happy with it	6
0	does the trick for illuminating what 's in my pick up crossover bed tool box could use a more flexible mounting system including magnetic mount tap screw mount batteries last long due to low power requiermen	6
0	it looks funny in the ad but it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure i liked the bright colors so they do n't get out of sight	6
1	installed my bulldog 2030 ! it 's is a total piece of junk it only works when you tap on the hood you can pound on the back of the car and nothing put the sensor at max still nothing ! this is more of a novelty not an alarm its a freaking joke ! do n't waste your money	6
0	rated best polish in consumer magazine and probably is one of the best the problem is it does n't work unless driven by a human who 's going to invent a car polish that works by itself	6
0	works just as i anticipated great product very simple way to put onto your licence plate and definetly worth the buy it doesnt get no bette	6
0	has everything and more inside great price concidering how much you get literally has like 100 of stuff in it	6
0	after much research and trial and error this product rocks ! be certain to clean and rinse well before applying to a dry top jf	6
1	bought one of these to jump start my 3 6 litre 911 it doesnt have the power to even turn it over once when fully charged complete waste of time maybe it will start a lawn mower	6
1	i would n't recommend this product the positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it i as i was stranded rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w the remaining half of the clamp then the charger \( which was charged fully the previous night \) did n't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over i will be returning to the store tonight returning this item and purchasing a different charger	6
0	only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump otherwise i'm very pleased with this product	6
1	this piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it 's dead and it 's really easy to charge and use problem is after i had used it a couple times the cheapo plastic clamps both snapped now they ca n't grip on the battery terminals under warranty but so expensive to ship \( shipping not covered by warranty \) that it is n't worth it great idea shoddy construction all vector have these same plastic clamps so try to find one with metal clamps	6
1	one day when it was 100 degrees outside i used it in my car rolled all of the windows up and went into a store to shop when i came out and got into my car it was hotter than i could have ever imagined it had n't cooled my car prior to that either it looked like a very small fan blowing and that was it i came home took it off and threw it out i was not satisfied at all	6
1	it took 20 mins to fill a car tire from 20psi to 30psi truck air \? it could barely fill a car tire it would take over 3 hours for it to reach 300psi if it even could make it stay clear	6
0	i bought this seat cover for my daughter she loves anything with frogs on it they are really cute a friend had bought her one so i said i would get her the other to match and she really loves them she said that she wished that they made them for the back seat of her car also	6
0	that 's the best tool small and yet powerful ! i tested it ! resqme is my safety buddy	6
0	after watching myth busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests my father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes the lifehammers appear to be very well made and i fully expect them to do their job if ever needed the sheriffs office just recently pulled a body out of a local river his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river his girlfriends body was found right away but it took several months to find his body if they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better the lifehammer is cheap life insurance	6
0	i have n't purchased one of these but i'm curious if this is as reliable as as a traditional set of jumper cables \? or are there some jobs that jumper cables will do that this will not also how long does it take to jump start a car \? thanks in advance	6
0	this cover worked great kept the windshield dry ice free during the last snowstorm	6
0	this is a very good duster i have owned one for 5 years and now i have to replace	6
0	i bought this to polish the aluminum wheels in my 85 celica it works so good and it is so easy to use i have been polishing lots of other stuff just for the fun of it and the results area great	6
0	i have n't had to use it too much thank goodness but just knowing that it is in my car gives me peace of mind i did have to charge a camera battery on it and it worked great love it	6
0	it looks funny in the ad but it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure i liked the bright colors so they do n't get out of sight	6
1	this product does not cool down the car it is too small i would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks if you buy this please do not leave your pets or kids in the car and think that it is safe	6
0	i 've been using a mity mite for three years and have never had a problem until now it wo n't charge i 've used it to jump my toyota tundra \( v8 \) and honda civic when the batteries were deader than rocks i 've also jumped my riding mower which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down \( on top of the battery jumpers and all \) to get it to start hopefully my next mity mite will work as well i wish it had an attachment to blow up tires	6
1	it was not as advertised it did not come with the lighter power cord i am returning it because that is why i bought it i need a back lit display so that i can see it at night this will not stay on because it is battery powered only	6
0	i had been looking for a new gauge and really had my eyes on an analog dial type i found one surprisingly hard to find at local stores so i was thrilled to find this one on amazon and at a really decent price this accu gage model is simply great solid construction and finish it 's the perfect size perhaps the best feature is the release valve function which holds the acquired pressure reading from your tyre until you press the little thumb button to release the air pressure from the gauge ca n't say any more about it other than 'works and looks great	6
0	used this tool on 2001 odyssey gave me the code and fixed the problem it was egr related took it for emission inspection and passed used it also on my 2003 mitsubishi montero sport also used to check my relatives and friends car	6
0	i purchased the tink decal along with a several other tinkerbell car accessories for my daughter 's first car the decal is so cute i received the decal in record time and paid no shipping ! the price on amazon was great !	6
0	the scanner works great and the messages are understandable the internet update does not exist vaporware how can they sell a cable without having the drivers available \? \? dunno	6
1	a tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well that is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire my accugage was reading 5 psi high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer that 's why i give it only one star	6
1	i cannot believe they put this on the market once it gets wet there is n't much you can do about wringing it out it 's title is true it is a water magnet the problem is it just wo n't let the water go this towel is horrible i suggest using the 3 pack microfiber meguiar 's towels sold by amazon as well under the subject meguiar 's x2020 supreme shine microfiber pack of 3	6
0	these wipers are of the finest quality they do a wonderful job of clearing the rain from your windshield i highly recommend them for replacement of your current wiper blades you wo n't be disappointed in these excellent wipers i 've tried many these are the best and they 're made in the usa	6

0	i love them ! they are not only cute but practical the steering wheel cover protects my hands from the hot or cold temperature this is my first steering wheel protector and i will definitely always have one from now on this steering wheel cover seems like it will last a very long time my only concern is how to disinfect it i wonder if this is machine washable \? the license plate frame looks great and so far there 's no rust \) tip buy this package instead of separately and save some money	6
0	ordered mine directly from motive products for about the same price mine was missing the flexible tubing for brake bleeding and the handle was defective after emailing motive they promised to send a new handle and the missing tubing the unit worked as advertised a bit slow but be patient remember to warm up the engine a bit \( as directed in the instructions \) and unscrew the oil filler cap before drawing the oil out beats crawling under the vehicles and struggling with the oil pan nut ! will try bleeding brakes with it next time	6
0	this duster is heavy duty does a great job and is much bigger that i thought it would be overall i am very happy with this item if you need a car duster this one is a home run	6
0	i 've used this actron cp9175 autoscanner diagnostic code scanner with freeze frame data for obdii \( post 1996 \) vehicles on a 2001 lincoln towncar and a 1999 bmw z3 in both cases the device performed flawlessly and i'm very pleased with the ease of use	6
0	the unit does everything it promises i 've only used it once so far but i'm happy with it	6
0	comfort beads will change the way you drive your vehicle it 's almost like you 're floating on air i 've been using them for over 15 years i sure am glad there 's a company still manufacturing them awesome product ! i highly recommend it	6
0	goes on easy and wipes off super amazinglyl easy and gives a very nice finish i 'll wait a few months to see how long it lasts but the application was a pleasant experience one thing they said it does n't get the black trim white but it looks like it does the white is starting to show about 2 weeks after i applied it it is possible that it is from my previous wax but i do n't think so since i covered that with mother 's back to black product	6
1	i purchaced this product because its a great idea the problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window hopefully they can take this design an improve the suction and maybe add a battery similar to the solar lights you put in your driveway	6
1	it 's a pain because to save time you need to install it permanently to make it worth it then you can never use that window for anything else it 's a pain because it will not work on tinted windows run	6
1	what a bad product ! they did n't last two weeks before they began to smear my windshield	6
0	this is the best car wash i have ever used ! ! ! ! ! along with the nxt generation car wax it makes your car look like it 's had a brand new paint job this product is a must for people who want the best for their car	6
0	my husband and i ordered one for all our family members for christmas they all appreciated it something people do n't think to buy for themselves it 's a good quality product i would reccomend one for each car	6
0	this unit works great i bought it for my father and it works like it 's supposed to it has enough juice for a regular size crt tv and has been used to jump start a few times the first unit i bought had a problem with the generator part and would not power anything up i notified amazon and in no time flat ups was back to pick it up and i got a new unit the next day ! great service from amazon ! ! ! and a great product too	6
0	i 've used gs27 on two cars of mine that had scratches i 've noticed it will permanently remove or greatly improve nearly all minor to medium scratches it really depends on the scratch and how deep it is it works like magic on some scratches and dramatically improves most other mild to medium grade scratches it works alot like a car wax as far as application removal you have to buff it off with a cloth and it will have a brilliant shine the only reason i do n't give it 5 stars is it does n't completly remove all scratches	6
1	this bag was junk on a 2001 4runner the poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload i realize it is n't made for all vehicles but i purchased mine only after speaking with lund who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware great service from amazon terrible service from lund	6
1	they broke the first time that i used them the locking mechanism is cheap and slides out of its intended slot do n't waste your money on this item	6
0	great product ! this tool is very intuitive and easy to use i find the greatest value is in having the mil codes internal to the device which makes finding the faulty component right at your fingertips i bought the obdii fault code book but quickly learned that i did n't need to have it	6
0	the money shipping for this item is right this thing will get up to 125 psi no problem i have a corsair 2 5 gallon tank this lil fella i do n't know why you would need anymore ! ! ! ! thx amazon for the servic	6
0	this is a nice cellphone i got it from a local cellphone shop free and only 1 year contract eventually prices will be free like the motorola razor v3 small phone and i like the mp3 player mode	7
0	it is small and compact easy for travel but also good for home use	7
0	the photo of this premiun side case is not at the photo the side case in the photo have a treo logo and the producto do n't have i	7
0	this is the best phone i have ever had reception is crystal clear and it is also a mp3 player with the ablility to add a memory card video and voice recording capabilities and a 8x zoom camera and best of all very very user friendly	7
1	i am not using this bluetooth dongle because the accessory software was so darned difficult to set up instead i cut my loses and purchased a different dongle which was truely plug and play	7
1	these are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from i sent mine back	7
0	i recently bought a nokia 6265 and wanted to upload some music to it and create my own ringtones however the nokia ca 53 cable was around 50 dollars this was a great alternative so far everything that i have used it for is working flawlessly i would highly suggest buying this item if you wanted a cheaper alternative than the ca 53	7
1	i bought this for my new samsung slider phone \( which i love \) but this case is to snug for it the slider phone is a bit larger than the razor and once you get it in the case its hard to get out it 's a cute case i would love to use if it was just a little larger	7
1	label states that it is for a 600 it doesnt fit a 650 as well as i thought i	7
0	i bought one of these extended batteries on e bay and was really sorry it did n't hold a charge i was reluctant to try again but i was glad i did this time i got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery	7
1	this battery is not compatible with my verizon samsung a670 when you put it in it reads bad battery on the screen and will go no further	7
0	i'm a previous owner of body glove cel phone cases \( a moto v810 \) i purchased this item from amazon a few days ago for my 6255 my cel fits perfectly the case protects every part of my cel \( buttons screens jacks \) and the use of every option in the cel is so comfortable as it would be without the case and looks nice my next phone will have its body glove case too	7
0	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
0	my friend from hk just got this phone and ask me to buy her an eforcity screen protector she loves it ! !	7
1	same comments on the latch opening easily my complaint about the belt clip it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use would n't buy again	7
0	this is a good thick screen protector that stays solidly stuck to your screen i do n't foresee it peeling ever it has a slightly frosted surface to cut down on glare but the frosting is impossible to see when the screen is on i 've washed mine it comes out clean as new and the sticky side stays sticky just be very careful not to bend it at all or stress it in one place it is extremely sensitive to bending and if you bend it it will never go back so be extra careful	7
0	how come phone accessories do n't qualify for prime shipping \? how are they different from other electronics	7
1	yes the cable fits but the cd driver is just for the 8300 i was not able to get it working	7
1	unless you have a cd with a program that is specific to your phone this cable	7
1	i was extremly disappointed when i received this it did not fit my phone and promptly was thrown into the garbage can i had one of the first razor phones and it did not fit when i got th belt clip i went to cingular to upgrade my phone to a newer version and brought the belt clip that did n't fit either i would no recommend this product to anyone even if it does cost a dollar with shipping cost it costs about 6 00	7
0	my only complaint and consequently the 4 star rating is that sometimes i do n't hear the blackberry or feel the vibration apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the oem plastic holster	7
1	i received 2 2 5mm to 3 5mm stereo headphone adapter one did n't work the other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality if you push the headphone jack \( male \) all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker you have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers and even then the quality is not good	7
0	it 's not rocket science it works or it does n't the device works fine my only complaint is that the cord is a bit short but that is of lesser concern considering the price the short cord is the only reason it did n't get a 5 star rating it 's well worth the money	7
1	this deal was too good to be true of course i was n't expecting any name brand stuff here but at least i expected them to all work i do n't know if i got a bad earbud or what but it adds static and noise and therefore cannot be used the case i did n't need but it does fit well and looks to be decently constructed the power adapter seems to work fine so basically i spent 9 99 and am only using the power adapter i guess that 's a good enough deal i think i 'll go spend some extra money and get a brand name earbud headset though	7
0	these are very good and not expensive you buy these at staples and they charge 5 more i agree that a public exchange is needed if anyone knows of one can you please post that information here we 'll all appreciate it ! anybody want to trade the extras	7
0	i recommend this phone to anybody i absolutely love it i have had it for three months now and not a problem so far the music player is great and i swear the camera looks alot better than 1 3 mega pixel the handset is wonderful and so is the headset included with it if you buy this phone it will last you a long time but yeah so far no problems whatsoever i love it	7
1	i got this phone in january and i had to take it back the day i got it because it kept losing service and dropping calls they gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone but it was n't the one i have now is n't as bad as the first one but it still loses service and drops calls constantly do n't buy this phone	7
0	it 's just as advertised the cradle has 2 cords a 110v power cord that 's just for charging the spare battery and a usb cord for charging syncing the 8125 use it every day	7
1	this case actually scratches and destroys your pearl the inside is very rough and uneven pieces of leather are sewn together in a cheap way that destroys your phone the phone does n't provide any protection on top i really regret buying this my phone is all scratched get a soft case that stays on permanently pass this one up	7
0	i really like this phone the camera quality the software everything is excellent	7
0	driver install was easy and bitpim access works just fine the cable i received also charges the phone \( vx8300 from verizon \)	7
1	how hard can it be shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of a charger	7
0	good battery life \( certainly much better than the old one it replaced \) for the most part it is indistinguishable from the original however it does n't fit quite as snugly in the dock style charger that came with my phone \( not the kind that plugs into the bottom of the phone but the kind that sits on your desk and contacts the battery directly \) that is a little annoying that it tends to fall out if i'm not paying attention i 'll wake up the next morning and my phone wo n't actually have been charged but it still works	7
0	i got the a data transfer cable the house and car charge cheaper than what i would have paid for the car charger alone you ca n't beat this price	7
0	i recently got this phone and love it t mobile 's service may not be the best but i have had no problems with the phone itself for all the people saying that it is n't really magenta it is the pink razr offered by cingular is a pale pink the t mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown i looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades	7
0	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
0	overall i like it the best part is the flip up screen protector i have had 2 zire models and managed to break both screens my dislike is that i have had it for 4 months and it is no longer form fitting i have tried to get info on how to shrink it to be tight again to no avail as for the sd card issue i remedied that by carfully opening up the slot with an xacto blade to allow room for the card to clearly eject to keep from having to take the skin off to reset my treo i drilled a hole in the back right through the battery cover to allow for easy resetting when my treo crashes	7
0	i 've been using this phone with the net10 service since march and have to say i am very happy with it coverage areas have been great i do n't use a cell phone very often so this was the most economical way for me to go although the phone does n't have all the bells and whistles like other phones have it gets the job done	7
0	though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might be used to at first it quickly becomes a non factor and though it does n't provide quite as much extra life as i had hoped it would it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry a solid purchase	7
1	it looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily the shipping was fast and the price was right	7
0	fast service good price look forward to future business dealings	7
1	i paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards the phone will say insert sim card even if it is inside it recyles and when it does so the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped there is a very minimal selection of graphics ringtones and games you cannot change the mini display save your money because you might end up spending 40 50 bucks on sim cards and another 50 for a replacement phone	7
0	this product is a good deal if you know how to use it unfortunately if you are purchasing this product to add music to your phone you may want to reconsider the verizon v cast product would be better because it comes with headphones if you already have the headphones \( which cost anywhere from 20 100 \) than this product will be good for you	7
1	these are not the same that come on the earbud and are not easy to use or to hear from i sent mine back	7
0	the touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice the onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen \( easier sad than done \) if anything does attach it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer	7
0	i agree with previous reviewers \( gely zencity \) regarding this cable the price was right set up was easy and \( with the bitpim program \) you can communicate with your lg vx8300 efficiently i loaded my whole outlook calendar and contacts into the phone as well as some songs wallpapers and ringtones do n't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from verizon 's sites \( vcast and such \) just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music tones that you already own	7
1	i cannot believe how poor this product was made the hell with this product noboday noooooooooboooooody buy thsi product talk about poor	7
0	holds the phone in an attractive snug leather case ! clips to belt and holds tight since the phone is horizontal and not vertical i do n't have trouble catching it on things i 've broken the clip on several cases getting in and out of the car the phone would catch on something and the plastic clip would snap this case works great and eliminates that problem ! the perfect solution	7
0	absolutely loved this snap on cover for my new motorola razr v3m fits perfectly	7
0	skin was great and was shipped as described it really helps protect my q i like the texture of the skin feels like rubber overall it 's worth buying it really protects my q from scratches	7
1	when i started charging my k750i it didnt charge at all no matter what this is a load of s dont buy i	7
1	motorola one is far better in quality as well to use	7
1	this product had a strong rubber petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it	7
1	function followed form on this one ! ! you ca n't see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light so you ca n't see who 's calling or what time it is without opening the phone it hurts your ear when talking the buttons are difficult to push it 's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers too many prompts to reply to a text thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool' i returned it and got my money back	7
0	this is a great holster really cheap price i ordered a couple this time because it 's only fault is that it will break pretty easily if you sit in a chair and hit it on the arm of a chair but for the money it 's great	7
0	i am very satisfied with the holster for my motorola phone i would recommend this holster to anyone who needs one for a work phone that is easy to carry and get to when needed	7
0	this charger is an excellent value it works beautifully with my treo 700p smartphone i love the retractable cable that quickly rewinds inside the device with the touch of a button making the whole unit quick and easy to store the only complaint i 've heard is that the large blue power light is too bright at night it does n't annoy me but my wife asks me to turn the device sideways or upside down so the blue glow does n't shine up into her eyes no problem	7
0	i have not had any problems with this phone i dont use it for long periods at a time only in the car and for text adding minutes is easy and i really get my moneys worth with the rollover i averaged it at less than 10 bucks a month with 600 minutes to spare so its great for me i got better ringtones online and still waiting to see about wallpaper overall i would recommend this phone if you dont need more than 100 minutes per week	7
1	i purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone my old battery would not hold a charge anymore so i wanted a new one the new one proved to be just as bad i do n't think it 's a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead would not recommend ordering this if you 're looking to replace an old one	7
0	i like the shape of the plug so that it does n't cover up any other outlets it works what else can i say	7
1	i went through 2 of these in as many months the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working people regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone could n't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no '	7
1	the sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering i loved it when it was n't broken even wind did n't seem to bother the headset much the voice quality was great on transmission and reception but the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and ca n't be replaced i got a new headset the first time on warranty the second time it broke i could have gotten a free replacement again but i did n't want the hassle i have a scala now that i 've been using for months and i'm very happy with it even though the sound and wind immunity does n't measure up to the logitech	7
1	i 've purchased this car charger for my treo and theorder was delivered promptly unfortunately theconnector that was suppose to go into my treo 650 didnot fit \( too big \) so i was n't able to connect it andcharge the phone i send it back	7
0	if you do not know the best thing about this ophone then that may be the reason that you are looking at this silly thing ! ! ! do n't bye this thing or look at it too much because why are you doing that \? \? ! ! ! everyone should know that the best thing about the razors telephone is that the telephone that is a razor does not have a chiord on it ! ! ! why would you by a chord for a telephone that is so great because it doesn t have a chord jeez !	7
0	this car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right	7
0	i was n't expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case but i'm very impressed i bought from accessory one the total cost was about 4 the case fits nearly perfectly every hole is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case others have complained of chipping paint but in the week i 've been using this it has n't chipped yet ca n't do any better for the	7
0	this item cost 1 penny \( of course the shipping was 4 84 \) but i thought it was a great deal compared to what these cheap little holsters cost in the stores i 've had it for two weeks and it has n't broken yet nor has it dropped the phone accidentally ca n't go wrong with the price order a dozen of these if you are rough on your phone holsters	7
1	this product stopped working after about a week or two lesson learned buy oem products instead of cheap knock off	7
0	i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product	7
1	this is virtually impossible to apply without trapping dust bubbles on the surface of the screen i attempted 4 times washing the back thoroughly between each attempt cleaning the cingular screen with a new lens cloth once specks of dust touch the adhesive they 're there for good and the protector is ruined i gave up because i was more worried about scratching the device screen from repeatedly prying the protector off than i was of the scratches the protector was meant to avoid ! save your money and just buy a good case to put your 8525 in	7
0	nice price point good quality ca n't complain	7
0	i just bought this headset for use with an lg vx 8300 the stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone \( has microphone built in \) works fine	7
1	poorly made and weak pulls the battery off my razr everytime i disconnect it from the holder stopped using it within a day after purchase there are better holsters for the razr on the market avoid this one	7
0	i needed a razr car charger and the crystal clear hard shell case was included with the purchase i did not think i would even use it but i love it ! it is light weight easy to clip onto my jeans and does a great job of protecting my razr phone !	7
1	we 've had 3 of the lg1500 in our family plan for nearly a year very inconsistent service when calling our son i would get a message that his number was blacklisted after calling cingular several times we demanded new phones not lg1500 we were told it was like for like exchange but that policy is not in writing so we 're getting a different brand if a phone does n't work the company needs to get rid of them !	7
0	overall i'm happy with the skin it fits the treo 700 very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the 700w and p if you do n't know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w not the 700p not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i'm going to see if there 's a way to remove these somehow	7
0	the product came promptly and i am happy with the quality however fitment was n't perfect as the ends would sit a little higher than my treo not a huge problem but something i would feel everytime i reach for the stylus but the pen works pretty good and it feels sturdy in my hands i would definately recomment this product to others	7
1	first time when i plugged in the cell phone displayed error message that charging error remove immediately since then i am not using this	7
1	this product is the worst of its kind ! it lasted a couple of months at the most it is not at all worth the price no matter how cheap i picked one up at walmart for ten bucks that works great do n't waste your time on this one it is cheap but do n't be had stay away from this product	7
1	i have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear it 's unobtrusive and light however i constantly get complaints from whoever i'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet i have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset the problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth	7
1	going by the plantronics name i bought a pair of m60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone they are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a try she got a nasty feedback squeal several times during a long call essentially unusable unless we find some trick that we have missed so far we ordered a sennheiser pc120 to try instead	7
0	i 've had my snap on case for about a month and i love it the magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone the bottom case could fit a little more snugly but it 's not a problem	7
1	i bought this and i have no clue how to sync to my lg cu500 and it dont tell so i wouldnt buy this usb cable i recommend gettting the one from lg electronics even though it is more its worth it	7
1	i bought this phone at the same time i bought the i870 i 've dropped my i870 a couple of times and it 's fine my husband dropped the rugged phone once and the antenna which sticks out like a thumb snapped off nextel does not warrantee the phone unless you have their insurance plan regardless of the advertising claims that this phone is durable to army standards what army \? do not buy this phone ! \( unless of course you also want to buy the insurance to replace it when it breaks in a few months	7
0	great little item charges phone and second battery at the same time it is nice to have it on the desk and i can use the speaker phone on my desk no complaints about this charger at all	7
1	i love the way the phone looks and feels but that 's about it from finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone i 've ever owned i 've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise	7
1	the gel inserts on the jabra is quite uncomfortable at least for me it 's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear and forget about jogging wearing this also the insert comes off very easily and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears you need to find the other sizes of the insert sound quality is mediocre as callees often complain about wind noise from my end i'm not happy with these	7
1	i purchased this crystal case to protect my new slvr l7 it does n't fit the case is not wide enough to fit together over the phone do n't waste your money	7
0	this cover is what my baby blackberry needed to be protected and safe	7
0	very good phone nice color screen easy to read lots of features	7

1	i think that logitech make the best accessories i have the camera the fancy dinovo bluetooth keyoard so naturally this headset was a no brainer the reason i got it was to use it with my computer setup as opposed to looking like a dork walking around in public it worked on my dell 9200 laptop fine with skype however it did not work with my dell 8400 desktop using the logitech bluetooh hub do n't you find that strange \? aside from that it also did not work with my sony ericsson phone \( ca n't remember the model \) in addition it really hurts my ears not the most comfortable so you decide if this product works for you	7
0	this is a must for anyone that is 'mobile' i am never home always at starbucks or libraries studying and this added safety is necessary to protecting the player	7
0	i am thoroughly enjoying the longer battery life i had to charge my old battery everyday i only have to charge the new battery every 2 3 days	7
0	the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications \( gps car holder \) but does do what is was designed to do solid grip and non slip would be nice if it was not so thick	7
0	the silicone protective covering for the treo was exactly what i wanted and just what i expected it to be it fits my treo 650 perfectly and i could n't be happier i am going to buy another in a different color	7
0	the device works fine and i do n't feel i over paid sure there are better hands free devices out there but this one is reliable	7
0	this is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt my husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks i would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls	7
1	i 've used the headset for a little over a year and although plagued with disconnects when idle was relatively pleased with the sound quality not being connected when calls came in was a major annoyance there was no notice when it disconnected recently the plastic ear clip broke and i contacted logitech and was informed that since it was over the one year warranty my only option would be to purchase a new headset a huge price to pay for a piece that costs pennies logitech 's concern for its customers appears to be nonexistant	7
0	works fine difficult to connect but connects securely comes with an unlabeled cd \( could n't tell one side from the other \) that has a great selection of ringtones and wallpapers though the tones are n't labeled in any helpful way i was impressed it also has links to any 1st party software you need though i'm sure a google search would be just as easy	7
0	i like the way it does n't take up space in the console when i am not using it and it seems to charge the l6 just fine ! no complaints with the devise or the service from amazon	7
0	works great with my sch a950 and bitpim	7
0	the treo600 has all the functions i needed phone calendar camera etc two shortcomings 1 \) the screen is not good for viewing pictures but that 's what i get for being unwilling to spend more for a treo6502 \) the phone failed to dial two times in two months i had to turn off the phone and on again to fix the problem	7
0	this is the kind of thing you do n't care about unless it malfunctions i 've had no problems at all with it it seems sturdily built and unlikely to break easily the right angle bend in the plug means it is less likely to snap off in the device \( a problem with straight plugs \) it does n't seem to have been made as cheaply as possible but instead made well	7
0	the whole process took only 5 minites on the phone with cingular wireless customer service to port over my number from verizon the treo 750 was a snap to figure out setting up my email took only a few minutes i 've owned it for three weeks now and i am still discovering great phone pda features i bought a 4gb mini sd card \( samsung memory \) from ebay for 39 99 combined it can hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 to 300 songs i also bought a shure tec3 earbuds for 110 they 're about the best sounding earbuds you can get with a 2 5mm jack	7
1	worked good for a few months then battery started draining fast now after just 1 or 2 calls the battery is dead	7
0	i have trouble to buy from bestbuy but i ordered it from amazon cheapest price and good product ! thanks	7
0	the cable works great with my sgh 707 but the cd did not have the right driver however you can download the correct driver from samsung com i recomend to buy the cable and then download the driver for your phone	7
1	the darn thing broke almost immediately when i tried to switch gel covers \( it comes with 3 different sizes \) the entire earpiece came off in my hands ! what a flimsy piece of crap i just sent it back to amazon i'm never buying a jabra product again	7
0	i made the mistake of ordering a 7 00 battery and i thought my phone was broken because of the way it was acting i replaced my new battery with this new battery and now it works like a champ so word to the wise just get this battery and you will not have my problems well worth it	7
0	i would like to buy two or more shells do you offer differents colors to choose from \? wich colors are there \? this is because i would like to pay only one shipping fee please answere asap	7
0	i will keep this short and to the point this is the best phone i have ever owned its great for taking pictures the pictures come out so clear	7
0	helps reduce clutter and now i can actually close my cup holder tray \( acura rdx \)	7
0	product is excellent and does all it is supposed to do	7
1	although this product is very nice i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect to me the words charge all at once means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall however this is not the case this item is simply a method for organizing you devices although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the 34 99 i paid and if it was n't a gift and christmas was n't 3 5 days away i would return it i feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer	7
1	battery charges okay but phone cradle connection poor fit and phone does not charge most of the time	7
0	the case looks great and it is very slim fitting so the phone doesnt look bulk	7
0	durable thick does n't interfere in any way with the touch screen i have n't had to wash it yet so i have n't tried out that feature but i highly recommend it over the other screen protectors and with the low cost of one of these it 's been totally worth it to me \( hey after spending hundreds on your treo what 's a few dollars \? \)	7
1	thanks god that the phone can survive a moderate fall the case pops open very easily and despite to supposedly snug fit at the time you receive the case its all loose after that another disappointment the circular 'knob' that screws into the back of the case that attaches in turn to the belt clip often screws out causing again you guessed it falls	7
1	i do n't know about other company but accessory export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture i bought a genuine contour leather case for motorola razr v3 but what i got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic there is no leather on the case at all not only that the cover smells like petroleum oil	7
0	i bought my treo 750v a couple of days ago i got really impressed with its features and had none of the problems already reported like short time lived batery the only problem i am facing is with setting my voice mail the icon shown in the today page does not accept any number i will to attach to it as a result i was forced to create a new speed dial icon with my voice mail number i really hope this is a problem to be fixed soon by palm with a downloadable file because except for this problem treo 750 is really great	7
1	i bought my wife a brand new v170 for her birthday she wanted an extra charger to take to work so i bought this one big mistake ! it simply would not fit in the charger jack so basically it 's a worthless piece of plastic last night when my wife was cleaning the counter she threw it in the trash brand new box and all at 7 99 it was n't even worth the trouble to try to return it do n't make the same mistake i did	7
0	this is a great skin for a treo 700 i have used this product for about four months and had another brand prior to that as others have noted it does increase the thickness somewhat \( but certainly no less than leather cases etc \) but the thickness gains you considerable protection i have dropped my phone on concrete several times and nary a scratch i like the design of this unit as it leaves the keyboard exposed and thus it is easy to type the function buttons are under the skin but easy to press	7
1	it did not fit my phone and i was forced to go out and but another one	7
0	i recently got this phone and love it t mobile 's service may not be the best but i have had no problems with the phone itself for all the people saying that it is n't really magenta it is the pink razr offered by cingular is a pale pink the t mobile phone is the hot pink magenta shown i looked at them at bestbuy before buying and saw that the different carriers have different shades	7
1	i would return this product if i thought it was worth my time and effort the 2 5 mm jack is slightly too small creating a loose connection that ruins the experience of using it when doing anything active i tried both adapters \( i bought the 2 pack \) in two different devices and in all cases the connections was slightly loose in positive news the connection at the 3 5 mm end is nicely snug	7
0	this case does what it is supposed to do it protects your palm treo phone it is very nice looking and durable the only negative comment that i will make about the case is that occasionally the memory card gets ejected when taking the phone out of the case due to the snug fit that is why i gave it a 4 5 amazon has the best price for the case and it is well worth the price	7
0	great phone durable and so far dependable i did buy a larger battery there is one complaint sometimes the person you call sounds like they are drunk i do n't know if it is the service or the phone	7
0	this is the correct cable for the tungsten e2 it 's not listed in the product description but you can find the info on zip linq 's web site i 've had several of these for other devices great products	7
1	maybe it 's because this product is not approved for windows but i could n't get it to install	7
0	the product works very well but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone overall i would recommend it if the user pays attention when connecting great buy for the price	7
1	function followed form on this one ! ! you ca n't see anything in the outer window especially in the sun light so you ca n't see who 's calling or what time it is without opening the phone it hurts your ear when talking the buttons are difficult to push it 's my third motorola and the prompts are different than others motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers too many prompts to reply to a text thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool' i returned it and got my money back	7
0	purchased this phone a little over a month ago and so far everything works well and have no problems many nice features and the service in the state of ga is good	7
1	do not order from this company the cable does not fit in the phone unfortunately i did not read the reviews before purchasing from eforcity the cable came a few days late when it arrived the cable did not even fit the software for the cable was defective after it had finished installing windows xp came up with an error message that stated the completion of this installation could cause corruption with the operating system eforcity is awful	7
1	i only buy it because i must to have a battery backup for long trips and i ca n't wait for the seidios battery	7
0	it worked great just like i excpected everything is still working well i am very happy with my purchase	7
1	this thing doesnt slide well and the front cover falls off easily not worth the material it was made from if you do n't ever open your phone this is the case cover for yo	7
1	it has a samsung logo but it looks fake after i bought it the belt clipper tore of the phone holder with no reason	7
0	my tracfone has worked out good so far customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use if you decide to get a tracfone please email me for a quick referral before activating it we each will get 100 free minutes from the 'refer a friend' program i 'll also send you the simple instructions to follow i 've used tracfone for quite a while so i should be able to answer any questions you might have ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes	7
1	the headphone has a standard 8mm plug and wo n't work with the katana the case is absolutely worthless do n't waste your money on this product	7
0	i originally bought another motorola charger from a verizon dealer which was twice the price of this one i returned the other one because this one worked just as good if not better ! it actually fully charges my phone in less time and i can swear my battery life lasts even longer it 's a great product for a great price ! delivery was quick too	7
1	the color of the product i received is nothing like the picture ! if you want royal blue then this is the case for you	7
0	this is a nice cellphone i got it from a local cellphone shop free and only 1 year contract eventually prices will be free like the motorola razor v3 small phone and i like the mp3 player mode	7
1	i owned samsung t809 months ago and i was very frustrated because the bluetooth does n't work well sometimes it has connection \( bluetooth \) but most of the time it does n't work yeah ! it 's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one	7
0	i received my phone and everything was good when i looked at my bill amazon did not close out my previous 2 months i had left on my contract with cingular so cingular tried to charge me some liquidation fee of 30 i called and had it removed	7
0	but it does have some faults i have had it for some time now i got it for my 11th birthday i have reviewed the cingular version too even though mines verizon faults very short battery life i have to charge it almost every day ! camera the picture you take ca n't move or it comes out all messed up good parts big screen easy to read ! recording videos even though you get 15 seconds i still use that to make funny videos with my friends it 's style i love the color and style ! my friends are all jealous overall i think it 's a great phone	7
1	i bought this exact case at the local mall and was told there was no refunds or exchanges doh ! this crappy case broke within 3 weeks of use i only took it off approximately 3 times and babied it when i did no jostling or forcing the case the little prongs that held the front faceplate on broke and the teal metallic color started wearing after only this short time do not buy this pos unless you want to throw your money out	7
0	if you 're the type of person that does n't spend hours on the phone and want a good basic phone this phone is for you i bought this phone in the uk at the carphone warehouse for around 40 bucks and it works great i would say that the only gripe about this phone in the us is the price i would n't pay over 40 bucks for it it 's a nice basic phone the screen is a colored one and it has cool ringtones	7
1	the product description should state that it does not work with the verizon v3c ! when plugged in it states unauthorized charger and will not charge at all \( although if the battery is dead it will give you enough juice to speak but it still wo n't charge \( \? \) \)	7
0	i purchased this headset \( \) and the key features i like are as follows 1 aaa battery no charging ! 2 easy to pair with my phone \( motorola slvr l7 european version \) 3 no static on both ends 4 have not had a complaint about echoes as other reviews stated 5 price affordable but acts like an expensive headset 6 volume is good 7 fits well does not feel lose 8 22 hours of talk time before battery has to be replaced i am very happy with it i would highly recommend this product for those looking for a bargain and for those that hate to recharge their headset	7
0	these work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound but they 're great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping the only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying	7
0	although the i607 \( blackjack \) was not listed on the packaging as a compatible device it works perfectly the earbuds sound surprisingly good and a simple push of a button to answer a call even on the call you hear the caller in both ears and the other party said they were able to hear me clearly	7
0	i'm not really a gadget guy and what gadgets i do have get pretty beat up when the company gave me a blackberry so i can stay in touch i needed to at least take care of the thing so i bought this skin from speck products its is absolutely awesome ! no more dings or scratches i'm a minimalist and for that the blackberry skin is perfect ! a cool look not bulky easy access to the buttons they did their homework on this product a must have for anyone who owns a blackberry i also see they have these for the treos	7
0	i have had this motorola v171 for a year now and i absolutely love it the features are so easy to understand the customer service reps for net 10 wireless are very hard to understand this phone is a net 10 wireless phone net 10 wireless is a subsidiary of tracfone i would this phone to anybody looking for a prepaid cell phone plan i love it because only for a limited time you get 300 minutes free upon activation of your phone i would also strongly recommend that if anybody purchases this motorola activate it on its a whole lot easier than calling	7
0	i purchased the cable for my nokia 6255i the cable came faster than expected \( i find amazon fulfillment of orders very slow \) the cable came with the software driver \( although i did not need it \) and worked great with my already installed nokia sync software electro island had the best price by far and the service was excellent i would definitely use them again	7
0	i'm very happy with this case i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo 700p but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it in other words i did n't want something that was attached to the treo permanently this did the trick it 's simple but looks good seems to be solidly made as well	7
1	samsung a670 is a lame phone also the battery life is not good it did n't have many features so its just a waste of your money the ringtone volume was too low i would suggest samsung improved this phone i am not sure if i ever want another samusung again i have all these samsung accessories and they are in no use they just sitting in the box colleting dust	7
1	i would have thought that amazon would have fix the problem that it did not fit v170 i ordered and guess what it did not fit i am returning it6 6 0	7
1	i have ear gels before but none that were this cheap \( and i do n't mean cost ! \) there was no consistency in the size \( they come in different sizes but no two were the same \) and without fail every single one i tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece every one ! it did n't seem to matter if they were small or larger or even larger than the ear piece the material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance i am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere i seriously do not recommend these to anyone	7
1	i purchased this to replace a lost holster the first time i tried to place the 7290 in the case it split at the seams	7
0	i switched to this phone from verizon e815 some of the details i find different pros sleek designgood battery lifecompact2mp cameracons choppy voice sometimes hard to listenscreen and buttons little smallworks for me as i do n't use the phone for internet email or use lot other features	7
1	stay away from this phone the 2 last phones stopped charging and are not able to be repaired picking up my last i530 if this one goes im canceling my nextel service which includes 4 total phones on company account and looking for a new carrier i 've had it ! nextel and motorola ca n't figure out that this phone is junk	7
0	this protects my ppc 6700 wonderfully i 've dropped it many times and this case protected it like i wanted no scratches nothing having room for the extended battery is great too because the extended battery adds hours and hours too the life of my phone	7
1	the premium vehicle power charger was not compatible i returned i	7
0	treo 750 one of the best and coolest phone i am in love with this phone because of windows os it is very easy to use and understand functions slim and light weight love the touch screen function i ordered this phone on sunday evening and got it on wednesday amazon offers two day free shipping on all phones also i ordered two phones \( family plan \) there was some problem in other phone i requested the replacement and amazon first sent me the replacement of that phone through free 1 day shipping and they gave me 30 days to return problem phone i am so impressed with amazon 's service	7
0	my perception is that the headset is very confortable to use and the clarity of my voice is fine i use the headset all day without any discomfort i higly recommend it over the other types of headset	7
0	i'm very happy with this purchase overall this battery is a huge improvement over that ridiculous battery that comes with the phone talk time and internet time are increased greatly i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast though that is still better than the original battery it may just be the phone i have no idea if it is as good as the one sprint sells for 60 dollars it is definitely worth 20 bucks all day long	7
1	i have a lg vx5300 which this vendor and product said it was compatible with was a no go product would not install from enclosed cd computer would not recognize cell phone through enclosed usd cord a loss of time and money i have since ordered received and installed from another product data point from another vendor	7
0	this headset is actually really comfortable i really do n't opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly the sound quality is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well great product and great price	7
1	este producto no es lo que anuncian 100 metros de alcance y solo palabras no sirve no la debuelvo porque me sale mas caro el envio de lo que cuesta esta porqueri	7
1	i bought this for 30 from best buy what a waste of money ! the ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it the sound quality is terrible ! people i am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my motorola v300 what is worse people i am talking to hear me very poorly they say there is so much background noise it sounds like i am in a noisy bar even when i'm just sitting in my car people can barely hear me over the background noise racket	7
1	i read the other review about these falling out of the reviewer 's ear i figured at this price i 'd try for my wife and i when i first tried them on i instantly realized that the other reviewer was dead on even with the provided clip these fall out and you 're better off not using them frustrating that all these cell phone companies are now going to proprietary jacks on cell phones two stars only because they do work if you hold them with your hands and they were inexpensive	7
0	i am using this as a spare so have n't actually put it in the phone yet i will definately take it on vacation with me	7
0	a perfect fit for my l6 i love the protection for the screen it covers all of it so you do n't need those plastic screen covers do n't be afraid if you drop your phone because it 's protected	7
1	the price is high considering that there are newer models	7
1	i was able to get this cable working eventually after some research on my own the cable itself is o k but i had to locate the correct drivers on my own and it 's definitely not intuitive and definitely not plug and play support from the seller consisted of referring me to a competitor 's website to locate the drivers on my own also \( and with no offense intended \) if you think a driver is a person behind a steering wheel then this is not the product for you	7
1	junk junk junk mine lasted for only three weeks then one day stopped working	7
0	i got this case holster a while back after another maker 's fell apart in a short time i was impressed with the reviews i saw here what i would add is that the case is durable and i am very pleased with it after owning it for about 6 months	7
1	while this is a functional holster be aware that you may like me find that your phone hangs up as you extract it from the holster i know i know you can turn off the answer phone when opened option but that is not preferred by everyone you may also find that the phone does not stay in the holster securely	7
0	kind of difficult to place without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector does what it is supposed to do	7
1	i bought this case to protect the best bar phone on the market the sony ericsson w810i within 2 days the case already started to crack and chip i dropped the phone once and the phone came flying out of the case the case also scratches easily too the only good thing is that it looks nice and stylish but i have a feeling that i am going to have to replace it pretty soon bottom line this case only protects against scratches i was actually looking at the clear silicone cases	7
1	the case fit well but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart i'm very gentle with my phone but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one it no longer stays on so i threw it away the bottom is still on great but it dos n't do me any good without a top !	7
0	i really like this case it keeps my phone from getting scratched up and it 's really cute good price	7
1	i guess you get what you pay for this charger works but apparently not quite the way sony ericsson would like it to when using this charger my se w300i often reports charging errors this never happened with the original se charger \( which my dog ate hence the new one \)	7
0	this is a great product it actually fits into my ear properly and i can hear clearly through it it is easy to operate and the charge last for many days i would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an earpiece that fits comfortably and is just the right size	7
0	great choice for the casual to heavy duty sansa user strong and looks good it even comes with a clear plastic screen saver i am very happy with this product	7
1	my wife and i got two of these phones for free when she switched to cingular after two weeks we exchanged her phone for a new one of the same model because it would freeze and drop calls constantly my phone was fine but has lately been experiencing the same issues i know service is not the problem as i had a samsung phone through cingular before and had no problems calling from the same areas sometimes i 'll have 5 bars and all of the sudden it goes to 0 and takes a minute or two to come back i do not recommend this phone even though it is was free it 's not worth the frustration	7
1	i know from experience i have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years i think one company makes them all they will not last the cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out for some reason it only happens with the palm type cables my ipod and usb retractable cables have lasted perhaps one just ends up using the palm device cables more for hot synching and or charging daily see my palm page at	7
0	i think this is going to be a very good phone but the advertized price on this web site says retail is some 800 00 dollars well i called nokiausa direct and regular retail from them is 499 00all day as many as you want so it should be considerably less on amazon you would think \? i guess not !	7
0	the protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications \( gps car holder \) but does do what is was designed to do solid grip and non slip would be nice if it was not so thick	7
0	my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones i 've ever heard i do n't know what it 's called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time including him it 's great for a business that has many locations i only give this product four stars because i have n't tried it myself so i do n't know all the features but i hope the review i 've provided helps	7
1	i do n't know about you folks but i have small ears though the sound on these ear buds are good i ca n't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they 're too big for me and forget about trying to walk and keep them in my ears unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords good idea badly designed for size differences	7
1	bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return replacement deadline should n't a cell phone battery last longer than a month \? \? they refuse to refund or replace they are a shady company and i 'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same	7
0	this item works perfectly with my samsung blackjack the sound quality is exceptional the only problem is that the clip to attach to your shirt tends to fall off	7
1	i bought these for use on my ipod earbuds i had an old pair \( they were green \) that worked great but i lost one within minutes of putting them on the earbuds they split open all three pairs ! if you 're planning on using these for your ipod headphones look into the older colored ones i believe they 're a different material and less prone to cracking	7
0	the compatibility with nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in bold letters within the title it says quot universal 2 5mm jack quot universal meaning all 2 5mm jacks not all cell phones know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review great product	7
0	these cases were not available when the pearl hit the market we were able to get them from this merchant good quality item at a great price thank you	7
0	the only complaint i had about my a900 was the battery life i am on conference calls a lot and use my bluetooth headset which tends to drain the battery pretty quickly with this extended battery i am able to use my headset without having to charge the phone repeatedly totally worth the 15 plus it arrived in about 4 business days with standard shipping	7
0	these are a delicious and nutritious snack ! my husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious the all bran bars are great too keep up the good work kellogg	8
1	this bar would be great if it was n't so full of sugar it gives me a sugar headache	8
1	this stuff tastes great but after doing some research it 's got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy the first item on the list \( which means that it is the highest mass ingredient \) is partially hydrogenated oils if you have any problems with cholesterol i suggest talking to your doctor or maybe you might want to be like many americans and just increase your lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers godspeed	8
0	i am a big fan of coffee other than water it 's all i drink so when i found this i had to run with it it 's cheaper than red bull has more power than it it 's better for you than red bull and it has a nice flavor that does not leave an aftertaste my frig is stocked with as i type !	8
0	after reading that bentley 's has the finest ceylon teas in the world i decided to give this as a christmas gift to my husband he says it is the best tea he 's ever had and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur i would consider that a compliment the box is beautiful and it makes a lovely presentation	8

0	all the splenda products are good but i like the ones that are part splenda and part sugar as they are good for baking good if you have a diabetic in the house or are trying extra hard to lose weight and are a sugarholic	8
0	i have used this product for a long time as lipton has always been a trusted brand i do go through a lot of tea so buying it on amazon was quick and more affordable then other stores	8
0	my mother absolutely loves this tea it 's the only kind she will use i received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where i could purchase more and they told me they do n't sell to the public my mom was very upset i then went on to amazon \( which was great for all my christmas shopping \) who put me in touch with bently so my mother had a wonderful christmas ! ! !	8

0	i used to have a hard time getting my kids to eat fruit until we tried the just tomatoes products now i have a hard time getting them not to eat the whole tub in one sitting to have a picky eater eat all the fruits from this company is amazing to me i love them too great for a quick low calorie healthy snack	8
0	i bake 3 4 times per week and honestly can say that this product is great i tried it for the first time to make bread i almost cried my bread was the best i ever made i will buy it again for sure	8
0	this instant oatmeal is the only one i have had that tastes like real oatmeal it does not have that artificial taste that most instant oatmeals have	8
1	the product is fine but the description is misleading each package contains 40 count that is 40 filters but this is not a \( pack of 12 \) as you would think from the description from the price reduction \( from 23 88 to 1 93 \) and from the shipping weight \( 4 20 lbs \) it 's just one box of 40 filters and you 'll pay as i did 11 for fedex to bring you this one box soon after i submitted this feedback i was issued a partial refund of 7 product description still needs correcting but at least customer service was responsive	8
0	great taste and value ! it taste best with a high quality honey ! a must for tea drinkers	8
0	the product if reviewed just on taste would only warrant a two but the convenience is worth a five it is probably the best la briute product that i have found it is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable but it is way too salty	8
1	this product is way too salty i did n't like it at all and neither did any of my family you ca n't get the taste out your mouth either after tasting one	8
0	these might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar they are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame flax and sunflower seeds i'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis i highly recommend oh i have ordered both from nutiva and from amazon amazon is less expensive and faster delivery	8
0	if you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink zico it will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium i have recommended it to others and it always works pat rampolla	8
0	my wife loves strong coffee this is the only k cup that did the trick for her makes a good bold cup of coffee	8
0	this is real italian espresso the best you can find on the market if you have an espresso machine and know how to use it then you got it made rich flavor and sweet at the same time i 've known this product all my life growing in italy excellent the very best	8
1	i thought i was getting a mix of some sort this is just an expensive condiment	8
0	this pasta is very good it works great in salads casseroles or regular pasta dishes i 've only been gluten free for a few months and i think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta granted i 've only tried one other kind of gluten free pasta \( made all of brown rice \) but this pasta is far better and i like it enough that i feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds	8
0	this jerky is not just an excellent value it is by far the best jerky we have eaten i buy it every year as christmas gifts \( and ofcourse save one pkg for us \) and everyone raves about it my family always looks forward to christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays you ca n't beat the price and the jerky is actual strips of lean beef that is flavorful the brown sugar has just a hint of heat with the sweetness i would highly recommend this product value and quality ca n't be beat a thanks !	8
0	it is so good to taste popcorn that tastes as if it were taken right out of a pot of boiling water buttered and salted to taste the smell of corn on the cob runs throughout the house great summer smell all year long	8
0	the dried berries arrived promptly and in good condition we thought they were moist and tasty	8
0	these cherries are large and plump and may need to be chopped for your recipe	8
0	i really like this cereal by nature 's path it is very good and tasty however i just found a new favorite which is the zen version with cranberries and ginger i highly recommend both of them though the optimum has more fiber and has a completely different taste then the zen so if you need to change it up go for this one too	8
0	my husband and i like the newman o 's better than oreo 's and our 3 year old son loves them ! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo also the newman o 's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	8
0	if you have ever had trouble with leg cramps be sure to drink zico it will relieve your cramps almost instantly probably because it is so high in potassium i have recommended it to others and it always works pat rampolla	8
0	faster than expected shipping ! great tasting product and good for you too	8
0	this is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch the last bunch i got wasnt as enjoyable as i was used to i realised it was because it lacked crunch would buy it again though great guilt free snack great for kids too	8
0	i'm a huge white tea fan and regularly keep more than five varieties at any given time clipper 's organic white tea with peppermint is easily one of the best of any type of teas the flavor is balanced well defined and makes for smooth sippin	8
1	i have to second the other reviewer 's comments about the partially hydrogenated oil that kellog 's is using in kid cereal ! \? ! \? it is the year 2006 time to start making these cereals healthy and without trans fat ridden cheap oils ! ! ! !	8
0	hardley any bad ones in the whole bag i bought these through figis and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them plus they cost more	8
1	in amazon 's ultimate wisdom they will not return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in beta status i ordered the apple cinnamon in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone i 'd avoid the amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards	8
0	the first thing you notice about this cereal is the aroma it 's reminiscent of fish oil supplements having never eaten flax of any kind before i do n't know if the aroma is typical of flax at first serving i was sure i 'd consume the rest of the box \( eventually \) but would not buy more yet with each serving the aroma is less and less noticeable i enjoy this cereal and will buy it again it has more fiber than any other cereal \( organic or not \) i 've seen	8
0	i enjoy this cereal with vanilla rice milk it is good especially when i eat it which is what i do	8
0	tastes very good in my oppinion and in the oppionons of two of my friends who tried this product too not exceptionally great \( hence the 4 stars \) but good enough to enjoy eating big pieces of meat and plenty of it plus it 's all natural including the beef which was not from hormone fed cows which is also important in my oppinion would buy again	8
0	this has the perfect blend of sweet and salty combination without the guilt	8
1	i can hardly eat this for all of the salt it leaves you thirsty it 's so bad the ingredients list reads literally 100 organic sweet corn sea salt and nothing else they need to make it 100 organic sweet corn and nothing else and they 'd probably have something really great as it is i'm stuck with 23 1 2 bags of salty corn that i 'll have to give away	8
1	while i personally love and eat tons of organic and natural foods i have to say the 30 i spent on this case of cookies was a waster neither of my children will eat them nor will i they have a smell that once you get in your nose hinders any attempt at enjoying the very small bit of flavor they have nature 's path makes great cereal and energy bars but fall short with these cookies stick with the chocolate or peanut butter and you are okay the honey grahams will sit in your cupboard until trash day	8
0	i bought a few bags for my husband along with other brands we are looking to buy bigger quanties of tubi 's this licorice is simply the best wonderful taste of licorice not over powered with anise but wonderful molasses true licorice	8
0	the variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee i 've had in a long time i drink up to three cups of coffee a day but the one i look forward to the most is the cup i make in the morning on my senseo machine the origins pods are the best of the best these pods have a rich full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available get the variety pack and try them all they are all wonderful	8
0	these airforce drinks have reasonable flavors and clear attributions as to their ingredients additionally they seem to provide a little nutritional support beyond the comfort provided by functioning as a polite treat i like this mandarin mint flavor the most but all are pretty good the small red bull style cans look chic in the refrigerator and are a lovely rather special no trouble hospitality offering for guests and visitors	8
0	hearty great tasting cereal has a whole grain flavor originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals \( which is better for my reduced carb diet \) but it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through amazon com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores	8
1	highest quality wholesome ingredients my aunt ida seriously how do companies get away with this nonsense \? \? \? the first ingredient is corn syrup followed closely by sugar that the harmony line would even consider masquerading as a healthier foods company and then try to pawn off this rubbish it 's revolting i say do n't buy from them just on principle yours the food zealo	8
1	sickly weak queasy stomach after eating the bar for 4 hours or more i havent felt so yuky and sickly in a long time you cannot return these or any food items to amazon the coconut was moist and tender yet no good flavor taste smells of cheap food grade oil the spirulina is too try and chalky too much dried spirulina in one bar again bad taste no good alive flavor spirulina and cashew coconut agave nectar elisha elishachristian earthlink ne	8
1	i ordered these and received less than 300 some of the packages had holes in them and melted bags i contacted the supplier and they did nothing to resolve the issue i would not order from them again	8

0	this is a deliciously smooth tasting coffee rich flavor and no acid stomach ! i 've had a hard time getting it locally and amazon has saved me	8
0	my favourite tea in loose leaf form it just does n't get any better than this the tins are a good size \( not so small that it 's gone after four cups of tea but not so large that it 'll be stale and moldy before you could possibly finish it \) that fit nicely in my desk at work as well as on the counter by the teapot the tea is fresh and flavourful with the quality i 've come to expect from twinings	8
1	i had the exact same experience as heather shown below they sent me the less expensive non organic version of this product twice and then informed me that they could n't guarantee when the problem would be fixed remember that strawberries and cherries are on every list for crops containing the most pesticide now add that freeze dried snacks are concentrated finally take these concentrated levels and place them in a small child or toddler 's body and their pesticide exosure goes through the roof do the math note to amazon this is a great product with fruit and nothing else in its ingredients please retain it and get it right to benefit the scores of us that enjoy providing healthy treats for our kids	8
0	i am a huge fan of tea i have been drinking this one for years i am astonished at the price such a great deal anyway if you must buy tea in a box this is one to purchase i love the subtle flavors of this tea i always feel better after drinking a cup it 's even better if you add a little fresh \( organic \) lemon juice	8
0	add mayonaise to anything and i love it that is espcially true of this white albacore tuna being packed in water lowers the calories and it 's fat free but it needs something to moisten it like mayo it 's delicious and totally clear of any dark tuna meat if you abhor even the slightest amount of dark tuna meat in your salad the tuna are supposedly wild caught in dolphin safe nets so are therefore hopefully lower in mercury content plus there is nothing added to the product so it 's truly all natural i happen to like dark as well as white tuna but if you only like the white like so many of my family and friends then this is the brand to buy	8
0	these are slightly thicker than regular gluten cornflakes but still tasty do n't expect them to be sweet like frosted flakes they are just plain very good though and great in recipes	8
0	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
0	i am addicted to this green tea ! it has the smell of passion fruit i have to have at least 1 2 cups a day great buy ca n't find it at all stores and it cost half the price on amazon	8
0	this is a terrific espresso i got hooked on lavazza in italy and have n't found any other espresso blends to knock it off it 's throne this is my first time purchasing lavazza whole beans and i think i 'll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor would highly recommend !	8
0	this is one of my favorite cereals ! it appears to be nutritionally superior to the heritage o 's and less crunchy the only downside to this cereal is that it does n't keep me full for long i feel like an hour later i'm hungry again i 've combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power an upside to the 'downside' is that this makes a terrific between meals snack ! i have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne	8
0	this is very good coffee and is one of my favorites the moca gives it a little different flavor but it goes well with the dark roast beans i have purchased this item several times and would recommend this product to others	8
0	i just began baking with splenda when we found out my dad has pre diabetes for easter i prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with splenda and it worked beautifully everyone agreed that it did n't taste sugar free and my dad really enjoyed it	8
1	bought dozens of different varieties of these all arrived way past expiration date and were terribly stale do n't chance it i'm not the only customer who has had this problems with these products	8
0	i hesitate to write a review about a food because well one man 's meat is another man 's poison i like the not too sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand the banana flavour is our favourite the fruit and nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds \( so maybe too minimally processed \? \) also remember that 'all natural' is not organic even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store our local target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it	8
0	i love twinings but 300 packets of it are a bit too much to purchase at one time there needs to be an option for smaller packaging with this product	8
1	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
0	gluten free diets can be so much more varied with this product it can be coating to chicken or meat or can be added to juices broths to thicken it can even be used to make a perfect stuffing for chicken or turkey it has make my boring diet almost feel normal no feeling of deprivation any more	8
1	although i love the nana 's brownie mint and peanut butter flavor cookies i found the ginger cookie disappointing it was too spicy to be enjoyable and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors \( the crumbliness is due to the gluten free rice flour \) also the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors i 've had 360 calories per cookie compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories note that nana 's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving but they count a serving size as half a cookie	8
0	you have to use this product a special way to appreciate all it does for you it is very good for the body i tried to eat some right out of the bag but decided it is best to put it in other food items like homemade cookies or my applesause good stuff	8
1	my sister worked at starbucks so i used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion i have a pump espresso machine but only a cheap blade grinder which should tell you that i'm only about mid range on the coffee snobbery scale that said i prefer the starbucks espresso to this in spite of the drastic difference in price when i buy it retail again though i'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much i only know what i like the taste of in fact i only drink it in lattes 4 shot lattes but lattes none the less	8
0	i'm placing my second order for the variety pack because i liked every flavor and appreciated the variety all have a sensational blend of flavors spicy sweet salty without being overpowering truly delicious and healthy munchables i'm so glad i decided to try out a package in my supermarket	8
0	this is my favorite of essn 's juices it is unique and has a beautiful color which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails also a huge hit with kids ca n't beat 100 juice worth every penny	8

1	it 's easier to make one from scratch and you electricity bill wo n't skyrocket	8
1	i drink all types of teas but this is one of the worst tasting teas in my opinion	8
0	we bought these because there was an online coupon for them my children \( ages 11 and 14 \) take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices the price was right and with the free shipping when going over 25 it was hard to resist the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor they are a nice change and we 're really enjoying them	8
0	this is simply wonderful licorice with an intense layered flavor my dad 's a long time licorice fan and this stuff gives him a big smile so he 's getting a four pack for christmas ! great texture great flavor great price	8

1	t may be expresso grind but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker think again bitter when drunk on own marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino i shoulda known betta	8
0	we really enjoy the crackers just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of august 2006 and the expiration date on the product of november 10 2006 feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case amazon needs to let the consumer know what the expiration date is so you can make decision as to whether to purchase a case or not otherwise they are great crackers	8
0	i love swiss miss cocoa especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack the milk chocolate is great the rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate semi sweet to darker flavor and the marshmallows are just cool great for the wintertime stock up and enjoy also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee get the sweetness of cocoa and the kick of coffee got me through a few late nights	8
0	if you love the taste of peanut butter then you will love the taste of these granola bars they are chewy and do not break into pieces while eating them a healthy delicious and quick snack	8

1	i was disappointed with this product i love dried fruit but this product is overly sweet and does not have much strawberry taste they have a strange smell but not a nice strawberry smell they are very dark in color and moist from sunflower oil simple dried fruit without the oil and fructose additions would be much nicer you should also know that this food product cannot be returned i would have sent it back in a flash if i could have	8

1	it is a quick meal when you need it but hopefully you wo n't need it too often i guess you ca n't expect too much from a two minute meal but it would be nice if you could expect more than this it is an easy kosher meal when you do n't have a kosher microwave	8
1	ingredients high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oil do a search and see what you think i wo n't touch this stuff	8

0	i love the taste of this hemp protein powder i love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the nutiva hemp seeds it tastes great and satisfies me on every level i also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands i could n't believe when i saw that there was 14 grams per serving considering that 90 of americans are lacking in fiber this protein powder can be a great service to millions	8

0	this is the second time i 've bought these for my dog although they are not dog treats my dog loves them she is very special to me so i get her the best this is a great price for these slim jims if i buy them in the store i pay alot more for them i 've tried them also their very good they come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time just like the ones they sell in the stores if you buy them one at a time at 25c a piece you pay 25 00 dollars for them i think this is a great value !	8
0	excellent taste and texture the apples are the crunchiest but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture if you really like your crunch i 'd go for the all apple product my only disappointment is that you 're not getting a lot for your money i love the convenient portion control packaging but 1 10 for a 3 4 ounce 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon so i 'll order more but these have become an occasional snack and not an everyday one	8
1	i purchased diamond pecans in their shells in december '06 \( note not these already shelled ones \) and discovered after the kids were eating them that they were all rancid be sure and check the dates \( if you can there were n't any on the in shell nuts \) because there 's not much worse than ruining whatever you 're trying to make with rancid nuts i have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where i can smell and taste them	8
0	this is decent rice with a lemony herb flavor that is pleasant it 's a bit heavier than fresh cooked or frozen rice but works great in a rushed day	8
0	i have been using the navitas natural organic raw cacao nibs for four months now and it gives me a feeling of happiness well being and energy for the day we add it to our fruit smoothie in the morning i do n't eat chocolate with dairy and sugar as it gives me pimples however i can tolerate the nibs	8
0	i love my tassimo ! for years i have been searching for an economical and convenient way to replicate starbucks lattes and mochas at home and this is the system that finally achived it i do n't use the latte capuccino milk pods unless i'm in dire straights it 's better to steam real milk \( search for milk steamer on amazon that 's a great product too ! \) but the espresso is great and i have n't been to starbucks in weeks hands down recommended no holds barred	8
0	i have ordered these twice now they taste so good ! i also tried the chocolate wheat free ones they were awful i would not order them again but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked	8
0	illy rules my favorite espresso roast great price excellent	8

1	i would love to have the above item actually really wanted it so much that i called about it twice both times i was sent 6 oz packages of pecans that i could have \( but probably would not have \) bought in any store my husband is extremely fond of the canned pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line i do n't have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others sorry but i 'll have to really research the product before i order again ms judie cardwel	8
0	i love kashi stuff and this bar is no exception there have just a greattaste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying wheneaten between meals highly recommended	8
0	what can i say about lavazza that has n't already been said i was in rome two summer 's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets decaf is usually not so great but this is they must be doing something right	8
0	excellent green decaf tea at a great price we love this tea it has a strong delightful green tea taste and its decaf too by comparison many other green teas are too dry tasting for me and i like the convenience of the 40 tea bag size boxes as we drink a lot of this tea its great hot and good iced too	8
0	these bars are terrific very moist unlike many other snack bars they are quite tastey and my kids really like them too	8
0	though resembling nothing like the common graham crackers found in most grocer 's cookie aisle these small squares are quite delectable and relatively guilt free	8
0	these are a perfect size for work and great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
0	my husband who has celiac disease thinks this is the best bread on the market it definitely is the easier to make only requires oil and water and turns out perfect every time amazon 's price beats those health food stores by a long shot ! try it	8
1	i picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that pirate 's booty was a great product these tasted rather odd to me and i wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just do n't go well together in my opinion it might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste but that was not the case here	8
1	i have been an avid senseo fan for about a year however i was getting a bit bored drinking the same dark roast every morning \( i found the other flavors too mild \) so i was very happy when i saw the new flavors \( sumatra colombia kenya and brazil \) sumatra and columbia are the two that i liked i found the kenya blend to be mild and sweet even my wife who previously used hazelnut did not like it too much	8
0	i first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them my daughter is allergic to soy and soy free crackers are very hard to find i bought them and to my amazement my picky husband also loves them ! he prefers them to all other similar crackers i purchased a large number of boxes \( which i keep hidden \) as they tend to disappear rather quickly	8
0	this is the best crumb topping i have ever made i got rave reviews for my christmas pies and it was so easy cause it was already made for you just add a few things and done what a pleasure	8
1	i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids 4 iron and no other vitamins \? \? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories \? \? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast ! ! ok organic coke but still coke ! ! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species ! ! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children	8
1	i accidently picked these i really wanted the hot fries these just are not as good i guess if you like cheddar they are okay	8
0	beautiful and easy to use ! the grater stays sharp after many uses and guests always ask about it i wish it came with a dish to put the salts in it would make a great gift if it came with a decorative dish	8
1	this product was so disappointing that i discarded the entire box after trying one bar there are much better raw food bars on the market in terms of both nutrition and taste	8
0	i love these snacks especially the valdosta blend the others are good but lack the crunchy punch of the valdosta it 's a great snack or salad topper delicious and good for you	8
0	unlike the december 2006 review and much like the most recent reviews there 's not much in this soup other than very small bits of seafood and some potato i'm thinking that 1 \) the recent quality has gone downhill or 2 \) the december 2006 review was a plant anyway the taste was okay but it definitely does n't rate up there with legal seafood \( which i 've had at one of the restaurants and at the boston airport both much better than this \)	8
0	orange pineapple has been my favorite flavor for years when it 's out of stock at my local supermarket i go out and look for it it 's the best	8
0	i happen to love pecans and this product is loaded with them it 's too bad the cans are so small	8
0	as anyone who has tried bahlsen hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name a nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream just a sidebar no detraction from how tasty these cookies are	8
0	finally a gf cf granola ! this stuff is amazing ! i got it for my husband and daughter \( 2 \) who are gf cf but i love this stuff too ! and i am truly not a nuts and seed person but i ca n't stop eating it ! i'm so happy to be able to give my daughter a snack that has such great protein in it and is so easy to eat ! my husband is just going to keep a bag in his car to snack on	8
1	i ordered the chocolate mint variety amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly however i ordered the cookies in early november and they arrived with a best when used by date of december 4 2006 they will expire less than a month after they arrived ! i'm not sure if this is amazon 's fault or not the cookies are shipped in the manufacturer 's back to nature box so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on amazon com	8
0	this spread is way too good ! my husband and i have both tried spreading it on toast but it really stands alone i like to eat it just straight out of the jar the spread is a perfect blend of flavors if you have a sweet tooth and do n't always have other sweets on hand a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings unfortunately this spread has no nutritional value to speak of so i doubt i will order it again 6 jars is plenty for us you have to order it at least once though !	8
0	i recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak i purchased the loose tea leaves from amazon at a good price quick shipping english friends suggested pj tips \( \? \) tea which we found ordered from another online site twinning 's blows it away both the earl grey irish blend are great both on the pallet to the nose	8
1	i am sensitive to wheat gluten and i swear this product has gluten everytime i eat a bowl of it i get sick i bought tons of this cereal because it does taste good but now i do n't know what to do with it because i ca n't eat it i think they must process this stuff on the same equipment as other wheat cerel somehow it is getting contaminated i wish i could send it back it is too bad because it is a good product it 's just not gluten free	8
0	these are the best banana chips i 've ever had and the dried cherries are a great combination ! i would highly recommend this product	8
1	i have been buying stoneridge orchards products for a long time so i decided to try the variety pack for quick snacks not only the product seems inferior to their regular packages but also the pouches were half open in the box what a rip of	8
0	this product is packaged very nicely for keeping it has good flavor without health harming corn syrup used sparingly there is very little downside to this product	8
0	this is one of the best tasting teas i have used keeps well in the refrigerator for two days retaining its excellent flavor i reccommend this tea to everyone and have shared with many family and friends	8
0	i do not like store bought cookies especially oreos \( too dry and greasy for me \) but upon the recommendation of several people i tried the ginger o 's and was pleasantly surprised they have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it if you like ginger cookies do n't hesitate to try these	8
0	i have been drinking starbucks espresso but decided to give this a try i am so glad i did this is by far the best espresso i ever had and yea even better than starbucks	8
1	please be careful i did not read the product description so i do not know if they mentioned this but kava can cause severe liver toxicity even without prior liver damage please consult your physician before taking this or any other supplement ! thanks	8
1	i was trying these as a change of pace from the turkey jerky i normally eat they taste ok \( nothing special \) but several of the medallions \( in at least 3 bags so far \) had 'crunchy' bits in them i suspect it was gristle or possibly small bone fragments not pleasant to eat i may have just gotten a bad batch \( other than the crunchy bits i 'd give these a 4 star rating \)	8
0	excellent product amazon 's prices were very good a few months ago however now the price is more than the popcorn costs in the grocery store	8
0	this is a good granola i like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things and a few nuts tossed in nice taste thanks to amazon for carrying so many gluten free items ! makes like so much easier ! !	8
0	timothys coffee is my favorite ! and the 2 packs boxes is a very good value	8
0	some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat and if you are one of those spelt flour makes a great bread it substitutes well but be aware that spelt requires less kneading \( it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long we knead bread about three minutes \) spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes it seems easier to digest it does have gluten and is a relative of wheat so if you are gluten sensitive this is probably not an alternative	8
0	by far the best no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels worth every penny	8
0	the kids love 'em and what could be better than that \? i bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here we tried the strawberry frosted and like other reviewers i agree not too sweet right amount of frosting ca n't wait to try the next flavor	8
0	if you dont like mangos you will not like this drink it does not taste like an organic mango but rather it tastes more like the essence of mango you would smell from an air freshener this does mix pretty well with cold rum i would suggest you find this brand locally to try it before you buy it this water does not taste like the water you would get from the asian countries i cant really explain why either	8
0	i use this cereal for not only cereal but also to make rice crispy treats yum	8
0	anyone following a gluten free diet knows how expensive it can be to buy the gluten free version of anything and when trying a product for the first time you hope it actually tastes good this is one gluten free product i am completely delighted with both in taste and price these corn flakes are crunchy and delicious \( i like them better than the glutenated alternatives \) and work well for other recipes candies cereal crumb pie crusts fried chicken etc	8
0	i'm not exactly sure how good these are for you \? \? \? but i do know they taste great ! ! i bought these because i never have time for breakfast in the morning and i'm also sort of a choco holic and these with coffee or better yet hot chocolate are excellent !	8
0	i did n't know tuna could taste this good ! and low mercury relieves worry about eating too much fish i love shopping amazon i experiment a lot and am never unhappy but this tuna is really wonderful	8
0	another viva la rice ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture ! i do n't know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work camping or to have at home	8
0	this snack is superb in several ways first it is very good tasting the flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie nutritionally it has quite a bit of protein very very low in simple carbohydrates \( or sugars \) and is high in fiber i carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine these would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip	8
0	these bars are filling which is what i look for in my snacks breakfast foods they 're nice and sweet wo n't fall apart on you like granola bars yet do n't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite it 's the perfect consistancy a great way to get some portable protien if you do n't want to carry around a bag of nuts seeds with you	8
1	as another viewer pointed out this product contains corn syrup not at all organic in fact the only organic thing in this product is the fig for those of us trying to maintain a healthy organic eating lifestyle you must read the list of ingredients before assuming the front label is accurate this goes for all products not at all an attack against paul newman products which my family does consume we enjoy their products that are truly organic	8
0	my children love smart puffs i love the smaller packages for school lunches	8
1	i normally buy special k cereal i found these boxes to be stale	8
1	i thought this might taste like parmeson crisps you get in restaurants i was wrong they taste burnt and are hard to swallow even when chewed thouroughly also still had quite a bit of sodium	8
0	unusual and fresh tasting i really really enjoyed these nut blends i will definitely order them again	8
1	purchased these for my sons lunch box and ca n't do it they are too salty he 's always been happy with veggy booty and that is what he 'll continue to get	8
1	worst tasting nutrition bar i have ever had and i 've probably tried over100 different kinds this one tastes like soap	8
0	since i love kellogg 's fruit harvest with strawberries and blueberries ithought i would try this one it is good but not as flavorable as kellogg 's it also has a nice mix of berries which includes raspberries as well as strawberries and blueberries you ca n't beat the prices forboth kellogg 's and golden temple in the supermarkets amazon is the wayto go for the best prices	8
0	i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best the taste great are really crunchy a key requirement for me and have just the right amount of salt the newman 's rounds are just as good maybe even better and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity an unbeatable combination in my book	8
0	everyone loved these pretzels very flavorful not too salty i plan on buying more from amazon best price i 've found on this brand	8
0	the coffee was very good i just wish they had more items to select in the variety pack i'm still looking for that one flavor that says this is it i had a superb coffee in a local restaraunt and i 've been trying to duplicate that taste for a couple of years now	8
0	i 've purchased many of these products i put this in my top three good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick	8
1	sorry guys i do n't know if i was n't tasting real miso soup at my local restaurant but the thing is i did n't like this one bit and i still have lots of packages left ! haha i gave it a chance because i love the soup from the japanese restaurant i visited and i wanted to taste this soup whenever i wanted at home but i did n't like the flavor do n't know if i'm missing something but better buy one \( one \) a see for yourself	8
0	we enjoyed this coffee however decaf may still contain some caffeine i was watching a news report about disturbed sleep studies and the medical staff at the center stated that not all caffeine is eliminated in decaf good to know if you have trouble sleeping or with the jitters	8
1	i love most jack links jerky products however i was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat the flavor was lacking true pepper taste it tasted like a bunch of powdered old hot spices not a true fresh pepper cure i think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste i have not given up on jack links just ordered their turkey jerky	8
0	this is a great tea and very economical when buying bulk from amazon i'm very happy with it	8
0	i 've been using agave in my tea coffee cooking and on pancakes for over a year i'm a type 2 diabetic and need something with a low glycemic index this product is the best and it tastes wonderful my kids do n't miss honey on their pancakes any more and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes highly recommend	8
0	i was introduced to these when i bought a can at a big lots store and found that they were so good that i went on line and bought a case i highly recommend this brand to anyone liking sardines stan re	8
0	i love this mac cheese it has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac \( warm and gooey orange cheese \) but without that vague chemical aftertaste it tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just no food in the fridge \( you do n't even need to add milk to this ! \) my favorite comfort food when i'm sick	8
0	of the several brands of agave nectar that i have tried this one is by far the best it has the least taste to it it is just sweet \( very similar to simple syrup that you would make with sugar and water \)	8
0	i'm a vegetarian and although my husband is n't he enjoys this soup just as much the tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture if you 're expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed however if you 've made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time saving substitute the tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals this soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach my local health food store charges 5 30 per box of 4 packets amazon sells it for 2 66 a box substantial savings	8
0	i love these cookies too ! they 're crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that does n't feel waxy in your mouth the lemon taste is great and they 're not too sweet they 're a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but do n't want to overdo it with calories or sugar the box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get but the taste is worth it	8
0	flavor is very good the reason i could n't rate it higher is that i have trouble getting it to thoroughly mix in	8
1	ok so pretzels are supposed to be salty but these are a tad too salty they also have a burnt flavor you could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order on the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good this is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first \( instead of buying 12 bags \) also note grocery items cannot be returned to amazon	8
0	best damn earl grey on the market the bergamot is well balanced with the black tea flavor still good even if the bag is left in for 'too' long buy this tea	8
0	my kids love mashed potatoes these are sooo easy no melting butter just add hot water we love to have these as a midnight snack just add shredded cheese and some sliced green onion and ummmmmm good would have given them 5 stars but they 're not quite as creamy as hoped	8
0	these crackers are great for the natural health conscious family as well as anyone else who loves goldfish or other cheese crackers they taste great and are all natural with organic wheat nothing weird you can actually understand what every ingredient is ! \( how refreshing \) plus i love this new big box 12 oz instead of regular 7 5 oz not only does it save packaging and cabinet space but it 's a better price per ounce ! great for us because we go through them so fast now that these are available here i also do n't have to go to the store \( some of my local stores do n't carry the big size anyway \)	8
1	overall the nuts were soft and lacked the flavor we had hoped for for the price we could have done better	8
0	my family prefers the blue agave to the lighter colored and sweeter agaves we use it to make raw truffles \( sooo good \) and on top of pancakes and waffles cereal rice pudding etc we had no problems with shipments leaking so far	8
0	i think my title says it all of course the packaging is not recyclable but it is at least minimal by today 's standards this is a lot of cereal for one person so i hope it has good shelf life	8
0	i love orville redenbacher 's sweet buttery there is no other popcorn like it i'm a little upset because they took it off the self in jersey city if i ca n't find it i will buy kettle corn second best	8
1	we are huge scone lovers and were absolutely disappointed with the taste of these scones the mix was easy enough to assemble and bake but the scones have a decidely odd smell and very caustic after taste my husband who will eat just about anything threw the whole batch in the trash after trying his first one we had high hopes but sadly this product just did n't deliver	8
0	these are great our vegan golden retriever seems to love them \( and is very healthy \) the cows pigs chicks are pretty darn happy she 's eating veggie treats the treats are organic and newman 's donates the profits to charities ! now that 's a win win win win ! i only gave them 4 stars since the bags are so small and cause a lot of packaging waste which newman 's should be well aware of \( why should we have to buy 6 packs of 10 oz bags instead of 30 oz or 60 oz bags \) \? when that 's resolved they 're getting 5 stars from me	8
1	these were the absolute worst crackers i have ever tasted if styrofoam could be served in a box it would taste like these save your money	8
0	i'm not a huge coffee fan most of the time i find it bitter then there 's the whole language you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints but occasionally i do feel like i need that little surge of energy this kona blend coffee is the perfect choice it has a lot of flavor but none of the bitterness i find in a lot of other coffees this is the one i put in the coffee maker when i plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis it makes great iced coffee too	8
0	this is my favorite cereal ever since i started eating only organic i picked this up one day and i love it i eat it every morning for breakfast	8
0	these are the best ! they remind me of rice crispy treats they 're so chewy and delicious i recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products	8
0	i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea ! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste with the splenda there is none ! you can use this to cook with too ! it 's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar	8
1	way too sweet for beef jerky it was similar to drinking a soda	8
0	we love this cereal it is nice and crunchy and it does n't leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes i definately will buy this again	8
0	i am a true fan of all things ginger and this tea is wonderful very warming and spicy	8
0	the granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet however the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing it has a crunchy texture the manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste the prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive 12 bars go quick i recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk the bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage the bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid morning and later in the day	8
1	my product should have been delivered a month ago this is very bad buisness to think that you can ship something whenever you feel like it i am a paying customer that should have been reinbursed in some way for the mistake that your copany made	8
1	kind of fishy tasting with a few potatoes floating in it along with a few green herbs not worth the price its not awful but not great eithe	8
0	i have purchased this item several times it is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken it comes packaged well and is easy to prepare it is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me	8
0	as with all newman 's own products you find great quality with what you 've purchased and also good value paul newman has given over 150 million in thousands of charaties worldwide since the establishing of the newman 's own line one box of these raisins is 130 calories with zero fat cholestrol it 's a good healthy snack to have around and enjoy from time to time	8
1	donot buy it i got the stuff even past the expiration day	8
1	i wanted to like this bar because it 's high in protein and fiber but it is also unfortunately high in added sugars \( 31g ! \) it 's much too sweet if they took away some of the sugar it might be edible	8
0	if you like strawberries you 'll love crunchies ! only 98 calories per pouch i snacked on one pouch all day and did n't finish it off ! very convenient resealable i have other varieties on order !	8
0	i started to love annie chun 's udon soup in march 2007 although it was on my amazon grocery list for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great i just ordered many a chun 's soup noodle bowls and i will order more again in future annie chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on amazon com	8
0	these were absolutely delicious i bought them as a treat for my co workers they disappeared very quickly we could n't stop eating them and will be ordering them again they are not shiny covered almonds like we were expecting rather they are hand dipped in a lot of very good chocolate and have drizzles over the top and a flat bottom edge very fresh taste	8
1	although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes drinks our experience is it wo n't dissolve without a blender simply put it clumps the taste is fine actually good so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement	8
0	just tried this granola today it 's really good ! the packaging is also great just like a milk carton no broken bags or messes to deal with and really easy to pour this granola has the perfect blend of grains and just the right amount of raisins	8
1	the price for this and all other 100 calorie packs is for one box this means you are paying almost two dollars per ounce this is the most ridiculous sham i have ever encountered the difference in price between this item on amazon and this item in a grocery store is outrageous \( this costs over ten dollars more here than at the grocery store ! ! ! !	8
1	this bar would be great if it was n't so full of sugar it gives me a sugar headache	8
0	and i 've tried quite a few i tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup and this one takes the crumpet ! the flavor is strong but mild the color golden brown and the aroma is light i threw out all the others \( or rather i gave them to my father in law who also like tea \) when i found this one and i bought a case of it	8
0	i tried to order this here but was sent tang instead when i informed them of the problem they resent the order and again i got tang their system seems confused by the tangerine description or they 're just not very bright at the warehouse i 've had this flavor before and it is good not too sweet and a bit tart refreshing	8
0	i doubt if most kids would like this bar but health food fanatics will love it subtle flavor mixed with chocolate bar is very filling dry use with water	8
1	this is the second batch i ordered i have had to contact representatives at brucepac both times to complain about the quality of the product and they have kindly send me replacement jerky i have enjoyed the same world kitchen jerky from other vendors so i cannot understand why the order from amazon has been such a disappointment	8
1	my wife and two year old like this cereal however i find them to be extremely crunchy and unpleasant to eat i prefer the purely o 's just wish they came in an eco pack	8
0	these are the best almonds i 've ever had though it is true that the amazon ad states they are all natural \( an error on their part not on emerald \) they are very close to it the pricing here is a bit high at our higher end market i pay 5 49 for an 11oz canister the pricing is better to buy at the store than through amazon overall but if it is convenience that sways your buying preference this comes fairly close \( about 7 8 higher \) i do highly recommend this brand	8
0	i'm happy with the product and the swiftness of the delivery for sure i will be ordering again very soo	8
1	very sad to say that this is salty no i mean salty ! will try something else for my son annie please make these less salty and i will try them again	8
0	all 4 of mine love these they are great for a quick snack on the go or to pack in lunches when in a hurry	8
1	my tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six i called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six that is all i ever received and my money was refunded do n't really know what happened never got an explanation from the distributor	8
1	do not buy crunchies products in the hot summer months they are heat sensitive as the packaging states important store in cool dry area the two cases i purchased arrived chewy and clumped together they probably cooked during shipping and are not a raw food and not as nutritious anymore two of the bags were more bits and powdered fruit clumps than chucks of fruit and one was opened amazon com does not accept grocery returns it was a waste of 40	8
0	seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix ! one canister makes 40 cups of broth which makes it incredibly inexpensive it 's also delicious it makes a truly versatile soup base people love my nabeyakiudon \( japanese noodle soup \) matzoah ball soup \( jewish dumpling soup \) golden lentil stew \( indian bean stew \) all of which have seitenbacher as the base it works for people with allergies and food sensitivities \( no gluten no lactose no msg no soy \) it 's all natural and vegetarian \( no gelatin \) and i ca n't emphasize enough the rich deep flavor	8
0	love this great substitute for shortening keeps baked goods moister and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables	8
1	i purchased two of these packages in mid jan 2007 i have only finished one box \( of four \) and am finding about 1 out of 4 packets have caked due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in \( only my personal theory \) i just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem and they have known about it now for a long time seems like they would have solved the problem	8
0	we have served this coffee at our sunday morning church services for 8 years it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from pura vida but helping children and families i heard one visitor who moved out of state and had not been in services for over 3 years say i knew i would get a great cup of coffee this morning ! we love this coffee	8
0	this mac cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt very good product overall	8
0	the opportunity to get twinings earl grey in large containers at a very reasonable price was too good to pass up	8
1	i have been disappointed with this product we have always enjoyed annie 's products have never had a problem until now the cheese was so solidly clumped that i was unable to make a sauce without lumps i have used 3 different packages from my order have had the problem with all of them i am not sure if it is the result of a manufacturing issue or if they have been sitting on a shelf too long in the warehouse either way beware	8
0	i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice you shall not be disappointed	8
0	the back to nature graham sticks honey are delicious ! they are a great tasty snack there 's no way you can eat 'em without a cup of milk not because they 're rich but they 're a little on the dry side i still like them so much that i quit buying them at the supermarket started buying them in bulk	8
0	these are a great deal cost 2 75 per box they are 3 99 per box at our local grocery store they are also very tasty and a healthy snack our whole family loves them i worried about buying a case just seemed like a lot but they are going fast and if you are box top saving people there is one on every box ! so they are good for schools too !	8
0	excellent one of the few food items i 've found on here that i think i 'll buy again remember that it 's best chilled ice cold if you 're ever gonna sample it not so good when not so cold great when actually cold very refreshing feel either way though after you 've had a drink	8
1	i was excited to get these but did not read the ingrediants before purchasing big mistake to me they are far too sweet and almost sappy tasting i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some of those chewy snakcs they make for kids the high fructose is insane and really i feel they would be better off with a fraction of what they add	8
0	they 're a quick fix and they taste incredible best protein bar around	8
0	my wife and i have slightly different tasates in coffee i like mine darker and she like a milder coffee this one however is just right for both of us i drink it daily without cream or sugar \( which i only do when i actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee \) and we are on our second 5 pound bag ! i wish we had found this coffee sooner it is great	8
0	of the gloria jean coffees mudslide is my favorite good taste when used with the keurig b70 and the 9 25 oz size brew i am on my 2nd order over 50 k cups made and have never had a misfire the previous reviewer simply had a bad batch	8
0	nutty taste this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings	8
0	i bought some nana 's no refined sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale they were so incredible i looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon and bought some here these cookies taste fantastic and they are very moist as well really all of the flavors i tried \( choc chip coco chip and oatmeal raisin \) were outstanding	8
0	i used to love just corn but i like this brand even better i agree they could cut the salt a bit but i think some salt is a nice compliment to the corn	8
1	peculiar unpleasant taste with an unnatural texture after trying one package it was so bad that i had to throw out the rest of the case a waste of money	8
0	this is mine and my husbands favorite tea it has such a smooth satisfying taste we have tried about all the earl grey teas and this is the best we ca n't always find it so when i found it on amazon i was elated being able to buy it in the 50 count boxes \( pack of 6 \) was just what we were looking for and we will continue to buy it here thanks amazon	8
0	i feel better serving this mac cheese than all the others out there no artificial colors or flavors and it tastes great ! cheese sauce is on the salty side so i throw a bit of my own pasta in with the shells to cut sodium content	8
0	this is a great product and was better then i expected i needed a large quantity and working through amazon was great i was a little disappointed in the packaging because the box was basically open due to poorly placed tape but being able to track the package was great	8
0	this product is great ! very refreshing it tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut it does n't have any added sugar it 's only 60 calories a serving i just wish it were cheaper	8
0	these cookies are superb all by themselves far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more keep out of reach of children	8
0	hain popped corn cakes are simply delicious just enough crunch and sweetness to satisfy my hungry teenagers very healthy too	8
0	better beef jerky is not to be found anywhere shipping was good and it made alot of people happy at christmas time	8
0	i take these to work along with little minature milks i pick up at the convenient store they 're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine and they 're not too bad for you either considering they 're all the sugary cereals your mom complained about when you were a kid in fact the one with the highest calorie count \( 280 \) is the rasin bran and that 's something that would actually be considered healthy all the rest fall into the 160 220 range	8
0	did n't expect much with the price being this low but it 's now a family favorite ca n't tell the difference between this and jeremiah 's kona blend but they are both have smooth rich tastes it 's one of our family favorites now	8
0	this is truly great jerky and a fantastic price do n't let the price fool you this is first class jerky i order for the whole office and every person raves my last order was for 36 bags of world kitchens \( some of all 5 flavors \)	8
0	i was n't sure about this as i normally buy green tea it is a very pleasant tea it smells great and is light	8
0	if you like almonds and cruchy granola bars these bars are for you they are higher in fat than i would like them to be but they are delicious great for a quick breakfast or snack there are 2 bars in each packett and i usually eat one for breakfast and then one later for a snack	8
0	great taste ! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste the reason why your \( to the previous reviewer \) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine if you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer these are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees	8
0	this fox river rice pudding rocks ! quick cooking and you can adjust the consistency as i prefer it to be fluffy as opposed to creamy the cinnamon stick is a nice touch although i would not recommend this product for those of you on a high fiber diet \( like myself \) to lose weight as the overall fiber content is low it is a nice treat that is low in fat and is extremely delicious	8
0	we have been using meyenberg 's powdered goat milk for several years we used to buy their milk in cartons at walmart and it was good the only problem was that we live so far from a walmart store that we would run out of goat 's milk between trips we decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk	8
0	its a shame they quit carrying it i would have reordered twice by now	8
0	the love at first sip pods brew a very good \( but small \) cup of coffee in the melita one cup coffee maker the directions say that you can use the pod for two cycles \( which would fill a large mug \) but that is only if you enjoy your coffee very weak this pod and system is perfect for people who only drink 1 2 cups a day and hate the waste and inconsistancy of a self measuring system	8
0	my whole family love these crackers it 's nice that they are organic with no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils the only thing i wish is that they were whole grain !	8
1	maybe i'm daft but i ca n't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine i 've tried tamping them which does n't work well and i 've tried just placing them in the filter in both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso as with other european products \( think ikea \) there are no printed instructions in english just line art drawings perhaps i'm just doing something wrong i like the concept of pods but i 'll stick to beans instead	8
0	about to order my fourth box this year it makes a smooth brew ideal for my latt	8
0	ok i eat a lot of protein fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse this bar is the best i eat it for breakfast lunch or as dessert after dinner the texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat seriously love it	8
0	ever feel like you want that little something with your tea or coffee but you abstain because you 're on a diet \? that was a problem for me at least i 've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight well just when i 'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative along came dr kracker spelt muesli crackers ! they are all natural contain no white flour or sugar do have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea ! highly recommended	8
0	you wo n't want anything on them either ! they are that good warning be prepared for quite a number of broken and crumbled crackers from the shipping	8
1	it 's not the regular strong earl grey twinings i come to love this version lacks strength and flavor two teabags are needed for regular strength tea it 's even states on the box light flavour strenght \( 2 leaves out of five \) beware !	8
1	this stuff tastes absolutely terrible ! steer clear and do n't be mislead by the texture review below yup the texture is great but it the taste makes you gag it definately is n't worth it	8
0	very tasty coffee cake probably does n't cost much more than to buy all the ingredients to make it and easier ! ! ! nice weekend treat ! make sure there 's lots of people around to eat it so you do n't eat it all yourself !	8
0	we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but do n't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something this is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot i also feel good about buying newman 's products because of the causes they support and all the money does n't go to corporate profits	8
0	this is one of my favorite teas this is 1 2 the cost of my grocery store and since the bags are individually wrapped freshness is not an issue	8
0	i spend a lot of time in my van while out shooting wildlife photos i buy a case of bottled water and keep some of these individual packets of drink mix open a bottle of water and put in a packet of this drink mix and you have an instant refreshing drink very easy	8
1	these are fine if they were n't supposed to have blueberries there are essentially none most pouches of the 24 do n't even contain a piece of blueberry when you do find one it 's a very nice taste with the peanut but sadly that 's very rare avoid this variety	8
0	these are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket and they are worth even the higher price do n't worry about buying too many with the six pack i was a little concerned about that when i bought here a few months ago but my wife and i ate all of them easily i'm not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves but in these euro style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor	8
0	i too totally disagree with the other reviewer who did n't like this this is a mild tasting smooth tea that you could drink anytime it is one of my favorite teas	8
0	this granola is delicious being that it 's gluten free is a bonus since it 's so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet but my family can eat whatever they want and they could n't stop eating it ! the cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies this is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack	8
0	i had read other 's reviews about how great this coffee was but i was using another coffee that i thought was really wonderful i tried this one and now i am hooked it is wonderful if you like bold coffee which i do i also like the fact that it is organic i do n't drink a lot of coffee each day but the cup or two i have i want to be great just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee	8
1	i am always looking for quality nutricious treats for my teens i bought the samplers to see if anyone had a favorite sorry to say that we just did not like any of these a little too spicy and we were looking for crunch and got chewy	8
1	i ordered a 12 pack of this broth and so far i 've received a total of 3 bottles 1 original order and 2 replacements amazon still has n't sent me the 12 pack and now instead of correcting my order they want to cancel it and refund my money i 've been on and off of hold for over 20 minutes and they still have n't helped me i strongly recommend you find somewhere else to buy this product	8
1	i ordered the corn on the cobb popcorn since i could not find it in phoenix anymore it tasted just like regular buttered popcorn in the past the popcorn literally tasted like corn on the cobb my family fought over it ! not anymore !	8
0	great substitute for high fat potato chips good amount of soy protein \( 6g per serving \) excellent flavor good crunch and texture these are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet no trans or saturated fats my wife and young daughter who do not need a low fat diet as i do love these woohoo	8
1	why did they have to add coconut to these snack bars \? they would have been great without the coconut and now i find out i ca n't return them and i'm stuck with them if you want them let me know i 'll trade you for some decent granola bars	8
0	the wife looked incredulous but i had the last laugh as i pasted a beefy juicy kiss of sugary goodness on her cheek last night just as she was dozing off to bed seeing the drooly goo drip off onto the pillow made the night on the couch all worth while thank you world kitchens for two pounds of steer delight	8
0	this is good and healthy it is not too sweat and not too healthy tasty it is just perfect for me	8
0	they taste like graham crackers and are great portion control ! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it if you are counting calories this is the way to go	8
0	pacific foods beef stew is wonderful for hot lunches at work inexpensively the all organic ingredients make the pacific foods very tasty and filling ! way to g	8
0	love this stuff great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well no after taste at all	8
0	my 2 1 2 year old is allergic to foods very common in traditional granola type bars wheat soy nuts we have tried various bars that were safe for her to eat and this has been by far her favorite ! i'm happy that they 're organic she loves the taste great all around they are individually packaged which makes them great for when we are on the go	8
1	these were horrible i thought i 'd try raw foods and i amde a big mistake	8
0	as a vegetarian you can use this is many ways as a meat substitute	8
0	these are a fun little snack they taste good and are crunchy so you can pass on the potato chips they have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins they are not low in calories so be careful of the amount you eat my daughter likes them which is a plus the price was good at amazon but the shipping was steep	8
0	i am addicted to wasa crispbread multi grain and you will be too very crisp and hearty flavor a healthy product with no saturated or trans fat and only 60 calories per portion the other wasa products are also worth a try especially sesame	8
0	you definetely gotta own this after an 11 years break from the music scene seger 's back full force already 400 000 copies sold more info on bob at	9
0	not as epically gorgeous as 'once upon a time in america' but still lovely there 's a south american influence that lends a very fresh sound to the entire soundtrack my favourite track is an ave maria in guarani haunting however gabriel 's oboe is the theme that makes this score being an oboist it of course holds a particular appeal to me and the oboe performing the theme is really something to be aspired to	9
0	the album is straight raw kurupt 's lyrical abilities are unmatched and go hand in hand with daz 's delivery the g funk beats are the best they 've ever sounded as a whole you will not skip one song at all a	9
1	do n't waste your money this album is cheesy sounds like a million other pop rock songs and is nothing compared to their earlier work with donnie van zant and max carl on vocals all i have to say is they need the old lead singer back ! the guitar work is ok but the classic 38 special sound has definitely been lost	9
1	if you are buying this because you love rob be aware this is the rob wearing his goblin cock hat if you are n't familiar with this incarnation let 's just say it ai n't the rob of pinback or heavy vegetable fame same guy different sensitivity i fell in love with rob because he seemed to make sense out of all the nonsense out there on this outing rob has met the enemy and it is himself he 's entitled to do as he pleases and you and i are entitled to not care for it this cd is not an acquired taste it is a forced feeding	9
1	i am a huge fan of btnh but even i will admitt this is not a good album the worst being home which uses samples from phil collins the whole thing feels kind of empty with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works there are a few songs worth listening to most notably is clevland is the city which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any harmony to it other songs worth mentioning are what about us not my baby and pump pump the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage it is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released	9
0	okay bryce nickelback yells not screams big difference and wtf sum 41 your kiding right sum 41 does not scream at all and you say i like music well you dont know any thing about music and another thing you poser is that limp bizkit is not metal they rap so how can you say that they scream all the time limp bizkit is the worst band out their they give a bad name to music itself and as for you dont write anymore reviews until you know more about music wich with the information i just got from you that will take a long tim	9
1	i knew this would n't be the sia from zero 7 's album little did i know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents zero 7 have behind the mixing boards the song production is terrible i could n't find one song i really liked on this cd sia truly has a unique voice but it 's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight still i'm severely disappointed particularly because i had to pay for this cd as an import	9
0	this is one of my favorite releases from common this chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers songs like i used to love h e r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks this is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone 's collectio	9
1	nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst and how dare him to diss krs one he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number 1 he just added to why he sucks lets face it all his songs are basically dumb and and really don t have much texture involved and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable if you buy this album you throw away good money unless you like bubblegum rap this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool but lets face it its played out	9
1	2nd time	9
0	no collection of blues rock is complete without quot a piece of your soul quot there very simply is not a weak track on the entire disc from the raunchy \( quot bitter rain quot \) to the uplifting \( quot good day for the blues quot \) to the bittersweet \( quot cynical quot \) to the soft \( quot share that smile quot \) storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique put this disc on your list of music to have on a deserted island	9
1	i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they 're funny heh so witty anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy but there are a couple of good songs on this cd notably grand theft autumn and saturday those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho 2 stars	9
0	some of the catchiest melodies and harmonies ever from curt lots of cool instrumentation pete anderson did a great job with the production this has n't left my cd player since i got it 4 days ago	9
0	i was looking for some music i could play in the car or around the house with my 19 month old son and came across this one the exact same album that i had when i was his age ! i'm so glad they redid it ! one of my fondest memories	9
1	this album is pure crap ! just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from straight outta cashville until he can make a real new album not this microwaved crapola if you like buck get straight outta cashville an beg for mercy than wait for his future release with actual new tracks i strongly advise you not to buy this it is a total rip off i wasted my time downloading this	9
0	top to bottom this album has it all makes you laugh makes you think makes you want to dance i ca n't wait till mainstream finally catches up and the music industry finally recognizes what a gift todd snider is and the talent he posseses his music will inspire you to move something whether it 's your brain or your bottom ! check him out	9

0	first of all bob dylan is certainly not for everyone however if his style is up your alley this is a classic you can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like lay lady lay or like a rolling stone to name a couple planet waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully this is probably my favorite dylan album and i have all the classics like blonde on blonde blood on the tracks highway 61 revisited ect i 'd recommend this to any dylan fan	9
1	i'm an avid tony yayo fan but this album just did n't cut it maybe its just trying to commercialize in the rap game and having pressure i do n't know but i listened to most of his mixtapes and this album sounds nothing like them hopefully his next album will be way better a few songs are good to listen to i would think coming out of prison you would have a lot to talk about but so seductive being your first single \? \? come on i am not a hater but just listen to the album and then listen to the gunit mixtapes and you will see what i mean rating c	9
1	this cd is garbage juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album he was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one if i was you dont listen to the retards who tell you this is a good comeback album instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend welcome back by mase that is a good comeback album the only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of mannie fresh juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats a shame they could n't go to ja rule whose cd sucked with his beats he has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow	9
0	this album has morse code on it what more can you say well some of that morse code actually sounds like that ua6 you just worked on 40 metres complete with t6 buzz and slow drift and the music is pretty good too	9
0	i used to listen to a friend 's copy of the original metal box of ep 's when it first came out years later the second edition came out on lp 's for those of us who had n't sprung for the metal box before it sold out eventually the second edition came out on this cd so i finally could own a digital copy myself pristine audio quality at least as good as the original metal box in my opinion if i remember correctly you do need to listen to this you do need to buy a copy and get other people to listen to this too	9
0	never mind the fact that jay introduced the jazz world to charlie parker his band rocked ! after basie nobody swung like mcshann this 2 dis set covers the big band sides and the later 40 's small band jump blues sides anything by this man is worth listening to another great disc by the proper label who release wonderful compilations with informative booklets at a bargain price highly recommended	9

1	we read all the previous reviews and thought this disc would be a keeper we \( my husband three kids 14 10 and 5 \) tried it on a warm spring evening in the car one or two songs like the banana splits speed racer and scooby doo were fun most however were harsh and too fast for the parents and youngest guy i would rather try these songs in their original state and skip the covers	9
1	man can she get anymore stupid and talentless she needs to spend some of that undeserved bling bling on some singing lessons than her skimpy outfits all the songs on this album are totally unlistenable ! she completely lacks power vocal range and versatility jennifer lopez represents everything that is wrong with music today she gets a recording contract because her good looks and success with her acting career just because your a great actor actress does n't necessarily mean you can sing too some actors actresses were able to achieve it but not jennifer lopez she needs to quit the music business while she still can please stick to acting oh wait ! i forgot she ca n't do that either !	9

0	alvin lee is a genius with a guitar nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the blues he was and is a great rocker but his true calling is as a bluesman this is a great album	9
1	sinceramente no puedo entender la devocion de muchas perosnas incluso renombrados artistas hacia este musico ungido de la leyenda grape amparado en el descontrol y la libertad absoluta que encierra la locura esta coleccion de temas no genera mas que sentimientos encontrados lastima piedad curiosidad no se me genera igual sensacion que muchos discos de erickson \( 13th \) en ningun momento se me revela como la creacion de un genio en fin son opiniones nada mas	9
0	this album is absolutely beautiful the full musical sound and talent of calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of iron wine make the perfect match it 's almost unheard of that i love every song on an album but this one makes the cut each song wraps you in a warm trance a coccoon of well being it has a really positive emotional effect on me it creates an ambiance of gentle strength wonderful i really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums	9
1	if you 're looking for billie in her prime look elsewhere all the music on this cd was recorded between '45 and '47 after she had lost her voice look for the classic recording of strange fruit from '39 on one of the other cds available	9
1	a friend of mine turned me on to spoon and at first i listened enthusicatically but then i got bored although spoon 's songs may be catchy at times they are empty and deviod of any alterations the same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so but in the end i do n't think i 've ever listened to an entire track if this is 5 star music today our culture is severely lacking depth	9
0	every listen i get more into this cd many catchy songs i now need to buy more of donald 's solo stuff great music	9
1	unless it is rock and roll played by ac dc i f ing hate them they are overplayed so much on the radio and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life do n't waste your money on this cd just turn on the radio then turn it off	9
1	i own all of bebo norman 's cds and i love all of them except for this one i bought it and listened to it once and i hated it it does not sound like bebo this sounds like steven curtis chapman or michael w smith or any of the other mass produced christian pop music artists on all of his previous albums even though he changed his sound slightly it was still generally very acoustic and bebo ish this album sounds nothing like his previous music i was disappointed	9
1	i love destiny 's child but this cd big disappointment the best songs on the entire cd were probably lose my breath cater 2 u and girl big disappointment i just wasnt feeling the cd when i bought it	9
0	no other compilation of garland 's work exemplifies her genius and versatility than this astounding compilation that shows why she was the entertainment phenomenon that took the world by storm all her original soundtrack performances are here sounding magnificent far superior to thin sounding studio re creations this is the real deal assembled with obvious skill intelligence and dedication to the talented legend in a sense this should be the soundtrack album for that magnificent documentary about her that pbs produced a while back do n't pass this up	9
0	chris joss delivers some serious blaxploitation inspired grooves that will wisk you back to the times of bell bottoms afros and platform shoes ! joss' you 've been spiked is a retrospective piece of marvellously produced tracks that pays true homage to an era that gave us some of the funkiest music ever ! in fact this music sounds so authentic you would think they came straight out of the 70 's but it 's all circa the 21st century it 's good to know that there are still modern cats \( especially on the esl record label \) who know how to recapture music from days gone by	9
0	if you do not yet own dark side of the moon wish you were here and the wall do not even consider purchasing a momentary lapse of reason amlor is junk by comparison that said very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three and amlor certainly has its bright spots learning to fly and on the turning away are as good as anything pink floyd has ever produced some of the other songs are adequate but this album does not contain the front to back brillance of the earlier floyd releases it 's definitely worth having but make sure that you have the others first	9
0	this cd is a classic a must for all those who loved the movie i wondered if i would get a crackling type of sound but it is as crystal clear as the movie sound this is perfect for those who want to practice the songs for a sound of music event or a singing class !	9
1	i bought this cd for one song quot walk away quot which was one of their best known songs i was hoping since that particular song was so good that maybe the album would harbor a few more gems there was n't the rest of the album is like an anti climax i would suggest a greatest hits instead if you see this cd just turn your pretty head and walk away	9

0	i love this cd ! everything they sing about is so true to life it 's a great arrangement of songs	9
0	i have both the quot heat quot and quot seduction quot cd 's by oscar lopez and listen to both of them with wonder this man is magic i have about 20 quot new flaminco quot cd 's and these are right at the top as far as my tastes are concerned oscar if you 're listening i check at least once a month for your next one	9
1	nana has a beautiful voice but her singing is monotonous predictable she lacks passion sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of really interpreting the song in addition to this the arrangements are unfortunately very poor her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with candles but this is not the album i would like to listen to again and again	9
0	i'm a bit surprised by the negative reviews this cd is amazing it 's not anything like soundgarden or audioslave but it 's amazing none the less every song on here is beautifully written and as always cornell 's voice does n't disappoint it 's different but one of my new favorite cds	9
0	this is by far the best psychopathic album ever released riddlebox is now in second place madrox schools ever other artist on psychopathic with this album beats are bangin' and lyrics are flawless ! great flows and he mixes funny with wicked best songs are this b tch and hey phatty great album by the best rapper of our time madrox is so under rated i wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in the process buy this album best rap album ever made	9
1	this is anything but soothing the tone is too high pitched nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky carmel coastline that i was hoping for i did buy the twofer and got the ocean surf cd by dan gibson and found it much more relaxing even though it is n't a tumbling surf sound i was able to fall asleep which was my goal now if i could only return ocean waves	9
1	john mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low but he is still a professionaly trained monkey i mean musician mayer along with artists like gavin degraw teddy geiger etc are todays n'sync and backstreet boys nothing more	9
1	the cd came as promised and in the condition promised i'm very satisfied	9
0	this album is a great representation of what spoon is about great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one 's ears spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind the two sides of monsieur valentine sister jack and i turn my camera on i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock definately money well spent	9
1	you win some and you lose some this purchase was a definite loss what a dissapointment	9
0	this is a cd that everyone should have ! there are four great voices and they do country music the way it should be ! lorrie morgan is the best and i like everything on this ! ! buy it and enjoy ! chery	9
1	there is at times a fine line between noise and music nin not only crossed that line in this cd but stomped on it a few times in the process not even close to the calibre of with teeth this cd is a waste of time and an insult to the talent that resides within this group of musicians songs that go from semi music to irritating noise and last four times as long as one can abide while playing the same thing over and over and well you get my drift if great music is your thing pass this one up or write me a note and tell me why on earth such a great group would release such an abomination	9
1	do n't think dale can play a song the same way twice did n't like the selection of songs nor the way they produced	9
1	there was only one good song on the disk dont waste your mone	9
1	this album had two good songs at the most ralph was good with new edition it 's apparently obvious that he ca n't stand alone bobby should have been the lead for new edition then we may never have seen this terrible album ralph is n't that good of a singer this shows that just because your the lead singer in a group does n't mean you are the best ralph is miles behind bobby	9
0	sing of mary is a work of art ! the beauty of the music is only surpassed by the woman it praises mary ! god bless this cd	9
0	wonderful instrumentals and lyrics a shenandoah lullaby is simply beautiful i love the way the ending segues into brahm 's lullaby his version of arkansas traveller is refreshing teddy bears' picnic is a quaint song that few people have heard there ai n't no bugs on me is my two year old daughter 's favorite judging from the way she belts out this song and giggles from time to time i like all the songs on the cd a breath of fresh air for parents who prefer real instruments to synthesized pop	9
0	this album gives me goosebumps i got it because of eric dolphy but there is a lot more to listen to on this album than eric dolphy alone \( though he 's excellent as usual \) the inclusion of booker ervin gives the album the perfect texture as his style in many ways contradicts that of dolphy although the styles are different they complement each other perfectly mal waldron is a great composer and many of his most excellent ideas appear on this album the song thirteen is a fine example you 'll just have to listen to it everyone on this album smokes get this you wont regret it	9
0	though i am only 33 years old i grew up listening to bob wills merle haggard did a great job with this one \( as he always does \) i got goose bumps listening to it it took me back to my childhood when i would sit on the porch with my grandfather listening to bob wills the only thing missing is the scratching of the needle on a nearly worn out album	9
1	pls tell me tat tis boxset is a joke ! ! ! ! classic rock reo romantics bangles \? \? \? its more like classic new wave only thing good would be the price pls who ever the a amp r people are pls pls design something bette	9
1	i should first state that i am a huge ej fan his music has been extremely important to me over the years he is without a doubt a genius i would go so far as to call him the mozart of our times but elton can also write bloated self indulgent tripe and if you ask me this album belongs in that bucket i give it 2 stars just because of ssmlt one of his all time greats i never cease to be blown away by that song but the rest of this album \? booooooring ! ! !	9
1	i ca n't believe some of the songs on this soundtrack they are horrible pieces of s ! \? ! ! there are a couple good ones but its not worth spending the money on for the c d not even at a used price i ca n't believe they did'nt put low rider on the soundtrack how cheap is that	9
1	you 'll find better works out there particularly if you 're a miles fan the emphasis here is on milt jackson and his vibraphone which gives the album a light airy feeling missing is much of miles' horn and sentiment you also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music i would call this a quot pleasant quot album which in my jazz world is not a happy thing	9
1	jj the name of the song you are looking for is like you like an arsonist by paris texas	9
0	tom delonge is at it again with a new band and a new album even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from boxcar racer angels and airwaves managed to have a completely different sound they dropped the more punk rock tone of boxcar racer in favor of an emo alternative style of rock the first released single the adventure is quite enjoyable and even though i have n't checked too deeply into it i think it 's the theme song for nbc 's studio 60 besides how can you go wrong with an album that 's gone double platinum in the uk and gold in canada	9
0	i have been a fan for jaci velasquez for the past eight years and enjoy hearing her voice in both languages i do not speak spanish but enjoy her artistic abilities none the less this album lived up to the velasquez name in my book my family and i only really enjoy the traditional sounding christmas carols and tend to not enjoy the revised versions jaci 's album not only made sure the carols were sung traditionally but she has given us a gift a couple new songs that will be added to my christmas traditions ! overall i love this album and the only reason i did not give it a full five stars was that i am done with that chipmunk song sorry everybody	9
1	actually garth hudson the former organist of the band does not play on this cd \( nor 'every geriatric rockstar 's' \) the musician you might be referring to is al garth ex of loggins messina	9
1	it was awful ! the reproduction of the music was grainy scratchy and virtually impossible to listen to	9
0	i discovered this album some years ago as i'm workin' in big music stores i 've got the opportunity to listen to so much music well ! ! this album is a very difficoult one to find in a record store nowdays and every time i have it in stock i play it straight away and some customer who listen to it buy it instantly blakey and potato are swingin' so much in those quot salsa like quot rithms mobley is as usual with art blakey and k d in such a great shape givin' a wonderfull touch to evry note he plays basically one of greatest blue note of all time !	9
1	who could like a band like the rolling stones \? they are not the world 's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but start me up and shattered their new album is the most horrible cd i have ever heard stay far away from that cd get anything from the stones that contains start me up or shattered insted	9
1	after souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums \( a feat achieved by only a handful of bands \) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc the bunnymen built their reputation on moody psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in ocean rain for this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory eschewing album wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach unfortunately these lightweight songs do n't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned if you 're new to the bunnymen you 're probably better served by checking out their first four albums \( crocodiles heaven up here porcupine and ocean rain \) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts evergreen and flowers	9
0	this is a fabulous cd and exactly what i was looking for i'm also thrilled that it has an accompanying book with all the sheet music i am leading a seder this year for a church group who has never heard any of the songs before so i wanted the traditional melodies easy to follow sheet music and easy guitar chords this is perfect ! i'm so pleased	9
1	the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music and do n't think that it 's good just because your kids might love it kids also like to eat mcdonalds but do n't try telling me that their food is healthy there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children and surprisingly a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children even with the expletives deleted there is no reason on earth why these records should exist excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative seriously do n't buy this !	9
1	the raising arizona part of the cd is almost exclusively electronic and only one 90 second track of the great banjo that i remember from the movie i recommend listening to samples before you buy	9
0	my son loves music and really likes dan zanes we started with the videos on disney and the catch that train song really got us singing so we ordered this cd now my son sings along with it dances and jumps around dan zanes really is fun for the family	9
1	yo nu mixx sux i hate when people make cd 's like this to make some money off of great artist like pac this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan they take great songs and make crappy beats get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money	9
1	thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he 's a dumb phony who does n't know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money ohyeah he dose n't even scratc	9
1	apart from the great selection of soundtracks what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing executed with finesse these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited fuller versions like singing in the rain for example throw in the great price and this double disc set is a must have for all lovers of classic movie music	9
1	i was disappointed by ms jackson though it 's not such a big loss b c i did n't pay much for it none of the songs jumped out at me thank god i did n't waste time putting this on my ipod why upset it	9
1	perhaps it 's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations but i was really disappointed with this recordthe songwriting is weak the singing is weak and the arrangements are dullsomething kicked all the life out of the music the songs are not all the same but for some reason they all sound the same and embarrassingly you can sing most of them after one listen they are so simplistic and cliched	9
1	i found the music rather annoying it was not what i expected at all	9
0	this cd is a must for any horn player or lover of the instrument ! cerminaro has tremendous technique and extremely sensitive mucicality en	9
0	i am new to ron sexsmith where have i been \? this cd is outstanding and so soothing the instrumentals are soul syrup the melodies are whipped cream and the lyrics are full of cherries nuts and fudge sauce it is putting something so sweet and so nurturing into the hearts and minds of the hungry and starving i am still in the stage where his songs resonate in my mind just before i fall asleep at night and that waking up means i get to hear his comfort food again this honeymoon will last forever fall in love folks it 's worth the risk calorie free i promise thanks ron god speed !	9
1	on the track cleo 's mood it sounds like something that bookert and the mg 's along with the mar key horns would 've cut it sounds like steve cropper on the guitar and booker t jones on the keyboards the sax style is definately jr it 's a soothing piece	9
0	in the early 60 's etta james was to r amp b what patsy cline was to country she could cross over and yet remain true to her roots and that 's only one part of a nearly 50 year career ! from the velvety cross over soul of quot at last quot to the hard driving memphis soul of quot tell mama quot this is one legend who certainly deserves a wider audience than she has today she ranks right up with aretha franklin as an influential vocalist i took far too many years to discover her power if you have n't given her a serious look yet stop wasting time and begin here	9
1	as you might think i am not a die hard fan of jmj i think that when only die hard fans rates an album it makes you think that with such a high rating everybody should love this album and this is not the thruth not everybody like this king of musical experimentation some do but some do n't i like oxygene and equinoxe and even after all those years they are still good to listen too rendez vous offers some really good moments but we are far from the perfection as oxygene or equinoxe rendez vous is easier to get use to that zoolook is but we are far from a near perfect album that 's all	9
1	lonestar did n't really surprise me with their 2001 effort i'm already there and not a day goes by suffers from amazed syndrome amazed 's 1999 multi format mega success is spread all over this album their wanting to sound like every '80s heavy metal band power ballad did they listen to monster ballads 2 too much while making this album in nashville \? i'm already there comes off as very diane warren ish in its sappy lyrics their wanting to be diverse as a country band is okay but these songs do n't work for them these songs are just complete fluff and their other songs are far better than this	9
1	something that someone who claims to be country should not do even though these girls are already pop remixing it to make it even more pop was a huge mistake ! then again they have to do something to sell more cd 's ! lol ! !	9
0	i drive alot commuting to and from my job this music has served as the perfect backdrop to an lovely indiana fall ! i'm sure i 'll recall those colorful images as i continue to listen to this cd through the colorless days of winter	9
1	people this is easy listening at it 's easiest every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years that is if it is n't allready i do n't know anything about what they have done in the past except for a song i remember being played on the radio a few years ago must have been on the album prior to this but that song sounds just like two tracks on this one not only that but if there was n't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests i could n't really tell any of them apart horrible music with no feeling or soul not even creative do n't waste your time with this	9
0	i loved this album strangely enough i was introduced to the title song by gray 's anatomy where i just had to find out who was singing that lead \( alice russell \) the rest of the album is like the r b music i grew up with definitely worth a listen	9
0	other than that this is a proper introduction to the heavster	9
1	however despite what amazon reviewer kristy martin may believe ms croft does not need to get her freak on wow i guess hip hop can do no wrong in a soundtrack which is filled with apporpriate trax to supplement the film here comes another fanboy girl of hip hop 's hopele ley misplaced garbage thank you kristy for proving to be yet another white suburban supporter of the most mass marketed crap to come along \( missy \) this song is soo done it 's practically taboo to listen too and outkast \? puhf ckingleez these clowns sold out a long long time ago	9
1	i ca n't believe i just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten \( ten ! ! \) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit by the third version my brain turned to jelly by the fifth i needed a drink by the final re mixed version my hangover already started to set in this e p is for dj 's and masochists only tom rya	9
0	we bought this on cassette in washington dc on our first day of honeymoon in september 1997 having flown from northern ireland it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from washington to nashville along the skyline drive down through south west virginia across eastern kentucky to berea and down to smoky mountains national park in tennessee we are from an ulster scots scotch irish background and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that our forebears had settled in so many centuries before bringing thier fiddles and folk songs with them creating what was the core of mountain old time music and bluegrass from the carter family right through every song is a classic you must buy this	9
1	chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions nicks latest attempts have been pathetic from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he 's doing these days no we 're not saying recycle the older productions but instead it 's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions a signature if you will and hey it does n't have to pigeon hole you if done with class yes how the mighty have fallen oh brother	9
0	i found this cd by browsing amazon and decided to give it a try i am happy with all of the tracks some tracks remind me of beatles a little but not all so the band does have a unique sound even though from the 90s the sound is like many bands making it today i like it	9
1	the music for the soundtrack was so lame ! i though i was gonna cry cause i figured this was the end of b2k by this point the s'track was n't even all b2k either i like the song with jhene and omarion happy also i liked out of the hood other then that it was boring	9
0	my one complaint is that after i listen to this cd the catchy tunes get stuck in my head ! and then i want to keep listening to it more and more i love the selections on this cd the fact that the songs are in english \( i always wondered what the figaro figaro figaro song was about ! \) and that a little background is given to each piece as well	9
0	sorry ya just ca n't replace michael hutchence this is a great overview of all of their greatest hits i am not a huge fan of greatest hits cds b c people tend to buy them and therefore miss all of the excellent songs that were n't released as singles all inxs cds are worth buying separately but if you must this will work	9
0	i love this cd ! i often put it in my personal cd player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as i study french the music is relaxing but not sleep inducing steven halpern composes great music	9
1	great cd imus in the morning recommended highly and the i man was not wrong one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years i listen to a lot of buffett james taylor delbert mcclinton and this cd places high in these ranks	9
1	quality is poor some songs are not playing avoid buying amazon	9
1	this industry is goin down u call this an album \? \? \? lo	9
1	i was so disappointed with this cd at least 6 of the songs were recorded from very old albums scratches and all ! they were so bad i play two of the songs over and over the only two i liked when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song i was wrong i do n't know why they had to add the scratchy music a filler \? i would quickly skip to another song only to have to skip many times !	9
0	i love jazzy hip hop of the early '90s and if you do too this is the album you must listen to ! all the songs are wonderful but there are some of these which are something of supernatural like the famous \( and the most beautiful of the entire cd ! \) award tour steve birko \( stir it up \) and midnight enjoy this pearl of real hip hop ! ! !	9
0	of course no jazz musician can pack the energetic wallop that dizzy could his trumpet can only be described as hot and hearing his music makes you think of people dancing their legs off with garbage cans burning all around and smoke in the air this man 's music has life in it unfortunately the real energy to dizzy is in his latin jazz work and a more complete compilation of that style would be the compact jazz series ken burns' collection here is more versatile but just not as lively as dizzy 's music can be proceed with caution	9
0	i bought this cd since my sister had stolen my original copy lol need i say more	9
1	ok avoid this at all costs not worth your money ! ! ! ! as luck would have it i found it a a garage sale the only track whorth listening to is track 12 which is vivi 's theme from ff9 the others well they could have done better most of the songs are to put it nicely suck \( at least the way they where done \) the only reason i rated 2 \( 1 1 2 to be accualy \) is because of vivi 's theme at the end this is not whorth your time get the imported cd 's they have much better music on them	9
0	link this cd of great melodies with the best of the browns \( 1954 1967 \) you 'll not regreat the quality such easy listening this group is simply the best i also suggest reading maxine brown 's book looking back to see a country music memoir it 's a well written \( and interesting \) cover of the the history of the browns	9
1	i said i was going to be honest in all reviews and yes i kinda clunkered on this one i hate this cd simply put they ca n't sing and the songs are boring i'm sorry i bought this cd and other people might not like me saying that but it 's my opinion i listen to power metal extensively and there is much better stuff out there like symphony x nightwish or sonata artica do n't buy this though you might like it i 'd definitely listen to it first	9
1	just be sure to read up on this closely it 's not the orchestra you hear in the movie and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts gone are great talents enya and annie lennox replaced by no name voices this is not bad music but do n't think you 're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2 cd set	9
1	yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs girls cars and jewelery i tell you juelz really came with an original formula with this album the stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset lol ! ! ! ! these guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat save your money	9
1	with the caliber of musicians playing on this album i expected a hard hitting original instead we get re arranged covers and lots of filler salsa no surprises here the classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious you 'll play this one once	9
1	i am a huge fan of thomas newman but really this cd presents nothing new it comes across as merely a re hash of the airy atmospheric melody free cues from his other recent scores it has none of the originality of american beauty or road to perdition frankly as much as i like his scores i do n't think this warranted a cd release it 's just got too bland and ordinary no matter how beautifully constructed and pristine it all sounds a pity	9
1	imagine buying this cd after seeing the mirror has two faces fully expecting the soundtrack music to the movie and reading overall great reviews on amazon imagine the shock of receiving the cd and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts the remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse perhaps barbara with her tremendous unlimited wealth felt she would be giving away a free album to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film shameless misrepresentation	9
1	this collection is a must have if you like the bee gees and do n't have any of their albums or even if you do it 's one hit after another plus some i 've never heard which is nice for variety i could n't ask for a better collection it 's like i had burned this for myself	9
0	i have listened to this wonderful soundtrack and i think it is superb ! ! i now know that the alien movies rock ! the tone of the music fits the movie i especially like quot ripleys them quot because it reflects on what has happened with ripley through out the movie the cloning learing remebering and also meeting her clones i would also like to say that the movie was excellent aswell the cast did a great job acting their hearts out jean pierre jeunet should be proud of the music and his film so if you are n't an alien fan you sure as heck will be after you listen to the soundtracks ! jenna	9
0	just loved this cd ! ! ! ! you 'll be singing or humming this to yourself for hours after you hear it if you are 35 years old or older you 'll love it the memories will come flooding back to you enjoy it ! !	9
1	this lifts your heart to god as you listen beautifully done	9
1	wild card is the best song on this cd the rest just did n't do it for me and i did n't care for the latin flavor this cd was a mess if the rest of the songs were along the lines of wild card i would have kept the cd this did n't say rippingtons to me	9
0	i just refreshed my ears listening to riot again ! getting to to hear 1 2 full which clocking in at just over 4 minutes is sheer electric blues magic the price of this album is worth this one rocker alone it was nice to see it on easy street \( along with lukin' excellent ! \) any way this number totally kicks ! definitely get this if you do n't already own it	9
0	a very proud and highly recommended production it 's a real pitty this cd is not available i still have this one as a precious thing i hear it all the time as well as i want nobody will forget jeff lynne as an excellent musician ever	9
0	anybody know the name of the song played at the very end of the movie when the brother and the sister are saying goodbye to each other when she is crying and asking him what he is going to do with his life \? right before he enters the bus i would love to listen to it again but i ca n't find it anywhere	9
1	i was literally horrified when i first put this album in my cd player this cd is absolutly terrible every song sounds like its been composed for some middle school band to play furthermore the songs hardly sound like the songs they represent they 'll go through like one riff from the origional then just do their own thing do not i repeat do not purchase this album i was expecting some cool fun funky lounge music but this cd is just obnoxious the only thing that makes this cd remotley worth purchasing is the cool album art and free coaster	9
0	bought this cd for my daughter a new bill withers fan and she loved the whole collection ! it 's a great compilation of classic bill withers music	9
1	the title says it all they could have put a better group of songs togather	9
1	atleast they are trying this time around still no where near as good as the band was with max pros faster and more back to their roots than the other releases without max at the helm guitar playing is passable cons lack of solos derrick is still lacking as a vocalist just is n't as good as old sepultura songs lack hooks and are mostly forgetable bottom line this album falls short of expectations the current sepultura is nothing more than a very average metal band at best if you like old sepultura i suggest you not waste your money on this but then again you might like it buyer beware	9
1	this young woman has a fine coloratura soprano voice albeit a little underpowered but she simply has no understanding of musical architecture there is too much emphasis on virtuosic technique and no regard at all for musical subtleties in fact i suspect the only reason this little filly was favored over so many of her betters is that she looks mighty tasty in that skimpy frock and short shorts once again sex sells and the vox vulgus dominates at the expense of true art	9
1	kate moss \? that gawddamn rollerskate song \? oh no the spoken tracks are equally repelling there is really no atmosphere to this album	9
1	i cant believe there are so many positive ratings given to this sub par testament release testament must have taken hints from metallica and tried to attract a different audience this is not a horrible album but compared to any other testament album it is easily their worst only the die hard testament fan or those into commercial metal should pick this up	9
0	this has been my first cd of rod stewart and i am very proud to have this cd because worth every penny this cd has class congratulations to the men behind the duet with cher bewitched bothered bewildered is the best song duet with queen latifah as time goes by i was astonish she has a nice voice too ! ! all songs are relaxings actually i listen this cd before to go bed	9

1	i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody \( name changed due to copyright issues \) on their 2006 live album live in canada i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music the vocals tend to be oversung or drowned out by the chaos in the background rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however	9
1	collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage the main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers ! its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again	9
0	vangelis themes is a collection of some rare and some more popular theatrical theme music from movies including blade runner and mutiny on the bounty it 's an extraordinary album and i highly recommend it	9
1	this cd had the makings of a great recording the problem was telling popper where they were performing ! butch please record another one but leave popper at home he 's full of a lot of things but talent is n't one of them	9

1	i received this 2cd set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called mastering i have original un mastered copies of some reo speedwagon albums that sound better than this set ! i love reo to death and the track listing is good to go but in all honesty this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality the band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for i cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close save your money and wait	9
0	if you like vocalese then this cd is for you the song selection and performances are excellent in my opinion it stands up with the best lambert hendricks and ross stuff it is clear that a lot of love and effort went into the making of this record buy and enjoy	9
1	i ca n't discard these songs completely because they have such potential ! clever fun lyrics great beat but boy i wish this guy could hit his notes more often ! i suppose this fellow requires the sort of pitch does n't matter mindset that grateful dead listeners perfected years ago \( or similar drugs \) i'm just not that tolerant or substance affected	9

0	michelle branch carved out a place for herself in the young female pop singer market serveral years ago with a brilliant debut and a successful if derivitive duet with carlos santana this record is her first with friend jessica harp the ladies mine the borderline between the singer songwriter and country genres for quality songs that should fit well in the americana format highlights include the opening track leave the pieces way back home the good kind and the title track stand still look pretty of special note is the presence of producer multi instrumentalist john leventhal on many tracks i recommend this record for folks who like songs that do n't sound like formula country	9

0	forget the nit picky comments you may read here if you are a fan of any of the artists on this album buy it ! the recording is of very high quality and i agree with another review vacuum tube amplification makes the vocals even better the banter between the artists in between the musical numbers is a real treat for fans too young to experience these shows live one other observation if you buy this not having a huge appreciation for sammy already you will be blown away by his talent thanks to sinatra family for releasing this disc hopefully many more are forthcoming	9
0	if you like music you ca n't help but like mariachi from mexico it is superb is there another volume \? if so tell me about it	9
0	this guy is amazing i keep playing this for people and they love it and tell me they have never heard anything like it i even got a huge discount at the auto shop for just having this cd after the mechanic took my car from the parking lot and listened to one minute of this he came in and said that sounds crazy ! you have to let me copy this after getting a nice chunk of cash taken off my bill this cd already paid for itself and never collects dust i know everyone compares clark to aphex twin boards of canada and autechre but for good intentions he is already that good after just a few releases	9
1	there are 2 good songs on this disc stinkfist and aenema the rest are pure crap half of the tracks are n't even songs they 're just a bunch of noise no wonder tool wo n't put any of thier music on itunes or napster they want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your 14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap if you gave this cd 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely	9
0	i never have understood how some people have an inate quality for music and some do n't well willie was one of those that definately did it is hard to imageine the blues without the likes of willie dixon the writer the musician the producer the businessman i listen to his work over and over again each time learning new nuances i did not hear before how incredible is that	9

1	tihs album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day i like all his other albums better i do n't know why he decided to release this crap but the only song i really like is hip hip qurtables	9
1	i have to admit that even though i am a big fan of diesel boy this cd was very boring the beats are too similar on every track and the cd as a whole just has no quot feeling quot to it if you want to hear him at his best by 97 octane	9
1	it has been nearly three months and i have yet to receive the subject michael henderson cd amazon should not be offering this item for sale if they do not have access to a supplier	9
1	after reading glowing reviews of the dbts i picked up three of their cds while some of the lyrics are strong the songs have no melodies whatsoever most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer they 're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of skynyrd and the allmans but those bands were n't just loud guitars they had memorable tunes and great singers dbts are a huge letdown	9
0	this is a great cd quot back where i come from quot is on of those feel good songs that gives me chill bumps every time i here it chesney is a extremely talented artist whose passion is shown in every song i recommend all his albums	9
0	ca n't say enough about how great this record is it still stands the test of time by remaining relevant summerland and mission man are my personal favs but the whole album deserves raves	9
0	if you like post modern lounge music you will like the tracks on this disc	9
1	i thought it would have nice soft songs but it is riddled with annoying sound effects and strange instrumentation	9
0	my 8 month old son and i listen to this cd every night and by the pachelbel canon \( track 7 \) he 's usually sound asleep it is not all synthesizer the jacket clearly states that the music box orchestra includes flute piano cello percussion english horn and oboe as a musician i am not offended by the easy listening versions of these classics in fact i enjoy them they introduce my son to the timeless melodies without overstimulating him at bedtime i find them relaxing too	9
0	not only do you get some great music with this cd you get the beginnings of climax as well \( the last 2 cuts are essentially sonny geraci solo songs done by 1 2 of the band that would play on climax records \) includes their 4 hits \( time wont let me girl in love respectable help me girl \) and a slew of other very like minded material if you like any of their 4 hits you will love the rest if you like climax you should buy this for the 2 last songs which are essentially climax tunes	9
0	i 'll have to accept that even tough i'm not a great fan of this band they have impressed me with this new release the lyrics are in some cases very deep and in songs like evil angel they can touch you right there for me the band has progressed a lot and you can tell that in this album it 's very melodic and more mature also the acoustic version of the diary of jane is amazing i personally recommend the songs breath evil angel and my favorite dance with the devil	9

1	while i love billie in her own words these sessions were dull and uninspired since the reviews should focus on one cd that is the jist of it boring renditions and back up musicians that are not the ones that billie was used to making for a very uneven collection	9
0	i saw her perform most of these songs on austin city limits i must admit i had n't paid much attention to her since her debut album back when i was playing in country bands much of this material is kinda introspective but hey on the plus side you get great vocals well crafted songs tons of sincerity and just flat out integrity from this great artist who does n't have to pretend she is anything she is n't and these days that is pretty refreshing ! i think i am becoming a fan	9
0	yes the beatles by which i'm not comparing supergrass to them no supergrass are riding the road built by not only the beatles but other british rock'n'roll greats like the kinks david bowie the zombies and many others but the exploding energy of supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000 's this will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of british rock'n'roll of the 1990 's and 2000 's and without doubt represent the bohemia intellectual hard rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since circa sgt pepper an intoxicating and highly addictive album 100 recommended for anyone any age	9
0	i feel bad doing this becuase i love iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad all the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating it 's like the first beatles anthology set the material is amazing but the quality is bad on the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise the packaging is also very nice i just though i 'd share this information before you drop all the money on the set if you are a stooges fan do n't hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait	9
1	this whole post crap grunge is crap if you want real rock check out gnr acdc and any band pre grunge i know this is a review but how does this grab ya oh and i wo n't mention the thousands of stupid bands that sing like their trying to go to go to the bathroom quot oh how did we wind up like this \? quot exactly what i'm trying to figure out tesla 's got more talent then all these bands and they ca n't get any airplay give me a break	9
0	the fisrt cd is alot better than this one but this one is still okay i only liked one song on this disc and it is track 4 will the circle be unbroken i 'll fly away jesus loves me do n't get me wrong the music is beautiful but i think the first one is alot better	9
0	if you 're a fan of latin music and especially spanish guitar you will love cafe tropical every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar to piano violin trumpet and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments every time i put this cd on i hear new things which i find makes for an even more enjoyable listen as usual johannes linstead delivers some of the most catchy and memorable melodies in the nouveau flamenco genre and of course his guitar playing speaks for itself highly recommended	9
1	bands from the 90s just sucked and nirvana fits in with that they had a couple of ok songs and kurt cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about i can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were i do n't see it this is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music	9
1	a friend who knows my taste in music recommended vnv nation to me so i got matter form based on the reviews in one sense i like it the production is excellent and i find every track to be creative and unique but i hate the vocals and so i ca n't bear to listen to the cd this dude has the worst voice in music history	9
1	this is a pep rally on cd an unsingable emotionally charged pep rally it really upsets me that this is the face of today 's christian music the melodies are not easily singable at all and the songs use all the same musical cliches this is worship manipulation at it 's best if you read the words to learn something concrete about god you will find nothing of substance they talk about actions to give god and our response to god but no meat and potatoes of why we should be doing this god is great but why \? this is very disturbing and completely unacceptable for congregational worship	9
1	i ordered this cd based on the reviews first i have to say that i am not sure why it is called 'paris under a groove' i was thinking that it would be in french at least the beats are nice i would not in any way compare it to buddha bar i just was n't as thrilled as i thought that i would be it sounded very cheap no originality my fiancee is from paris and this was very disappointing not only to him but i was embarrassed as offering it as a present so far it sits on the shelf	9
0	now i know what you 're thinking why are there two releases of xx \? well after they switched from eclipse to universal records they re released the album xx but they also re recorded all the songs with less hard core vocals \( big mistake ! \) the original album is by far much better than the universal release in december of 2001 if you 're not sure which one to go with go with this one !	9
1	and what 's the point \? all of these songs \( minus a few \) are on the anthology along with countless others the beastie boys did n't put this out their record label did it 's just way for corporate to make money if you consider yourself a real beastie boys fan that is you 're interested in all the other music they made that was n't put on radio then do n't buy this if you occasionally heard them on the radio and fight for your right is your favorite song then go ahead the beastie boys are much more than just their greatest hits to fully appreciate them you have to listen to an album all the way through	9
1	listening to this cd took me back to my growing up years i remembered all their songs i loved back then it 's a great homecoming	9
1	to much guitar drowns out all the other instruments survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums not guitars i was expecting another burning heart is this love high on you no songs on this albums have that sound the vocals by jamison are top notch but none of the songs sound like the survivor i remember survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards bass and drums not drive the whole song i guess jim peterik was the man behind survivor all along i give the cd 2 stars for fire makes steel the rest are throw aways recommended for die hards only i highly recommend 'when seconds count' for anyone getting started with survivor	9
1	tihs album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day i like all his other albums better i do n't know why he decided to release this crap but the only song i really like is hip hip qurtables	9
0	and so worth the price of admission 6 cds worth to be exact coleman 's musical voice is so free and full of life ! it really is beautiful	9
1	some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un inititiated i am writing to confirm that assertion i have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here but what a disappointment this album was for me it sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door my advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down jack 's appreciation of the blues is admirable but only realised on the song i fought piranhas tellingly this is the final song on the album otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times	9

1	like so many new age artists ryan farish has a great ear for melodies unlike most new age artists ryan farish has rhythmic problems he likes to use the delay effect on his piano but either it is not sycronized with the tempo of the song or he is simply being too sloppy with his playing \( sometimes it 's one problem and sometimes it 's both \) i do n't know how he let those takes make it on to the final album also the massively loud reverse cymbal sounds are way overused and make the entire album very abrasive very quickly	9
0	this soundtrack cd is the perfect compliment to the visionary film cater burwells score is a pitch perfect aural equivocation of the profound sadness and blithe absurdity on display with his sense of minimalist suggestiveness and rich textural instincts shining bightly also an added bonus of the above mentioned dream combination bartok 's quot allegro quot \( i know diddly about classical music but bartok rocks ! ! \) and a typically great bjork song quot amphibian quot \( in two versions \) that book ends the album with an etherial dream like haze	9
1	buddy holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th century masters series every one of the cds in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous this one is no exception look elsewhere	9
0	i owned the album as a kid i enjoy it as much now as i did then	9

1	the songs are boring the lyrics are plain i am so dissapointed i bought it without listening to it first thinking i would at least find one song how wrong was i to find out that not even one track speaks to me andrea 's solo album sucked now this ! i think their creative days are over and if i see them in concert again i hope i am not tortured with the music from this new album instead i hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band i love so muc	9

0	this will be short it is worth the price of this album just to hear the branford and harry connick jr duet carolina shout that being said all of the other tracks on this album are excellent from jungle blues to doug wamble 's solo guitar on autumn lamp with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for romare breaden 's art a must have branford keeps outdoing himself	9
0	i love this album but the other review from anonymous is wrong this cd is not remastered i baught this cd because of that review and got burned the cd even says right on it aad in other words analog recording analog master digital playback i will say this much though the transfer is better than mca 's version which i own however if you want a remastered version of the song monster look to the all time greatest hits original recording remasterd cd from mca it also has move over from this cd i love this cd and want it remastered if you gotta have this album \( i do \) than this version sounds better than the mca version	9

1	first of all i only gave this one star because the rating does n't let you go any lower i only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it leaving me to pick it up i proceeded to suffer through it so i could give you fair warning if you buy this consider yourself warned	9
1	there is now no trace of delight left in this band all songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self indulgent i do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever i receive a doe eyed look saying their name but this cd and the cd previous \( which did have 1 tune apples with which one could smile \) does for the first time take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes first we loose the roses then the ned 's disband following that swervedriver breaks apart and velocity girl is gone forevermore now my charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were	9
1	this is probably the worst cd i have ever bought it had won some award and just bought it without listening to it hopping that it would be ok i listened to it and threw the cd in the trashbin waist of money or just not my kind of music	9

0	a great series concept highly significant artists performing material which taken individually or collectively represents a major section of the american music library ofcourse the originally withdrawn w new at the time funky people quot talkin' loud quot by jb \( i bought it retail ! \) is the highlight along with the live quot it 's my thing quot by marva whitney \( yes i saw mw sing it l i v e at madison square garden in july 1969 \) the prev unrel bobby byrd track and vicki anderson 's contribution to the quot cold sweat quot session also reinforce the value for listeners	9

0	to start off i am a huge grateful dead fan and i have prabably about 150 cd 's that cover many years of there carrer this release is very good and worth buying it has some great music on it and the price of the album is worth the eyes of the world with branford marsalis on the sax alone all and all this was among my first bunch of grateful dead cd 's that i got and it got me hooked so do yourself a favor if you are thinking about listening to the grateful dead and you want to hear something from the 1990 era buy this cd but i would also get something from the 77 era too	9

1	i am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this cd we were barely able to make it through one listening this is a classic example of a cd that never would have been produced had the artist \( using the term very loosely \) not already been famous for something besides music the lack of talent and originality on this cd is apalling it only gets a star because that 's the lowest rating i want my money back	9
0	this album has some of the best country songs in the business mark sings songs straight from his heart there are songs for every occasion from the slow ballads like quot too cold at home quot quot i 'll think of something else quot and quot almost goodbye quot to the fast heels kicking quot bubba shot the jukebox quot and quot going through the big 'd' quot these songs are about real life realtionships and how they affect the heart so if you 're in the mood to cry about that lost love or smile now that they 're gone this is the album for you	9

1	is n't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of al jolson \? the problem with so many new traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience hippies and white liberals love it but where does that leave those that are living it \? far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas south of the border and east la 's lysa flores north of the border	9
0	jigga is incredibly hot on this albumbeanie is good to great memphis bleek is really good on this album but is overshadowed his 534 shows how good he is this album does not overall as an album it does a good job of showing off roc a fella but not to much about the dynasty	9

0	another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of lou donaldson the album released on blues notes features lou 's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones lou even opts to 'chill' out on a number called 'over the rainbow' but on other numbers like 'donkey walk' lou 's style and also his unique band really shine the unmistakable hammond adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and swinging drums this brings together another great album keep on funkin mr lou donaldson ! ! ! !	9
1	i opend the cd filled with joy till it started at the beginning i thought there should be some kind of mistake but no there were no letters not even one word we could n't sing at all we just had the letters printed in very tiny letters but no guide to sing	9
1	as a peripheral bnl fan i have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out with previous releases i have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings this cd got stale fast seems to be geared to the tween crowd i am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the bnl i have enjoyed in years past	9
1	after discovering and loving the sound of gotan project i was shopping around for groups with a similar sound i stumbled along emigrante and upon reading the other reviews written on this site about this cd i thought i had found another gem boy was i wrong the first track drew me in and left me spellbound unfortunately it was all downhill after that i was listening to the cd for the first time in my car and forgot it was even on the rest of the songs were so uninspiring the music soon became nothing more than meaningless background noise	9

0	i do n't like this album as much as their earlier stuff i have liked each release less than the previous and this one falls right in line with that trend the opener quot quality revenge quot is one of their best songs hands down though this is a very good cd but the farther from braid we get in time the less i seem to like their music	9
1	as much as i have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled chemistry between buckshot and 9th wonder the beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone they are working on a part two so i hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was	9
0	even if you do n't know much about donny hathaway this collection of songs is a fun mix and it 's very moving it includes some classics with roberta flack that are terrific i enjoy it tremendously	9
1	i'm a huge fan of christopher lawrence 's stuff but i aboslutely refuse to buy this cd because of the copy protection i do not pirate music and should be allowed to copy music i purchase onto my mp3 player of choice this is just sad	9
0	i love that garage days re re visited is on the flip side in the cassette i had warped a long time ago ! i like this one	9
0	this has to be one of the most beautiful cds ever recorded damien 's vocal range is vast his musicianship excellent but it 's the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists haunting sensitive flowing crashing \( if i have one criticism it 's the mixing levels at times his vocals are drowned in concert when he lets rip you really feel the power of his vocals music which unfortunately does n't come over quite as well on the album \) a truly magical album	9
0	what an awesome cd i bought a flogging molly cd as well but dropkick murphy 's are better by far !	9
1	for fans i suppose this would be a rather big delight for non fans it 's nothing that will turn you on to the band from jersey they had some okay cheesy hits in the '80s but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays	9
0	i 've always liked tevin campbell he had a beautiful voice and really did it on break it down i particularly like break it down shhh brown eyed girl among others excellent cd overall	9
1	shannon lawson is capable of a much better album i saw him down in nashville when he was with the galoots and it was amazing ! if they were to put out a cd i'm sure it would be one of my favorites shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that 's what nashville should have let him do on his first solo cd instead they gave it this generic overproduced sound leaving shannon sound like everyone else with the way bluegrass is selling these days it 's a shame that shannon could n't showcase his enormous talent in the proper arena	9
0	this album came out about 8 years before i was born all the years i still remember turning on the classic radio stations that would play wbss or billie jean now i know all the lyrics and music videos from this album this is mj in his prime unfortunately we will never get another epic like this again michael is sadly a target in the media but he is still a great music icon whether you like him or not every song off here is a classic one song i thought was unneccesary was baby be mine but otherwise it 's excellent if you starting an mj collection get this album first trust me	9
1	metallica never recovered from the death of cliff burton as this album is prime evidence of he helped to bring depth to the songs that is not present here also newstead only gets one song on this album which is ironically the best song on the album in the history of metallica this album marks the transition from artistic song writing to commercial	9
1	being a huge blondie fan i want to rate this one higher but sadly i cannot it 's just a sad mishmash of bad songs it feel very negligant too i love the way blondie contributed to rap and disco but their calypso number on this one is so awful they had lost it here check out thier truly great albums instead like paralel lines or eat to the beat	9
0	i was a music director at a college radio station when this came out and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention shoegazers \? \? \? i am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger just buy it and all the rest	9
1	i 've owned this cd but did n't keep it for very long because it 's too poppy and slick for my tastes i guess when about 1981 came around billy just wanted to distance himself from the brilliance of his 70 's style and on this offering he kind of wanted a 50 's or 60 's kind of sound this stuff is just to slick for this hombre he never made a solid album after the release of glass houses in about 1980 this is the kind of stuff that yuppies rave about but if you 've got some integrity you 'll probably want to steer clear of this one and buy anything he recorded in the 70 's	9
0	a friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago i listened to a few minutes of it and was like what is this crap \? and i shelved it for a couple months i then picked it back up and gave it another listen to my surprise it was really catchy to me the music \( and lyrics \) are simple but thats what i like about them theyre simple ! this is a great college rock cd i plan on checking out more teenage fanclub and i suggest you do the same notable tracks are sidewinder what you do to me and is this music \?	9
1	someone suggested i listen to this because i was at the time into what lame beret wearing record store dips would call creatively aggresive music then it was death metal \( which i prefer without cursing or filth you understand \) since then i 've found the ascension into gabber and then full on unmitigated hardcore anyway mr bungle tepid uninteresting bland stupid gives the chin strokers something to fascinate over let them someone 's got the fuel the economy	9
1	the cat carol is the most depressing christmas song i have ever heard not to ruin the ending for you but the cat dies ! did n't exactly put me in the holiday spirit	9
1	i think ms hewitt misses the mark yes for an actress turned singer she 's ok and its more her acting clout that has landed her this record deal and not her talent as a singer would someone off the street with the same looks and musical level get a record deal \? i think not same goes for the other latin jennifer	9
0	if you are a fan of the winter 's solstice series than you will enjoy this cd especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music	9
0	this cd was well worth the wait ! it contains music and artists that were previously unavailable and not even heard on the radio in years i took one of the cds out of the box put it in the player and within minutes my wife and i were dancing the sound quality in my judgment is solid the packaging is fun and creative and the booklet containing the cameo parkway story was an interesting read there will always be arguments about stuff that was included and not included but this is an excellent overview of a wonderful era what great fun to hear the orlons chubby checker the tymes the dovells bobby rydell and dee dee sharp once again	9
0	i like every song but 1 on this cd they 're the same ones that 're on the movie and if you do n't like the movie you probably would n't like the cd	9
0	this cd is a must for anyone who enjoys great guitar music its packed full of amazing pieces and inspiring playing my favorite track is is n't it romantic because it successfully makes a classic out of this song buy it now ! !	9
1	this is not the music from the movie this purchase was a major dissapointment you would do beter searching for the music credits for titles then download the tracks form your music subscriber	9
1	this was for a friend and i have no feedbac	9
1	de la proliferacion de bandas angloparlantes de los '70 no encuentro motivos para destacar esta placa una mas y nada mas ue eso despues de todo es mi humilde opinion humm humble pie descansa tranquilo	9
1	jessica is blessed with a powerful and beautiful voice but you wo n't get the chance to hear it on this cd this cd is a complete let down it is her worst one yet ! do n't get me wrong i love jessica but seeing her waste her god given gift on a bunch of kitty cat songs is just so tragic	9
0	like i said i would i finally got around to purchasing this cd i especially like tracks 9 12 cheap trick is solid as always i have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases if i do have any criticism at all it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled trick riffs i guess it 's hard to create new stuff after 30 years anyway there are some great tunes on this buy it like i did !	9
1	id advise not to buy the album listening to it is like contacting gonorrhea trust me ive done both	9
1	sorry to say i'm not a huge fan of tanghetto even after seening them play live at la viruta last month few of the tracks are just undanceable and the music gets pretty boring after a while i say if you want neuvo tango try narcotango or otro aires	9
0	together with 'the best of kool amp the gang' t h i s is the ultimate bit of funk that i 've found so far the tracks may not always have a quot song structure quot \( and for me the women singers may be omitted \) the funkiest bits in history are found here ! ! ! ! ! !	9
1	blatant sentimentality without any touch of irony or wit elefant 's lyrics i personally like interpol and the strokes i resent that they are being compared to these cheeseballs	9
0	like louis jordan his less well known contemporary jump jive artist cab calloway fits into an area much beloved by americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre rock and roll music though in truth i do love jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of r amp b calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive jump music ca n't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart	9
1	i purchased empty not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable but eventually forgettable pop rock this sophomore effort is simply put amatuer and sub par some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as empty b sides while the cover of electric avenue never really distracts most listeners from thinking what is this and why \? over all this might appeal to most christian radio listeners but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is mold fitting white noise	9
0	ministry of sound has always had the reputation of putting out the best music they have a way of findind the best dj 's artists producers and remixers from the 4 corners of the earth and bringing them to us on a cd this cd is no exception soothing beats without lacking in tempo or energy this cd could literally be enjoyed by a cowbow from kentucky it 's just that palattable	9
0	i usually do n't do album reviews but i gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and i was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine i call quot the sauce quot so many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings word of mouth is bliss a g 2 a ke who came out on rap a lot has n't come out with a cd since this classic i'm salty they did n't quot make it quot because this was heavily slept on	9
0	his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics he has an eclectic mix of love songs we are the world type songs and a few others on this album he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes i loved streetcorner symphony ! it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one ! enjoy this album i sure do	9
1	after reading so many positive reviews i was very exited when i recieved this cd in the mail i popped it in my bose wave radio turned it up to 85 and listened to the most annoying hissing sound i 've ever heard coming from my system i regret purchasing this cd	9
0	i like this album its got a nice mix of old and new material along with some live material great to see pe still at it in this ever changing rap game	9
1	great cd imus in the morning recommended highly and the i man was not wrong one of the best cd 's i 've owned in years i listen to a lot of buffett james taylor delbert mcclinton and this cd places high in these ranks	9
0	this is the first of alison 's album 's that i bought many years ago i 've watched her career blossom she was an unknown when she recorded this album but in my opinon it 's her best ! true bluegrass beautiful voice wonderful music ! i 've had the opportunity to see her and the band in concert several times and their music never leaves me disappointed	9
1	i played several samples of this cd on my computer while visiting the amazon website and my male cat started meowing along this cd is good for calming a cat and lining his box face it yoko ca n't sing \( unless you have a cat 's ears \)	9
1	know here is man with absoultely no lyrical skillsbaby dont get with a wanksta good girl wants a gangstawhat about girls just want normal people no way can anybody like slim thugeverybody likes a pimp onli weird and freakish people doslim thug isnt a thug if he was he would be in jail studo gangsta gangst	9
0	this is an amazing beautiful album probably a little more difficult to get into than streethawk but after about the 4th or 5th listen i found it more rewarding the music is very dense and the lyrics are beautifully poetic \( it helps that dan bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time \) a great album for any fan of intelligent independent music	9
1	this is as bad as the film in fact just like the film the soundtrack is the same old formula will amp his movies amp music never change the same old beat the rest of the soundtrack is just as bad unoriginal amp boring what a waste of kool moe dee	9
1	i love running to the marine corps cadence cds volumes 1 and 2 are very good volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral when running vols 1 2 are better synched for continuous running the transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me others do n't seem to agree and i still run to this cd i 'd buy 1 and 2 first if you do n't have them	9
1	i received emails about delaying my order three times since it showed that the product was available i did n't understand why i had to wait less than two months to get my order i was so disappointed by the amazon this time ! doing business like that i am not sure how long you will survive	9
1	this is no saw 85 92 as some people compare it to oh no this is a largely unfulfilling listen the tracks all sound too similar i realize richard 's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear but the drum programming and harmonic development is lackluster only track worth burping over is the last one xmd something has he been taking piano lessons since druqks \? for those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch check out nick forte 's new release young man 's disease which is better than anything else i 've heard this year	9
0	well here we are one of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90 's lifeforms is true sonic adventure this is obviously some of the best work that fsol ever did lifeforms is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together interchanged and meshed for ambient work it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace there is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs despite their being ambient it is very original i praise originality in music give it a try put on some flower bird wings or some elaborate burn	9
1	i had the privilege of attending recitals of many of the 50 's and 60 's jazz legends before they became household names it was truly an honor and a blessing to be part of an era that will never come around again i heard brief notes from this cd and i must agree that mr winston did attempt to capturemr guaraldi 's timeless expressions but the this production did not have the same golden flow as the original	9
0	this cd has all of the cuts that you remember from back in the day you will love it it is always in my car	9
1	gonzalo is a fantastic pianist this cd however is meant to capture his more thoughtful and sensitive side however it is languid and the tunes do n't stand out it is hard to tell if track 2 is really track 4 as the plodding bass and minimalist approach on piano make for sleepy moments if driving later in the day i have heard him with fire and brimstone and sometimes it goes over the edge of taste but it is exciting not here there is barely a hint of any cuban influence in this music as well now some will like the gentleness i suppose but with weak material and not much diversity it sits pretty flat with me	9
0	these 3 discs \( there is a limited edition 10 disc set which has obviously sold out ! ! \) are a continuation of live dead if you have n't heard the dead live then start with this or live dead you will realise why to many they were america 's greatest improvisational rock band the playing the interplay between the musicians particularly garcia and lesh is staggering and how about a big hand for bill kreutzman on drums	9
0	there are some amazing moments on this record i find myself freaking out to three songs in a row and waiting for the fourth song to end the de la collaboration is weak it 's got the great wild style instrumental but the chorus is obnoxious some of the more r b toned tracks fall flat in my opinion	9
0	this was not a waste of brad 's time or mine good job !	9
1	i'm a big fan of great big sea and i purchase everything they release apparently they were trying to give this cd the feel of a live medium size venue performance unlike their other live dc offerings this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro cassette tape in some fan 's front pocket it does n't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound overall i was pretty disappointed and i 'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one	9
0	i must agree with the comments made by other reviewers this album is great nancy wilson 's voice on this album is unlike anything i have ever heard you ca n't honestly say you 're a fan of jazz if you do n't own this	9
0	saw this fella in 'you see me laughin' on ifc good straight ahead delta style blues this is the real deal	9
1	i agree with other reviewers do n't waste your money i should have listened to the samples to hear more awful fakes visit the producer 's web site at drewsfamous com listen to their selection of garbage before you make the purchase	9
1	\( with the possible exception of klemperer 's fidelio \) i am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message as mr clinton 's campaign team would say it 's the singing stupid do not be mislead by the starry names this thing barks and yowls like new year 's eve in the cats and dogs home do not pass go do not waste 35 go directly to josef krips on decca legends for three discs of perfect joy	9
1	too lisa loeb for me sorry maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics	9
1	i just sold this back through amazon i was so disapointed with it it 's an all cover record and while greg duhli does add an interesting twist to the covers all of the music feels too subdued too flat duhli is lacking the usual passion he brought to the whigs and the first twilight singers recording	9
0	if you want some classical music to sleep to do n't buy this cd if you want some high energy symphonies however i highly recommend it from bach to vivaldi the pure energy of this cd will give you a new understanding of the joys of classical music just do n't listen to track 25 because i have no idea why john philip sousa is included with tchaichovsky	9
0	anyone who had access to a radio in the 80 's would know at least two songs by missing persons their fun music and amazing flare \( dale did have pink and white stiped hair and it looked great ! \) make this a good party album i also have their album color in your life and most of the songs are great just as an added note warren cuccarullo is now a member of duran duran \( my personal favorite band \) and has been since he appeared on their notorious album which was released in 1986 ! !	9
0	the music intelligentia probably wo n't like james morrison 's new album because almost everybody else will love it bourgeois uncool however if you just listen and feel this album even if you have snobbish tendencies it will move you enjoy this amazing new album i am	9
1	after chancing upon galactic 's rather remarkable live show at a local bar i jumped through numerous hoops to track down this disc was n't worth the effort i'm afraid velveeta on wonder bread dull collection of acid jazz duds not bad as background noise for your next dinner party but captures exactly none of the blood and soul that make galactic such a great live act a pass for all but galactic completeists if such an animal exists	9
0	as a collector of musical scores i thoroughly enjoyed this selection it is rated as one of my favorites but i must warn that if you do not like instramental style music then this is n't for you but if you are then this is a must	9
1	buyer beware these new journey releases are reissues of their 1996 remastered releases they are not remastered in 2006 rhino should be ashamed of itself for this \( it 's been 10 years i would have gladly paid for a remastered version but not for new packaging \)	9
0	i really enjoyed the song kids in america by no secrets both of my children enjoyed it as well in fact i have been looking for their cd or for more information on them i thought they were cute fresh and brought a new touch to the song	9
1	these are the same tracks from totally buble which was released without buble 's consent totally buble is not an album that i wanted to be released they were songs i recorded for a film called totally blonde many years ago before i was signed to 143 reprise records the decision to release it as an album was made by the film 's producer and i had no control over stopping him it is important for everyone to know that i only want to release quality music to my fans by offering my best work and i sincerely apologize if you purchased this album michael buble	9
0	and he know 's nothing about popular music and really should get back to work and stop sitting around convincing himself that he does dumbass	9
1	a mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s do n't even bother	9
1	this man is like michael bay using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing the fact that chris tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it 's patheic and not funny and that is also why the man who is now making x men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies the man is a joke	11
0	i was never a richard burton fan until i discovered this movie richard burton 's acting in this movie is top notch burton is able to pull you into his character of british agent alec leamas and make it all believable thankfully the movie is in black and white because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film the dvd transfer and digital 5 1 sound are excellent it 's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect 's could be so entertaining but it is the question is will alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him	11
1	jet li as a contrac killer \? come on ! the reason why this movie is n't that famous is because it pretty much sucks it 's just a shootem up bang bang type of movie no realy kung fu here	11
0	well written well acted and well directed this is much better than 99 of all films on tv or in the theatres the only reason it is unknown is its adult content marijuana smoking and romantic affairs lending amusing background to a woman 's haphazard but fortunate search for control of her life this is that rare bird an intelligent film for adults my favorite line joe mantegna 's remark to mia farrow you 're really interesting after she relates a private comment she heard him make while she was invisible it is not a 5 star film like say witness but it is an excellent small film this is for film fans who prefer romance to violence	11
0	i got what i ordered in a timely fashion with no complaints thank you	11
1	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
1	it 's not just that if lucy fell is a bad film 90 of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer director star eric schaeffer 's nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday 's roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he 's cute speaks volumes	11
1	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
0	it is an fantastic concept for a movie plot just how much trouble can a frozen man from the past get in \? this man is even less refined than tarzan but has a better sense of humour if your feeling down and want a pick me up this is a must see	11
0	seriously one of my favorite movies of all time thank goodness for 1980 's rewinds kate hudson 's character is ridiculous in the absolute best sense of the word oh and martha plimpton never ages she 's a freak of nature now get off the computer and let 's go party risa garcia style f yeah	11
0	far more complex and feministic than the girls and flapper fashions would have you believe needs to be seen in it 's entirity and revived for a modern audience as the series is now an overlooked gem the leads are excellent and follow in the best traditions of such british historical series such as upstairs downstairs if you have never seen it you will not be dissapointed and the lead actresses are extremely good both rada trained and both have worked extensively with the royal shakespeare company	11
1	i live in the uk and amazon does n't allow me to download any off the ncis shows this service should be open to all amazon users ! ! ! ! ! !	11
0	nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor 's office confucius overcame many difficulties	11
1	a slow loggy movie about a philandering husband \( everyone was guessing this was watergate reporter carl bernstein in the nora ephron novel on which the movie is based he was ephron 's husband \) jack nicholson plays the husband and meryl streep the wife and both are uncharacteristically bland there is hardly anything to the story they marry she gets pregnant he gets restless and wanders we finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started very dull	11
1	this movie is not very well written in my opinion and is probably a good thing that it is priced so high most of it is uninportant dailog that seems to have little or no piont with no story or structure there is alittle action at the end but of poor qualaty to make a long review short it is basically like a bad episode of g i jeo	11
1	lorna is pretty and her suitor is devoted the story holds your attention for many that is enough some auspicious beginnings without depth so maybe 3 stars for some people i give 2 stars if i do not keep it to watch again in later years i found the romance unfulfilling and so the movie romance movies that i liked better are north south pride prejudice 1940 1996 2006 wives and daughters and a walk to remember adventure with romance the scarlet pimpernel	11
1	this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb \? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd \? what sense does this make \? what a disappointment this service is	11
1	i was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average bad guys on the run movie gee billy bob thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he does n't like cops at all he even uses bad language ! a friend was watching it with me and he thought i was watching the lifetime channel this movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard	11
1	even though i am not a sophia loren fan i thoroughly enjoyed her perfomance in these 3 different short stories about 3 totally different women anyone born before 1940 should enjoy them as well	11
1	i read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the mom in the book fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late so i feared that this movie would not be up to the book my fears were unfounded the casting was brilliant and i loved this movie even though it is tough to watch i still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and must watch that is how good it is	11
0	100 men and a girl is rank sentimentality with a great sound track it deserves to be on dvd for the sound track alone durbin 's rendition of the mozart alleluia sends chllls down the spine	11
1	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11
1	admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it 's moments of entertainment but overall it 's long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this did n't do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman 's silent scientific discoveries completely amusing could n't wait for the movie to end honestly	11
1	i did n't even open this copy of gothic as soon as i realized it was n't letterboxed i immediately returned it i 've seen the movie before i love ken russell but i wont' watch it if is n't in letterbox	11
0	this is definitely not the typical look at the death camps this is a truely horrific look into the reality that was the death camps i wish it was longer but the limited time reveals so much more than we ever get from all the other narrative tours with the option of just listening to the soundtrack that adds a different dimension that ca n't be duplicated	11
1	just repeat the following several times 1 \) draggy plot2 \) uninspired acting especially allen who almost sinks it3 \) unimaginative \( story direction etc \) then get a hitchcock film	11
1	blech ! i really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute wrong ! it was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were the only redeeming actor was justin long the rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells	11
0	this has always been one of my alltime cinema favorites and i was happy to see it available on dvd the story the script the direction and the acting are superb	11
1	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it did n't play anyway i gave up	11
0	bones is one of my favorite tv series this one episode i missed so i had to get it to keep on track great show even if you have never seen it from the begining	11
1	something fishy is certainly going on if the average review for this movie is 4 stars this is truely the worst adaptation of a novel ever made costner should be tried for crimes against cinematography this movie is far beyond awful	11
1	i love sophia loren as an actress however this dvd as 3 movies in one package is a very very very poor quality dvd colors are bad picture is bad and the sound is even worse do n't waste your money my dvd copy was bought from amazon this is my advic	11
1	as segal continutes to move toward orson welles dimensions his movies get progresivly worse let 's hope this is his last	11
1	this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence	11
0	csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i 've only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great	11
1	as along time fan of paddy chayefsky i found altered states his first novel terribly disappointing the film was in my view utterly dismal the only reason i would recommend it would be as an example of hack movie making if it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either chayefsky or russell both would be relegated to obscurity	11
0	as others have noted arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball my man godfrey genre it is an effectively told outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies however without sir john gielgud \( a gentleman who truly deserved the knighthood \) the film 's faults would be much more apparent he elevates every scene he is in with his impeccable refinement and a wit that is sharpened to perfection he is the pillar in a film which desperately needed credibility and the title song is a classic	11
0	it 's a great human being mr elvis aaron presley and his talent is real in this funny movi	11
1	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	11
0	i wo n't lie this movie sucks however it is so cheesy and lame that it will make you wet your pants i do n't care what people say but i like the no name actors and the wanna be power ranger ninjas it is a great movie because it is the worst movie ever also i must add that the action was utterly stupid and the acting was absolutely pathetic \) great movie though yes i will agree the plot sucks however there is no plot therefor the movie rocks buy it now and own the best movie ever for two bucks used and new it 's the corniest and cheesiest movie ever !	11
1	so i saw this one live action alice in wonderland movie and it sucked ! ! ! ! but i'm confused this is n't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie i think it is i'm not sure if i want to risk boring myself with other crap so will i watch this verison ever who knows	11
1	i wish that amazon can get it right that when you create a service you do not have to go into some 's computer and screw around shame on you amazon for allowing this to happen i guess i will have to purchase an apple ipod and go with i tunes it appears to be a much better product and service	11
1	jane fonda was not only an excellent actress but a beautiful if opinonated \( remember hanoi jane \? \) woman i watched this as a teenager and despite the striptease this has to be one of her worst hormones be damned watching this was a waste of time if you like fonda try klute she was an excellent actress but no one could survive this mess	11

0	this movie shows the real life hell that was andersonville a prison camp that turned into a death camp not enough food water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there the south was losing the war so they had no provisions or men to assist in the detainment of these captured soldiers basically letting them rot slowly inside the walls that confinded them a well acted movie which shows the hell that can come from wa	11

1	how on earth casper van diem accept to shoot this film i will never know it 's a joke unfortunately not a good joke special effects \? forget it good acting \? the actors seem to never have heard about it a plot \? nosense what is this can somebody tell me \? the so called quot sharks quot do n't scare even a three year old child !	11
1	albert pyun is my absolute least favorite director i hate his guts his direction ruined quot cyborg quot and was murky in quot omega doom quot this is his best flick and it 's not that good in fact it pales in comparison to the so so original sasha mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable but highly forgettable the villain from the first tong po has returned after killing the sloan brothers from the first movie now he 's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother david sloan standard martial arts fare some choppy fight scenes but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck	11
0	an old movie but a good movie the end is a sad comment on the society of tomorrow heston and robertson do a great job of acting the pace is a little slower than current special effects of today 's movies if you are not a fast paced dude and can slow down then i would recommend this one for you	11
1	it gets two stars for the unintentional comedy other than that it 's one of the worst of the ultra cheesy predictable low budget horror movies from the early nineties the fx are funny at first but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy the acting is uniformly terrible and one has to image that the typically enjoyable barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her	11
1	do n't waste your time or money with this dvd the best part of the dvd is probably the trailers and most of those are garbage also my dvd came loose in the package and scratched too bad it did n't do any damage to ruin the movie i could n't wait until the movie was over i would have stopped it earlier but wanted to see if any damage was done you 'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier the last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off do n't waste your money spend it on the cheap 5 6 horror dvd 's because at least those can be somewhat entertaining	11
0	i 've been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd to ad to my collection again if you like bill murray you 'll like this movie also randy quaid is hilarious murphys law at it 's best ! cracks me up just thinking about it	11

0	this wonderful little book is for you the student of screenwriting how do i know \? i had the good fortune of being in dr claudia hunter johnson 's screenwriting class at florida state university we used the methods described in her book and they work ! if you are disciplined enough to follow her process you will amaze yourself you will begin with le menu \( your very own personal autobiography \) and finish with a well crafted script although you will not have her direct feedback you will have the benefit of a script coach who has helped launch a thousand careers tom	11
1	sure the animation is interesting for a few minutes \( if you are interested in rotoscoping see waking life \) but the story and writing are horrible and bordem sets in within ten minutes you will hang in for a bit waiting for somthing to happen but it wo n't so do n't bother with this movie it 's painful to sit through \( and i love rotoscoping \)	11
1	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
1	purely for fans of crappy van damme movies again like i says really corny from beginning to end paul sorvino is totally and utterly fat and moronic in this one rob schnider is wasted and why the hell was he in this i will have no clue van damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in double team with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said hey ! ! ! ! damnit lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here	11
0	first of all i am a huge beatles nut so any movie made by them or about them i love with that out of the way i can say that this was a very good movie for those expecting a movie like a hard days night it is nothing like that this movie is about john lennon 's friend who was the bass player for the beatles at the begginging of their carrear it shows how he lost his interst for music and fell in love wiht a german lady i wont tell u the ending but this is a true story all in all i thought this was a great movie you should defiently buy it	11
1	oh please whoever has the rights to dub off the original 1972 masterpiece theater tv series of 'cousin bette' do so and make it available on dvd this was one of the finest shows ever created for television truly it totally eclipses the 1998 movie version and now 40 years later i fear it will soon not be physically possible to render this production to dvd for the sake of one of the theater \( and humanity 's \) most glorious theatrical efforts please make the original tv version available ! \( btw i rate the original item at 5 stars !	11
0	even though gordon lui is the main reason you 're buying this film the story is n't bad either excellent training sequences and even better fighting sequences my only complaint was a dragged out jail scene which lasts about 15 minutes but that scene is not enough to tarnish this film this is a solid film	11
0	this was a hilarious movie even though i have never seen it before it had alot of funny scenes but as david rigsbey says it had no direction	11
0	let me be honest here i'm not a big fan of either nicole kidman or tom cruise however this movie is wonderful great story great characters the only reason i did n't give this movie five stars is the ending i think it could have been better great movie overall	11

1	i recall this movie fondly unfortunately the dvd quality is so poor this cannot be watched pity amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings do n't waste your time until someone cleans this up but it makes a nice coaster though	11
0	the classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film the film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness welles is excellent as edward rochester the tormented master of the house joan fountaine is wonderful as jane look for a very young elizabeth taylor in one of her earliest roles this material has been done many times but watch this version	11
0	i have loved this movie since i was a kid it is lightyears better than the hornblower series that was on a e i have read forester 's hornblower series at least 10 times and never get tired of returning to them gregory peck is not quite the hornblower that i have come to know over the years but he does a great job thank goodness this movie is out in dvd my vhs version is on its last legs	11

0	this is an ideal movie for home theatre i grew up on a working ranch and richard farnsworth james caan and jane fonda are totally convincing as cowboys and cowgirl jason robards is utterly evil in this movie i 've liked them all in several other movies but none are as good as this one the breathtaking backdrop and a really well written story combined with an excellent array of talent makes this one of the treasures of my western collection	11

1	this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology is n't there yet	11
0	all 3 wiwag are excellent this is more than just a well put together documentary its very moving because of the footage narration and music you do n't feel like you are watching a dvd about baseball it feels like you are watching a snapshot of americana from the 50 's and 60 's after watching this you wish that things today were as they were back in those days not just baseball or sports but life in general as it was protrayed in the dvds	11
0	this amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it they should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and i do n't see how to download it again update most of the problems i experienced were with my sattelite connection after 175 mb they start to throttle the speed way down i upgraded and this helped i can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours if you are having trouble read your sattelite fair access policy	11
1	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
0	nice actor clark gable and doris day is very charming actress story is comedy touch and romantic picture is monocromatic but i feel flesh now this dvd is really excellent and i love it	11
1	i was very disappointed the acting by the principles was fine but i think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by bob fosse i think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs the following tunes from the original show were left out near to you we 've got to think about the game a man does n't know and applegate 's tune the good old days was abridged a new tune there 's something about an empty chair was added to replace near to you but it was very weak i wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they 've done recently with music man and bye bye birdie	11
1	i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed incorrectly as there is no shania performance on the dvd as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal sorry ! !	11

0	the environment of this movie was so unusual for me since i know virtually nothing of the maiori culture i was enthralled with this movie	11
1	the unbox video version of this film for tivo is useless only after purchasing it did i discover that this film can only be downloaded to a tivo a certain number of times in a certain time period for more than the cost of the dvd i'm restricted in when where and how i can watch this movie nothing like being treated like a criminal by the movie studios i will not purchase another tivo unbox film	11
0	the title of this movie holds no secrets the virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic between the acting and a great story line but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions	11
1	with as many big names in this i thought it would be amazing well it is a corn ball adventure its set in ancient times yet one man beats someone up flies off whips out a pair of modern day sunglasses and puts them on and poses ! ! \( shakes head \) its things like this that really hurt the film for many kung fu hong kong film fans i really wanted to like this film but could n't get past the ridiculousness of it now corny can be ok at times but this is just rubbish	11
0	having watched this dvd only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting the tour de force of sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed the highlight for me was carol burnett and the hilarious performance of everyone needs a maid only carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour i do recommend this dvd and i look forward to veiwing the disc again on a cold wet night with a bottle of wine and a good fire going in the wood burner	11
1	this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb \? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd \? what sense does this make \? what a disappointment this service is	11
1	this movie started out good but then got all mushy with the action and the gunfire good snowboarding stunts and the cast is great sawa looks a little scruffy looking like i said with the snowboarding and action dont mix well and it gets muddled when the badguys come alon	11
0	this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today 's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom 's thing	11
0	i think this was a great spin off from stargate sg 1 which was starting to get stale even though i love watching it still love being able to download them all just wish they 'd get updated quicker ! honestly when i left 2 weeks ago i saw the last episode available and i 've missed the next 2	11
0	while this movie was filmed in the coos bay oregon area i got to be an extra in it i had my doubts about it at the time but now that i have seen it i say it is well worth watching if you like humor and a feel good movie some profanity and mild nudity not for the real youngins btw i am the guy in the blue baseball cap at the bar the girl i was flirting with is my sister	11
0	i very much enjoyed this story of a man battling drug addiction alcoholism michael keaton has never been better and his portrayal is dead on even when the film is occasionally hard going at times in fact the whole cast is first rate the direction good and the script unflinching and realistic of all the films about drug addiction this one is highly recommended and the ending is even happy	11
0	ok i like horror movies and i like slashers movies and even if this is a low buget slasher it works very well the cast is unknowens so it gives you the feeling that any of them could die at anytime and that helps plus the guy in the mine suit with the pix ax is very scarey give it a try	11
0	were scenes added to the dvd if yes what scenes \? for example did dave ever talk to katarina after she slapped him in the original release	11
0	saturday night and sunday morning is very good social realist film finney is fantastic as rebellious youth arthur seaton having a sexual relationship with a married woman while also having a girlfriend portrays the sexual liberation of that time sex before marriage was becoming more and more common and this film represents this change in british society it was a well made film for the time and even today has an appealing quality	11
0	i must say that i am generally not interested in watching a romance movie but this movie is a definite exception it possessed a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly captivating scenery that is incredible and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story from beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie it piques the curiosity it warms the heart and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it buy it you wo n't regret it	11
0	this jet li movie is thus far the best movie since shaolin temple as younger jet li its awesome surreal fighting creates this epic feel to the whole genre of martial arts fighting jet li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie it has laughter suspense compassion and innocense the most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the witches pawn this film is highly recommended to those who love jet li and crouching tiger hidden dragon an excellent movie to add to the jet li collection	11
1	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
1	this movie i think was just plain depressing ! just when you think something good and happy will happen someone dies people seperate bones are broken so on and so forth this movie got alot of great reviews and it was a fun movie but for people who like complete happy endings this film is not for you	11
1	i love the avatar and i was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is i 've been trying for the past days and darn it all it 's not working ! ! ! it 's not as if i'm downloading it for free i am willing to pay and yet it just would n't go through ! ! ! i think it 's better to just buy the dvds i think it 's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that	11
0	after i saw this film i went in my backyard and tried digging then my mom yelled at me now i'm older and i am going to order this dvd the movie is awesome it 's a classic in my mind	11

0	although given short shrift by the few critics who watched it this is a worthy effort marked by good acting direction technicals and an intelligent script although in a state of undress through much of the film kelly lynch is given an opportunity to display the full panoply of her acting range as there are essentially only two actors and as so often with independent films all involved have an opportunity to be truly creative the desert setting enhanced the starkness of the extreme emotions to which the viewer is exposed	11
0	this movie will make you laugh and cry with a who 's who of hollywood the music alone will move you to the kleenex box if you have lost someone to aids this movie will touch you deeply i was told not to watch this movie alone watch it with someone to hug how right they were bronson pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have eric roberts and gregory harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples i know bravo ! get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect	11
1	jeremy brett was by this time indeed quot the dying detective quot but his real life condition in no way helps this tedious and undramatic rendition of one of conan doyle 's more tasteless holmes stories the original features some of holmes' worst and most insensitive treatment of poor watson but since this series made such a thing of their friendship the adapters have a heck of a time getting around it stick with the brett episodes from the mid 80s when he was fresh in the role and the adaptations were true and intelligent	11
0	we 've seen several versions of cinderella now and like this one the best when my kids were smaller they liked the disney version with the little mice but now they have thrown the disney version out the window i personally really liked the julie andrews b w version due to the great singing but my girls prefer and love watching this version while singing and dancing around the room as the dvd plays	11

1	i was not thrilled with this work here 's why the movie jumps about in non logical fashion that distracts from the flow it is beautifully filmed with great costumes colors imagery but the acting is so bland almost weak ! christ i wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate ! the sex scenes were boring maybe i should make films ! this is frustrating ! ! it had it 's moments so 2 stars wish someone would make a movie about 'narcissus and goldmund' or 'cloister and the hearth' now that would be passionate ! \( unless amblin or touchstone did it \)	11

1	it 's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to hollywood for a new version of fahrenehit 451 although i appreciate what truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties the movie just does not hold up well in 2007 particularly when shown in a high school classroom advancements in cgi could transform bradbury 's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller my students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically that being said the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie did n't satisfy their understanding lose the wires on the jet packs !	11
1	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show	11
1	cyrano is one of the greatest verse plays ever written unfortunately gerard depardieu is no cyrano he 's a great clumsy side of beef not a shining flame encased in the middleweight body of hercule sevanien cyrano de bergerac with the best will in the world his performance seldom achieves adequacy and never brilliance the english translation was especially commissioned for this film it is undistinguished prosy and dull it has little of the wit and less of the poetry of the old standard translation commissioned in the 1920s by the great american actor walter passmore get the jose ferrer version this one 's a dog	11
0	i read a negative review of this show but i just watched it and it was better than foretold i expect it will do better than people think it 's basically a danielle steele novel come to life courtney cox is a somewhat stern and enigmatic publisher of a los angeles gossip magazine the other characters are troubled celebrities \( who have sex a lot \) the show feels very contemporary it is definitely a drama despite moments of levity it is basically a dramatic story in any case my bet is that this show will get better and that naysayers are jumping the gun	11

0	there is a good reason you 'd want to buy this from amazon the quality sure you can watch it for free on cbs but the quality is n't very good it 's streamed and the bitrate \( quality \) is low personally i want to watch survivor on my 50 plasma not on my computer screen so i use unbox windows media center to make that happen survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider	11

1	i thought thet this movie was the worst movie ever based on the talent that was involved i do n't think that yuen wah could have been any worse jet li was pretty good but how the hell do you screw that up tsui hark seemingly did n't rush through this movie but it still turns out horribley i would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad but i 'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse	11

1	the episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes this one happens to be only 18 minutes this mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle even though it only cost me 2 i still got jipped let 's hope amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	11
0	this film is a stunning tribute to the memory of all the victims of this tragedy and to all the heros who contributed to our triumph of the american spirit	11
0	a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there 's no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it 's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film does n't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they 'll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them	11
0	csi is great and downloading was very easy this is my fourth video and i 've only had problems with one and amazon quickly walked me through fixing it gotta agree with a huck on the dsl though while it 's certainly useable the higher speed of cable would be great	11
0	this is a monumental movie that helped to shape the identity of jamaica after its independence from britain the character work is very good and the plot gets more and more interesting as the movie goes on to top it up the soundtrack on this movie is trully great the only negative with this particular dvd is that it is slightly below par for a criterion transfer having seen quite a few criterions i can say that i was not particularly impressed with the quality on that one i am sure though that criterion must have done the best they could with whatever raw material they had available	11
1	this movie is so bad it barely deserves mention however i am a big dl fan and i am writing this in the hope that dolph will not abandon his fans he may be making movies like this just for the but i believe he is also doing irreparable damage to his career	11

1	years ago a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends and decide to keep a secret years later when they 're all in high school the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them your typical 80s horror film not very notable other than leslie nielsen and jamie lee curtis this is one prom better left unattended	11
1	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
1	this is only a portion of this episode it cuts off in the middle of a sentence	11
1	at first i did n't realize that you have to use amazon 's software to load onto the zen once i figured that out \( actually my husband figured that out \) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do i was n't able to edit the stars if i could i would give this 5 stars if you have tried some other sites for the zen they are much more difficult to use amazon 's unbox is great for the zen	11
1	shark attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage the movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver the most interesting part is all the shark footage the best scene is after the bad guy hotel owner is eaten the shark clearly shown with a hook in it 's mouth being pulled towards a boat this of course has nothing at all to do with the plot so where did this hook come from \? it was probably i was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie	11
1	but it gets one star for the brief moments that ricky jay has in the film and another for portions of alec baldwin 's performance overall this is a stinker mamet is not a good director he should stick to writing	11
0	when i watched this classic documentary i could n't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here we just would n't make it what it took for inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls body piercing hummers and rap music underneath it all is a heritage that is raw rich and admirable and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up it would be interesting to produce nanook ii and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now	11
1	i do n't think so contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script think about it take a dump on a stock and get wiped out now you are a messenger \? i do not think so i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades but this is crazy thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum yes he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote	11
1	this movie is not for you if you cannot handle movies just being flat out weird sure there are plenty of plot holes reeves is in it so do n't expect an academy award however the plot is very interesting \( again filled with tons of holes \) but i watch a movie to be entertained not to be a film critic or to analyze everything overall if you like weird movies like fear and loathing in las vegas this movie is for you if not and you like to be a nerd about movies and analyze every little detail about how true to life it may or may not be well just skip this one	11

0	i do n't recall having seen a film where the actors enjoyed more playing their roles they seemed to have had a ball	11
1	this movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made i use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies they are either worse than this one \( rare \) or better than this one as an example buffalo '66 is worse if you watch both in the same day you will surely die	11
0	this is a truly funny movie the main character is so out of her element that it is totally belivable how ridiculous she is this is one of those movies that you buy and come back to watch and invite your friends over for movie night it 's a good buy for your dvd collectio	11
0	father goose was a movie i had seen and enjoyed a long time ago i rembered the name of the film but could not find it locally i contacted amazon its was in stock and i received it in a few days i was very pleased with your quick attention to my simple request i will be coming to you for future purchases	11
0	be sure to catch the alternate views on disk 2 the view from the control booth with the director losing his mind in a good way is great they also have a beautiful day from the rooftop in boston	11
1	the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that 's a bad sign that the movie is n't going to be great \( i 'll try and remember that next time \) the only reason i am giving the fogotten 2 stars is the scene with alfe woodward you 'll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that 's it happy viewing	11

0	this is an excellent movie for the romantic type a real classic ! got it for my wife for her birthday enjoyed it very much	11
1	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	11
0	when you consider the physical condition olivier was in his performance is pretty damn good the supporting cast are mostly excellent with diana rigg a standout as a venal vicious voracious yet strangely feline and alluring regan and dorothy tutin not far behind as a grabby and lustful goneril leo mckern is the definitive gloucester	11
0	i can remeber being a little over eight years old the first time i saw this movie while i did n't understand it then i found that the music and the scenery was breath taking seeing this movie years later along with other great 's such as young bess and mary queen of scots helena carter 's and cary elwes performance 's are right up there with such great names as stuart granger and jean simmons i would recommend this movie if you like period piece movies but like i said do n't take into account that the history is a little jumbled just enjoy it for the tragic history that is burried underneath the plot	11
1	the young actor is great in this movie but the film itself is non exciting and a bit boring	11
0	flawless and beautifully rieveting the joy luck club has to be the best movie i have ever seen and probably will be the only one of it 's kind the story is beautiful and timeless and i encourage everyone to see it it makes you think of the relationships of your family and how even though this is a movie it can impact you beyond belief it will rock you to the core of your being and i am living proof	11
1	why should one buy this series \? what about the missing episodes \? are they going to be added later or this is it \? i cannot believe this would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel \? or a keyboard without the c and r keys \? i 'd like amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do	11
1	ok so claud was never a great actor and this was not his best work yes the martial arts are weak at best but i still own this movie and watch it just to see raul julia go over the top why do they still call me a warlord \? and mad \? all i want to do is to create the perfect genetic soldier not for power not for evil but for good carlos blanka will be the first of thousands they will march out of my laboratory and crush every adversary every creed every nation ! until the world is in the loving grip of the pax bisonica and peace will reign and all humanity will bow to me in humble gratitude	11
1	unless you enjoy movies that are not funny not scary and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns do not watch this series of horrible flicks putrid ! not even so bad it 's funny absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind ! heed my warning ! sucks ! !	11
1	this is my favorite production of the alice books i love the sets songs and casting it 's also very british which i think adds another great element to the mix however skip this dvd edition i got it excited to see alice's adventures in wonderland in widescreen and perhaps a better print than what 's previously been available no such luck the dvd appears to be struck from the same crappy vhs version that 's been out there for ages faded colors pan and scan in this age of dvd quality like this is such a shame	11
0	this is a beautiful movie but please have no misconceptions about what you 're getting into it is not a traditional love story it does not have a happy ending you are taken on an incredible journey and grow to love these innocent people who burn with passion then you see terrible undeserved things happen to them but it is still a wonderful achievement in the arts of filmmaking and film acting it is a story about the human costs of founding a nation among many other thought provoking things it was shamefully overlooked in 1998 and i do not understand why it has not been released on dvd i appeal to fox searchlight please dvd this soon	11
0	i had forgotten how awesome this movie is even for a grown up like me it could do without all the songs \( it was made before disney wisely decided to ditch all the cheesy singing \) but it 's brisk double layered humor more than makes up for it kids will think the gags are sufficiently silly adults will pick up on the nearly sarcastic nearly risque dialog so rare in disney animated movies plus big foot dancing to 'stayin' alive' is just freaking hilarious basically it 's just a disney movie but it 's a great \( and severely under appreciated \) disney movie	11
1	this series is being sold with missing episodes like many others here in unbox do they think their customers are so dumb \? would you buy a dvd series with a missing dvd \? what sense does this make \? what a disappointment this service is	11
1	amanda pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity but otherwise this film did nothing for me a bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests \? i ca n't even relate and they 're trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness \? yeah right ! see it if you 're a big fan of fart jokes or whatever	11
1	it 's always nice to watch famke janssen of course but i like it better when she 's either a very smart x person or a bond busting sadist this movie really wanted to scare me but sheesh and the bad guy was like an evil version of sgt carter from gomer pyle totally implausible i think the problems start in these movies when horror writers direct them	11

1	i bought this as a gift for my nephew because i loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie i'm very glad i screened it first the female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow boring and illogical i'm not very pc with old movies but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits choose one of the other disney re releases instead there are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog	11
1	i am giving this one star only because it is on vhs and not dvd i do n't even own a vcr anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house ! ! the day that they come out with all ten seasons on dvd i will buy them all and really wish i could now ! i just bought the pilot episode on dvd and am hoping that this will sell well and that they 'll go on to put all the seasons on dvd already i know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them ! !	11

1	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11
0	my almost 3 year old loves it she does n't understand a lot of it and some of the scenes are a bit 'mean spirited' but she 's been able to overlook them she and i love the music together that 's why i bought it in the first place	11
1	i hoped i could leave the theatre but i was hoping it would get better here let me put it this way 3 d suckedplot suckedactors suckedmovie suckedplease don't make a sequel ! ! !	11
1	all the promos made me think that this would be a really great sci fi story with beautiful babes all over the place well there were some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies never materialized has the art of posing been lost by modern girls \? maybe all the good directors have retired or died ! what a pity why i could n't even muster a stiff upper lip as i played this dvd through to the end in spite of my being a certifiable dirty old man \)	11
1	dont dwnld survivor thunderstorms sacrifice its my fault for not reading the whole thing you would think that the last episode would be the finale but no its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4 i didnt even get a full 45 minute episode no finale i got rippped off 1 99 dwnld not well spent dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending because they dont have that episode not even the reunion show	11

0	the breakfast club one of the best movies out there timless no matter what 's your age or what year you were born in your sure to love this movie !	11
1	not sure what is worse the horrible script or the horrible acting typical mean girl makes epiphany and changes to good person script watching schneider dress in women 's clothes for an entire movie is just creepy using lemon juice for eye drops would be more enjoyable than watching this movie	11
1	this movie is far from being anything great some of the characters do n't make any sense what so ever with the original cast leatherface 's role has been mocked people spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up leatherface the first tcm is a classic and the second tcm is great as well but leatherface tcm iii the next generation and the tcm remake have all made the texas chainsaw massacre franchise a laughing stock i really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up the only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with cgi enough is enough	11
0	but it 's the core 25 and if you look at this as its own piece then you 'll be satisfied the visuals are great gary cooper is great and ayn rand 's premise is all here and for those of you picking apart rand 's philosophy and its role in architecture yes the movie is an exaggeration the book is too that 's the point	11
0	i love anakin skywalk	11
1	a comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of heaven \( fanny ardant victoria abril \) and hell \( gael garcia bernal penelope cruz \) battling over the soul of a mexican boxer is promising but this attempt at satire full of symbolism \( hell is represented by english speaking executives for example \) is clumsily executed only rarely amusing and the superb fanny ardant is not given anything to do what a waste ! you 'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors	11
0	i love this movie and i do n't have anything bad to say about it but if you get the dvd be prepared because the movie and the audio tracks do not match so you hear an actor speak before their mouths move this drove me crazy but i still enjoyed the movie	11
0	one of the best movies of all time ! bertolucci captures it all everything is well rounded every intimate moment realistically captured the scenes the emotion the beauty and the avant guarde this is avant guarde cinema at its best it does n't isolate the viewer but wholeheartedly brings them into a brave new beautiful world lucy is leisurely looking for her father life and love in an isolated arts commune in italy you will forget where you are and how you think you should be living after seeing such free and open beauty of people and interchanging lives gorgeous	11
0	justice in the criminal justice system \? what is that but empty talk in the real world \? in hell shows how an innocent man who honorably slays his wife 's murderer finds himself brutally thrown into prison where he learns how to survive in the harsh system no macho van damme kickboxing here but a portrayal of his progressive instincts in an environment of hate a true portrayal of life in today 's world that is infected by faulty institutions who jail innocent men and corrupt power brokers who run them	11
1	curious as to why amazon would charge for this content when cbs offers it for free on the official survivor website yeah at the cbs site you have sit through 4 commercials but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs	11
1	the movie title itself says a lot the movie itself is a total scam fools people to rent or to watch it a horrible directing script and performance you 'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain dean bad movie	11

0	i purchased this a gift for a special friend as i know that she loves musicals and had this movie but only on video tape when she first opened the gift she could nothing but squeal with delight and run around the office showing everyone with much excitment she has watched the movie several times and invited other friends over to enjoy the experience i myself have watched the movie and must say it is enjoyable but not the best movie of this genre would only recommend for people who like broadway shows and musicals i'm glad i got this movie as a gift for her as i will now be remembered for many years to come	11
0	one of the best films of the seventies in my opioin charles bronson plays a professinal killer who is doublecrossed by powerful mob boss who wants bronson to join his family simple straightforward action that never lets up the ending also proves memorable when bronson realizes bronson means business in this film the guy can portray this type of chracter better than anyone else and has proved it time and time again over the years	11
1	i'm a big fan of colin firth and i was disappointed of this movie i felt sleep wish i never do on an average good movie i do not recommended if you 've seen bridget jones diaries not even close	11
1	typical of the war movies of that age very much the americans are all good clean kids who will overcome injustice i enjoyed looking at an america that was would purchase again but this is not a documentary or even a close approximation of real life	11
0	jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism \( highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled conveniences and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain \) it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long and several scenes \( notably the garden party \) would have benefited by judicious paring still the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy	11
1	this is not one of fred 's better efforts the dancing is so so and rita hayworth is among his poorest dance partners lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the astaire rogers films in spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching	11

1	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
1	an accessible story with all the elements of a great american novel was somehow transformed into a perverse worst of the worst abc afterschool specials if you had not read the book you would be unable to follow what was happening some of the worst directing and editing i have seen in a long time the original evil dead with all its flaws is a better put together film than this one this movie is flat out painful to watch you get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do it all seems so random read the book if you see this movie in a rental store just move along please nothing to see here	11
1	i love this film it 's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves i 'd have given 5 stars if it had so the minus three is for the appaling print one of the worst i 've ever seen	11
1	this has got to be one of the worst films i 've ever seen the characters are pointless and one dimensional the guy is a jerk and inspires no sympathy they have sudden fights over apparently nothing in fact there is no cause and effect in this movie at all ! things just happen randomly for no apparent reason there 's no real story the takes are boring most scenes hum along endlessly making for quite boring viewing the violent ending was n't even believable ! instead of inspiring any kind of shock or sympathy i was left just thinking what the \? \? \? really really pointless all around	11
1	my favorite show of the trek series but there 's no way i 'd buy another individual program from amazon it will only play on their downloaded player wo n't burn to dvd so ca n't play it on my television do n't bother buying this just go for the trek collection on dvd	11

1	the movie is widely considered a classic for hong kong action movies leslie cheung is a fantastic actor and i enjoyed bridgitte lin very much in chungking express so even though i do n't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies i still decided to watch this movie i was extremely disappointed the cinematography is boring and poorly done the plot is juvenile it is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys i hated the movie however i fully understand that many many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important hk movies ever made	11

0	i really enjoyed this movie the characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job if you 're looking for something heavy this is not for you this is a lighthearted movie that west indian people can relate to on many levels it is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them i have seen this alot all in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain there is good music dance and jokes cant done latah	11
1	i might have enjoyed this movie more if they had n't gutted the book which was a pretty good read the best character in the book fbi special agent pendergast is n't even in the movie and new york city police lt d'agosta is just a comic caricature of the book 's character another criticism of the movie is that almost every scene is so dark you can hardly see anything if the purpose was to create a moody scary atmosphere they went way too far see if you must but do n't expect too much	11

0	this dvd is great it brings back all the memories of the holidays as a young child it is hard to catch these shows on tv as they only air once during the holiday season my daughters love them and i love seeing their reaction to the shows good buy	11
1	to be honest with you i thought the movie was really bad the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky \( rodney eastman \) was in the movie \( for about 5 mins \) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	11
1	i have bought 2 seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show	11
1	i used to think this film was okay but it 's really lame he 's going home only cause he wants a car shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season	11
1	the dane cook episode is the same one that it on his harmful if swallowed c d the c d also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long the one star rating is not based on the content it is based upon amazon not sharing this fact with customers	11
0	great shows about binky taking up cycling and learning to challenge himself there 's a cycling champion vance legstrong who inspires him to succeed \( wonder who that character is modeled after \) 'operation dw' is about dw having surgery to get tubes put in her ears some really funny stuff in this one but that 's pretty much par for the course with the dw based episodes	11
1	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after \? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare i would n't	11
1	i downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode not only did i get charged but when i cancelled the download to contact about the charge i was told i had to finish downloading before they could refund once it finished downloading it did n't play anyway i gave up	11

0	this is a masterpiece of cinema after watching robert mulligan 's more famous \( to me \) movies to kill a mockingbird and summer of '42 i found this jewel i did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is directors like ford hawks lubitsch or vidor and capra are long gone and so is cinema as art but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it although it may only last a blink of an eye i am off to check out come september now who is this robert mulligan anyway \? lovable little gem	11
1	one of the worst films of a generation many talented comedic \( dave thomas colleen camp \) were wasted in this decrepit piece of digital doggeral	11
0	i really did like this movie and the different kind of story it was very imaginative and well acted the story was very scarey at times and gorey as well the only problem with the movie is that the director covered up ezra godden 's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie other than that if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town 's people peeling off the faces of it 's visitors then this movie is for you	11
0	this is a movie i have been looking for for a long time this is an excellent movie from elvis i am really satisfied i recommend this movie to all elvis fans	11
0	truely speaking this is a very hilarious episode must see for every one	11
1	i had the clever idea to compare this version with the new movie what a mistake the original pink panther is an absolute bore there is really no story essentially peter sellers spends much of the movie trying to get his wife in bed major parts of the story make no sense do n't waste your time	11

0	the newly released double disc edition of the towering inferno with its enhanced picture and sound not to mention the additional poignancy of its parallels to 9 11 cements its place in hollywood history as perhaps the greatest fictional disaster film ever	11
0	i enjoyed the film it was uncanny bizarre and colorful wow it' was a nice family movie	11
0	this movie is so good i ca n't even find it anywhere if you come across a copy of this buy it it is reminissant of american history x or slc punk in the fact that it is mostly about teen aged boys comming of age while the first two movies were aimed at a pirticualy sceen this will hit home for the rest of us drugs are bad ! !	11

1	this movie was ok i do prefer the messenger starring milla jovovich milla is exceptional in that version	11
1	this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he 's suffered in cuba and that 's about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what 's going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it 's trying to convey it 's lost in the plotless story	11
1	it starts out as one of those movies where there are a lot of unrelated characters that you think will connect in the end and about 2 3 through the entire story line breaks down into mass confusion	11
1	i downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion this is the first of two downloads that did n't play i know it was not my computer because i did download three that played ok	11
1	i'm a fan of ncis but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd 's area released months behind those in the usa why is this only available to those in the usa \?	11
1	nicky cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi	11
1	have n't read the book so ca n't compare but the relic on film is simply pathetic yes it 's a monster movie the problem is this movie is no better than most of its genre and worse than some the monster looks like a refugee from one of the star wars episodes the acting and dialogue are terrible what a yawner !	11
1	dear film company jackasses surely you know we already hate you for your greed why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like the great santini and cutting them to full screen \? yet another fine film marred no doubt by some big company 's desire to cut corners burn hollywood burn	11

1	over done is the best way to describe this over the top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a stolen video camera	11
0	fantastic film memticulous and carefully built loaded of the highest suspense you may expect in this clever film noir eastwood is an outsider he is not a detective but a jewel thief who watchs something he never had to see this brutal murderer will reach the highest governement levels in which a very well planned chase will be made behind the traces of eastwood a great script hackman is absolute convincing in the best role which he has represented more than any one else the immoral corrupt decadent and perverse villain intelligent puzzle and artistic film prove once more than industry and craft may join one of the best films in his career	11
1	everything is this movie seems out of place the old cliche quot good cop bad cop quot lived by sutherland and his pal does n't work at all ! dridget is in an awkward performance totally unconvincing unreal flat anyway it serves to study how a movie with so good cast can be a tremendous waste of time	11
1	this movie is watchable but barely its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions and see leatherface as a never mind youllhave to see for yourselves we have a yound renee zellweger in this one	11

0	this three part television production by the bbc released in 1999 is one of the finest films you 'll see in a while the acting is brilliant especially the performance by lindsay duncan the direction is extraordinary and the plot is most unusual \( if improbable \) the production is flawed only by a weak musical score the real question is how did this superb film ever get made in a media devoted to pleasing teenagers and adult sickos \? do n't miss it	11
1	this is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw i took a girl ona date for this movie and wow what a mistake the movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more	11
0	the pang of lost chances and the breakup of friendships made during shared experiences whether it be high school college or any specific period of life everytime i see fandango the experience and emotions of finishing college and leaving friends made during that time hits me all over again as other reviewers have noted the soundtrack is especially masterful \( the use of pat metheny during the wedding sequence is a particular favorite	11
1	i was really disappointed with this entry even though jason takes manhattan is n't much better ! the dvd treatment is way to good for this film if you want to complete the friday series it should be seen as it does set up for the freddy vs jason movie	11
0	from the first day i watched this video i have picked up so many musical ideas to apply to nearly every genre of music i play \( and being a military rock band bassist i play a lot of different genres \) this video will without a doubt help you become a better player	11
1	nothing but a lame excuse to show the overrated barrymore 's face on the screen again	11
0	let me start out this review by saying that this anime should be a martar for other anime to follow because it is an amazing anime the plot is basically a cybernetic government agent major motoko kusanagi who goes and tries to catch a computer virus called the puppet master from start to finish this movie is amazing with great animation and storyline i think almost everybody should be able to see it as long as they are mature enough there is a lot of violence and some language also some slight nudity but very non sexual overall i think this is one of the best anime ever	11
0	this was purchased as a gift for a co worker who is adopting a child from china therefore i did not open it nor view it the recipient is now overseas picking up their daughter so i know they have n't had the opportunity to view it but being from sesame street what can you lose	11
1	and i can remember some of the scenes to this day \( i'm 49 now \) i was 16 my friend 17 at the time i used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days and after that movie i did n't for a long time at the time it was a really scary film and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story which only added to the starkness of it of course as some have opined here what is perceived as horrifying then and what 's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas horror and brutality technology in films has definitely and i use this word wryly evolved	11
1	i dont wont to download it i wont it all on dvd this is waste mone	11
0	just got done watching the show and it was awesome of course i had to download the tool how else do you get started \? once it downloaded it worked very well and the video was right there to watch when i was ready note to self get cable dsl is a slow download but it worked great and the picture quality was awesome no commercials ! i did n't have any troubles installing it on my computer and the help tool walked me through it	11
1	very bizzare movie ! not for kids or anyone who is prudish ! can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it	11
0	just one of those classics i'm in the mood for once in a while and needed to replace my vhs version excellent copy on cd very happy with it	11
1	this movie was even more ignorant \( in a bad way \) compared to that other movie the stupids and i thought that movie was ignorantly bad as well the name of the movie \( dumberer \) explains how retarded and unfunny this movie really is the old dumb and dumber movie with jim carrey and jeff daniels is way better than this sorry excuse for comedy it was part of a classic comedy which made lots of people laugh do n't waste your money on this sorry excuse for comedy if you like dumb and dumber go for the unrated never before seen film of the old dumb and dumber instead it 's worth every penny for comedy fans	11
1	i am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company 's software the vid is encrypted so that you need amazon 's player to view it blah you 're better off buying the dvd for 20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the dvd somewhere other than your own computer	11
0	eisenstein 's verve has never been questioned even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times ' to reference hannah arendt this feature is worth anyone 's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description	11
0	a light hearted but still kind of sas movie poweful	11
0	ive seen them live in norwich \( england \) and they were wonderful its a little slow to start but with wonderful light humour and sound that have to be heard live to belive a wonderful performance from 6 men who are all in their own way geourgus and extreamly talented you will leave tired for them i brought the dvd but it doesnt give you the real thing if their in a town near you go their worth every penny to see im not a dance person but oh how i wish now i was ! ! ! ! ! wonderful breathtaking and loud	11
1	we bought 2 of these and neither one keeps the wipes moist or warm save your mone	12
1	i was so excited about this product because it was sold out everywhere i looked so i figured it must be awesome not so it is loud which freaked out my 8 month old and did not suck the stuff out of his nose very well i 've tried every aspirator on the market and nothing works better than the one they use at the hospital i took that one home with me and urge you to do the same \) very disappointed	12
1	i am so disappointed by another avent product that is just no good short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak my son 's cups have leaked on him on the floor in his diaper bag and in the car i do n't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star mom 's have enough too do running around cleaning after leaky unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the avent magic cup	12
0	absolutely love it and it 's a great quality too for this price \? \? \? \? i just ca n't believe it ! !	12
1	i bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same other covers i 've seen just slip on this one has to be tied on also it does n't cover the entire cart there is an opening that my baby 's fingers always find where he can touch the icky cart handle not a great product spend the extra money and buy the better one	12
0	i orignally bought this to hold all of my babies bath things it got too heavy everything would n't fit so now i use it to hold his baby tylenol etc it is really nice	12
0	i was surprised at what a good size this rug was it matches the bedding perfect the only negative thing i can say about it is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it i put it right in front of my son 's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib it could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place	12
0	we love this tub still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old the incline position is great when they are n't quite ready to sit on their own we used to just place this over our kitchen sink give her baths there now we place it inside our regular bathtub because she is n't quite ready to be in the big tub yet	12
1	we purchased this because of the walkie talkie feature between the 2 parent units do n't bother whenever any of the 3 units get within 10 feet of each other they let out a squeal that would wake the neighbor 's baby ! what 's the point of having a feature that allows you to clip the parent unit onto your belt if you ca n't then walk into the baby 's room wearing it without it sounding like a police siren \? \? \? \? they are getting returned right away	12
1	what more can i say \? these bottles leak all over the place i switched to dr brown 's and they have been great no leaks and my son spits up less do not buy avent bottles and nipples they leak like crazy and cause a huge mess	12
0	these are one of two brands that my daughter does not soak through in the night they wash up nicely and seem as good as the day i bought them my only wish is that they had fold back laundry tabs for the velcro they stick to other things in the wash i think this puts extra wear on the velcro too	12
1	we did read the directions and the product still works sporadically my wife is a physician ! the leaking problem is incredibly frustrating especially when the baby is crying buy anything else you will be very disappointed especially at this price point	12
1	do n't buy this humidifier ! it is much too loud	12
1	this idea is nice but the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap next the tray is hard to get off and wash next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray and that is really hard to get off by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash unless you are super woman i would not bu	12
0	this seat is wonderful my daughter ca n't quite sit on her own yet but this keeps her secure and comfortable make sure you loop the belt around your child and the cart or high chair this seat is small and very easy to use it 's a great product	12
1	this bra is very comfortable once on getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head it rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body as far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed which with a baby is all you usually have to work with the star rating is only for comfort 0 stars for function	12
0	put together well with a nice assortment of items in the bag nice gift all by itself for the expectant mo	12
0	my baby is now 5 months old and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	12
1	i love the other sleep sacks you can see my full review of them on their web pages but this sack has different fabric which i really really do n't like it is n't actually quilted it is woven to look like it is the material is such that it attracts hair and lint to it in the dryer and it catches in the fabric so it takes a bit of light tugging to get it off it also catches on any hang nails or rough skin when it is warm i use the cotton sleep sacks and when it is cold i use the fleece \( polyester \) ones great sacks just annoying fabric with this one	12
0	i bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and i am so glad i had it ! i used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller there are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it my daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep she loved being able to see everything around her at our level i am 5'3 and my husband is 6'1 and we both wore it comfortably i would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller	12
1	for the first couple of weeks the snack trap worked perfectly after that my daughter \( 7 months old \) figured out how to remove the top \( it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware but easily removed \) and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping throwing or shaking the snacks all around the house on the positive side the flaps for the top are very soft and when she does reach in there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers if only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on then this would work perfectly as it is my daughter loves it but we hate cleaning up the mess	12
0	love these i use them everywhere i really ca n't imagine not having them since my son throws down all plates and napkins still	12
0	its a little hard to adjust but its definitely worth it we 've used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller folds away easily and does n't take up a lot of space i also love the pockets on the sides where i can store my keys phone water bottle etc	12
1	i bought this pump because it had the medela name and i thought it was reliable i was wrong this is the worst pump in the world everything the other poster said is true this is the worst breastpump i would not recommend this breastpump to anyone	12
0	i was told to get the diaper genie from many people but liked the looks and reviews of the diaper dekor so decided to put it on my registry i am so glad i did i have only had to empty it about every 6 7days and it is simple and odor free even when full there is no odor ! i didnt need to put in a refill for 3months the refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts in comparison its cheaper ! i would recommend this to anyone	12
0	this item is a godsend and one of the most useful things i received ! i cannot imagine my day without it my daughter loves it !	12
0	our 21 month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it ! it does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys the sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or i need to use our regular tub	12
1	i do n't even know where to begin eeyore has a creepy voice that scared both of my kids \( 1 1 2 and 6 months old \) instead of getting my daughter to crawl with him she would cover her face and cry ! he would go off all by himself which was really creepy in the middle of the night and he broke after a couple of months now his voice is distorted and we are going to yard sale him to get him out of the house he 's defantly not worth the mone	12
0	i have a climber ! she could climb out of her crib at age 13 months she was way too young for a bed we also have the crib tent ii and both items have allowed us to feel our now 22 month old daughter is safely in her crib at night not roaming her room or house while we sleep it was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room putting a mattress on the floor and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe life saver	12
0	this is a great sterilizer it 's chamber is big enough to holder 4 to 5 bottles wide neck bottles and the tray can hold quite a few nipples and cap rings i bought it when my son was born and after a year i'm still using it it works great saves time and has an auto shut off function when the steaming cycle is complete	12
1	the walker has a few flaws first of all the toy bar on the front table is not ideal it is too close to the child and only a few inches away from the child 's head my son keeps bumping his forhead on the toybar when he is riding in the walker constantly the seat is too tight and the crotch area on the seat is too high it should be roomier and drop lower	12
1	i bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier this bag was ok to start and fit my britax \( a feat in itself \) but 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it broke i would not buy it i emailed the company and have yet to hear back	12
1	we got 2 of these and had the same problem with both the cloth on this cover already had some snags on it when we took it out of the package after washing it as directed it has gotten even worse it has strings hanging all over it it 's a very useful item but the quality of the fabric is terrible ! a friend of mine had the same problem and she recommends the especially for baby brand \( less expensive and better quality \)	12
1	i would n't let my dog sleep on these sheets they are of the worst quality imaginable we took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit perfectly i recommend the koala baby name brand porta rib sheet they are available at bru and have elastic all the way around making for a snug fit and the quality is 1000 times improved over the pnp sheets	12
1	not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet it seems that first years has discontinued the product at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website we searched for model 4290 the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer apparently they do n't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued furthermore the site is full of broken image links the thermometer works well but without probe covers it 's not a good investment you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers if the store you 're buying the thermometer at does n't have covers there find another product with covers available	12
0	my wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old we feed our daughter with bottles \( mix formula with breast milk \) and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref \( my wife did breast bumping \) and mix with formula we use this warmer all the time also when we travel out this one is quite useful generally with only a little small amount of water the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag \( well not compact bag though \)	12
0	i love this simply designed sturdy potty my son loves it which is most important he has no trouble sitting down on it no pinching no crampedness no tipping over the well sized arm rests help him up down the splash gaurd is high enough to prevent him peeing all over ! having only 2 pieces no crevices or anywhere for stuff to get trapped it is so incredibly easy to clean the first few days we had it my son thought it was so comfy that he would bring into the living room to sit on read books ! great product great price i am now planning on getting another one to leave at my mother 's	12
1	i bought this product for my 3yr old at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times at first she did n't want to sit on it again amp she cried when i took her to the bathroom but i told her i would sit her on it amp i would lift her off since i have been doing this she has n't been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched	12
1	after reading all the rave reviews we put pupsqueak on our baby 's registry but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he did n't work we tried exchanging him for another one at babies r us but we could n't find one that worked so instead we exchanged him for the dinosaur \( i forget his name \) our daughter loves him since he 's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her she loves falling asleep holding onto mr dyno	12
0	we have n't used this set yet because our baby is due in june but have set it up in our crib the fabrics are very nice and contemporary looking the bumper fits well in our crib and the tags say all the fabrics are 100 cotton except the back side of the comforter which is a fleece type material and that is 100 polyester we are very happy with this set for our future little girl	12
0	i purchased this despite the reviews i read out of desperation ! but have been very happy with the fit on my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet it is a little thin however i use a carter 's mattress pad underneath anyway so i am not concerned with absorbancy it does the job as a nice surface to lay my son 's head on and i purchased one more in navy to switch out when it is laundry time	12
0	a good friend has this for her daughter i fell in love with it when i saw it completely adorable and works like a charm bought one as a baby gift as well but i 'd kinda like one myself	12
1	i have a volvo 960 sedan and wanted to use the seat saver in the middle seat and it did not work the bottom section was too large for the space between the seat belt buckle and did not allow the carseat base to be properly placed my friend has one of those nylon seat protectors and it is much better	12
1	i used the quilted sheet for the first time when my baby was 6 months old he woke up the next morning with his face raw and irritated the thread from the quilting is just too abrasive on his delicate skin i wo n't ever use it again	12
0	i love this potty chair ! ! it is so simple and that is what i like about it simple to use simple to clean my little boy loves it	12
0	i love this carrier \( i bought it in feb 2007 \) my daughter loves it too she can sleep very well in it the only problem is it can only hold up to 22lb while mine is already 17lb \( she is only 3 months \) i guess i do n't have too much time to use it if this company could develop a one which suits for big baby i will definitely buy it ji	12
0	i love this sack and highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads before i purchased this i found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice ! ! !	12
1	i have seen this product \( and others similar to it \) as an rn we encouraged prospective parents to refrain from being drawn in by the cuteness of items that are geared only to be sold not to be useful although each category of item in this kit is certainly useful and some essential it is far better to spend your money on the items purchased separately in this way you can check for quality and longevity put together your own kit	12
1	i have many of the fisher price items and have most of the rainforest products but found this disappointing child showed very little interest in it and had no growth potential for her i will continue buying the rainforest collection hope to have better luck	12
0	she really enjoyed tummy time on this mat loves watching the fish and has toys that she can reach and grab	12
1	for the price of this cradle swing i 'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than i got first the stand seemed a little wobbly you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they do n't lock into an optimal position even worse however is that after less than two days of use the lights sound and mobile stopped working calls to customer service were a complete waste of time and i ended up returning the item while the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable i 'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive papasan cradle swing	12
0	they 're a little pricey but they work great they are easy to clean dry quickly and catch almost all the mess my boys make	12
0	they 're a little pricey but they work great they are easy to clean dry quickly and catch almost all the mess my boys make	12
0	i bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one this is the only one i still wear traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes i bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when i go out i sleep in the medela bra and wear it around the house i am quite large breasted and i find they have plenty of support i even do low impact aerobics in it it is worth every penny	12
0	i only occasionally feed my baby and my apartment does n't have a dishwasher i usually decide right before going out that i want to take a bottle so this disinfects everything really quick in 3 minutes as opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes and i do n't use it every days so i do n't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz i would have to sterilize it again right before using	12
0	the size is bigger than i thought but i loved it my son fits in nicely	12
1	this seat is a great concept it just does n't stay together very well i took it back to the store and they marked it as defective for a few dollars more i got the healthy care booster seat from fisher price i 've had much better luck with it	12
1	i bought the isis pump that came with these containers and also purchased a 10 pack of them at the same time after using the ones that came with the pump a few times i did n't like them they are good in the fridge but once you freeze them they tend to leak when thawing i returned the unopened 10 pack and bought some of the 4oz bottles with storage caps instead they were a little more expensive but well worth it i love those and highly reccomend them they also sell just the sealing disc if you already have plenty of bottles	12
0	i would n't eat out with my 14 month old and 4 year old without taking along a table topper for each of them the self sticking tabs on the top and bottom hold them securely in place creating a clean surface for toddlers and pre schoolers to munch on finger foods and place their utensils without worry of restaurant table germs i wish i had thought of these ! ! they 're a great invention for families on the go	12
1	i purchased this baby carrier for my 1 month old son when i put him in it he looked so uncomfortable i tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit but it still covered his face so i decided to shell out the for the infant support pillow expecting that to make a difference it did n't he still looked uncomfortable and squished only now i wasted more money my son is 21 1 2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz i ca n't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all a big disappointment if you 're looking for a carrier try the bjorn a million times better than this	12
1	had to return this item it was way too small forewarned when you order that it wo n't fit an average baby up to six months i would say it would fit up to 6 weeks at most ! ! it is very cute and would be a great addition to a bundleme \( cover \) but the company needs to reanalyze their sizing more disappointing was having to pay shipping return on a 9 item	12
1	i 've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week old son i just ca n't get it to work so that he seems comfortable he usually cries when he is in it he fell asleep in it once but he looked so contorted it 's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way and the pocket is so deep it closes over his head and i know i got the correct size i 've given up and am looking for a better sling right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day and he loves it but it 's a little cumbersome and i want him to be able to recline	12
0	i was given a swaddle me for my third child she has been my only child that slept through the night at five weeks my oldest did not sleep through the night until nine months and my second still does not i owe it all to the swaddle me but at three months she outgrew the small size i thought she was old enough to go without swaddling boy was i wrong it took me a month of sleepless nights to purchase the larger size i have had my large swaddle me for two weeks and have had two nights of trouble since then thank you swaddle me for helping me keep my sanity	12
1	i bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant i wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat watch tv or drink his sippy cup this chair was the perfect height design and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky the problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip the fault is in a joint i bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when i packed but then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two that joint is really weak too bad ! it 's such an adorable product	12
0	works great we tried other brands of gripe water which did n't seem to do much something about baby 's bliss does the trick	12
0	we struggled with 2 different monitors before we got the imonitor by graco the first 2 we tried had so much static and interference that they were useless i ca n't explain how delighted my wife and i were to hook up this monitor and hear nothing but the sounds of our baby it was better than christmas morning when we were kids ! ! ! we have wireless internet cell phones cordless phones basically if its electronic we got it despite all the potential for interfence the graco delivers chrystal clear sound with absolutely no interference a must buy for any parent	12
0	this mobile is amazing from the time she was 6 weeks old my daughter was mesmerized by the motion and the music she loves watching the animals and can be left in her crib for up to 45 minutes simply glued to the mobile although it can be noisy it does n't seem to bother her and she often falls asleep at night to the sights and sounds a must for any nursery	12
0	this is a great organizer i read the other reviews and was a bit skeptical until i received this one it is great ! we use the avent bottles and they and all of their parts fit very well there are even hooks at the bottom so hang items such a pacifiers it did take a little while to figure out how to make it not leak water on the counter but once we mastered that all is well	12
0	i got this system for my 18 mo old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was stuck they have helped prevent him from doing that any more however if he 's in the mood he can easily dismantle the entire contraption so it wo n't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to in fact the two end panels had to be removed because he would n't leave them alone all in all though i think the mesh bumpers do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys \( and pluggers \) in the crib instead of out on the floor	12
0	i bought this swing for our first child specially because it has many features overall i am happy with it and our son seems to enjoy it but few things i wish it had is one that the seat could be reclined and two is that the toys made some kind of noise to get attention overall for the price it is good	12
1	i just bought this seat for my 9 month old son i bought it for the convenience of the fold down front as good as that feature is it still causes red marks on my sons knees he is a thin baby so i do n't know how well this would work for a chubbier baby also the seat it self is slippery i have to place a rag down before i put the baby in because he will slide forward if i do n't this is very uncomfortable for him unfortunately this seems to be the only seat with the fold down front which does make taking the baby in and out easier that is really the only good thing i can say about this product	12
1	i bought this for an older model graco pack n' play we got from friends who no longer needed it the mattress measures 27 x 39 and before washing it my husband and i tried it out to see if it fit it 's too small i know it 's supposed to be snug but the mattress wo n't even lay flat with this sheet on it it seems like it 'd be a great product if only it were slightly bigger to fit properly	12
0	so far i have n't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies \( also we have n't run into issues to need it \) but i have used the nose aspirator and it 's great it 's soft and i do n't fear hurting his nose ! i'm very excited to use the rest of the products	12
1	i will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference but ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall charging for days at a time and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck i had ignored a review i read similar to the one i'm writing just before i purchased this imonitor i learned my lesson ! purchase with caution	12
1	it worked great for a few days then as i got to the bottom of the batch of wipes they were totally dry also the whole thing flooded my changing table not sure why but i am returning this unit	12
1	i too thought that since we had such great luck with avent bottles that we would love their magic cups i am constantly cleaning up leaks from these cups it seems like the lid and cup do n't seal together well enough to withstand any activity i'm sad to have to give avent a bad rating but do n't waste your money on these cups	12
1	i bought these for my daughter thinking that maybe they would n't leak like the last ones i had used they do n't leak but the stage 1 is too slow and frustrates her she 's 5 months and the stage 2 is too fast they made a huge mistake in not making more stages had i realized this before i had used them i would have taken them all back	12
1	we had to buy a new pack n play because our other one was coming apart i chose this one because of its features and colors my daughter hated this and screamed every time we put her in it we tried for days to get her to use this but she never would so we returned this and got a different that she absolutely loves	12
1	i bought this sling when i was still pregnant after my son was born i tried putting him in it but he just did n't seem secure so i threw it in the back of the closet when he turned one i dug it out again thinking it would work well as a hip carrier but it is even worse for this ! i had him in this a total of five minutes and it was awful first of all the buckles should not be placed so they hit the wearer either on the neck or the shoulder bone it is very painful with a heavier baby i took him out of it and will never touch the thing again	12
0	if you 're worried about sids \( loose blankets in the crib \) or whether or not your little one is warm at night look no more halo sleepsack wearable cotton or fleece is the way to go ! ! ! ! i love them and know that my little guy is warm during those chilly nights	12
0	if anyone asked me what baby product i would have to have it would be this product ! i love it and it is very comfortable to use one negative thing though is that the suction cups do not work very well so do n't let your child use it because they could slip i would purchase it again and would give it as a gift	12
0	this seat along with the matching step stool are great ! my daughter loves having her very own special toilet seat and step for going potty it has encouraged her to potty train it fits the toilet seat nicely and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well	12
0	my son loves this toy although i think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color he is 10 5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy a good buy and will keep them busy	12
1	sometimes it works ok sometimes it stops swinging for no reason sometimes turning on the mobile will instead turn on the music it always makes a gringing noise when swinging if it worked like it should it would be a great product i like the stars projected below when they work	12
0	the gate works perfectly however it does n't get 5 stars because the installation instructions are not very intuitive i am very handy with tools remodeling etc and i found the installation to take longer than i would have expected the latch receptacles are different sizes and the smaller one goes at the top there was a u stamped in it but no mention of that in the instructions nor did the instructions mention the size difference and that the bigger one goes on the bottom how hard would that be \? one sentence \? i went through a dry run and figured it all out but it doubled the installation time \( took 1 hour \)	12
1	we just purchased these after our 3 year old worked out how to open the covers by safety 1st and parents this cover lasted about one minute seriously ! by the time my husband was placing the third cover in our hallway of doors my son had opened the first one my husband had installed the tapered end makes this cover the easiest of all for little hands to open	12
0	i heard about these blankets from a co worker and had to order the mommie blanket for me and the pink baby blanket for my daughter they are the softest blankets i 've ever felt there 's a reason this company 's name is cloudb ! the only reason i gave this blanket 4 stars is because of the quality of the sewing the mommie velboa blanket arrived with lots of loose threads hanging off the edges not a big deal i just snipped them with a scissors but still disappointing to get such a beautiful blanket but have it look a little unfinished	12
0	i have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie talkie feature it works well and has a great range the vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep	12
0	excellent value for money our 8 month old enthusiastically used this seat as a travelling feeding chair as well as a floor chair and we would n't have managed the holidays without it ! this seat is strong and stable yet easily assembled dis assembled it folded flat to fit in our suitcase and has become a valuable travel companion with our young family we purchased this on 19 dec and it was delivered prior to christmas well done amazon	12
1	i purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better i was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly unfortunately i do n't have the original box therefore cannot return the item i am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from one step ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box through friends i have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that i wo n't be disappointed hopefully babiesrus will sell this other item in the future	12
1	i wish i would have read the reviews on this before i bought the pump this is a bad breast pump i could n't get anything out of my breasts with this except for sore nipples it has very poor suction is a pain to put together and is uncomfortable to use so do n't waste your time and money buy something different if i could have rated this a negative i would have	12
1	i have had nothing but problems with this company i was missing bolts for an item i contacted the company but it took me a month to get back to me they then told me that i need to pay 10 dollars because the parts were not under warranty took care of that but still waiting on bolts order the piece in december it is now april and still not able to assemble	12
1	i could n't wait to get it i got so excited when it finally arrived ! so i used it right away ! sooo disapointed ! it did not get anything out at all it is soooo weak ! the one from the hopital is great but broke from using it so much and then we got one from target and it works ! but this nasal clear is no good do not buy it	12
1	we could n't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker unfortunately after countless times of putting in new batteries we realized that the toy did n't work i immediately contacted kolcraft and they are sending me another toy i also wished i had gotten the one with the mirror instead i have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it and to add to that she only stays in it for about 15 20 minutes other than that i really like the walker ! lol i think it will be better once we get a new toy	12
0	we have the one with brown trim but i had to write a review here too because we just love this blanket it 's super soft the perfect size for swaddling and nice and light and still warm for baby we live in hawaii so we love how this blanket keeps the drafts off our son but does n't cause him to wake up sweaty it costs a little more than your average cotton blanket but it 's completely worth the money ! i 'd buy another in a second	12
0	i did a lot of online and store researching before i bought this seat for my 3 1 2 year old son my one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children well now i can say it works well for slim ones as well he loves the arm rests and the cup holder it is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary we liked it so much we are going to buy another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition	12
0	i love this bra ! it is very comfortable i hardly notice i have it on the soft stretchy material is perfect the closure hooks are easy to use once you use them a few times and get familiar with how to open and close them i am glad i bought this nursing bra and i highly recommend it	12
0	as im sure all mothers can relate my 9mo old son is always trying to eat the shopping cart i looked at a lot of local stores for a cover i couldnt find one that fully covered the front back and sides of the seat that wasnt 80 this one is great ! its reasonably priced wonderful bright colors and holds up well after several washings i just wish it wasnt so bulk to carry around but i guess thats the price you pay to keep him from sucking who knows what up off the carts ! !	12
1	leaking slipping ca n't use over the kitchen sink horrible design	12
0	this is a great pack'n'play it 's easy to set up and take any place the bassinet is great very sturdy and larger than another one that i have the colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby 's attention my only problem is the piece for the top whenever i try to use it the arms bow in and it does n't look very sturdy i also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground it just does n't seem very sturdy and i have tried everything other than that i am glad that i bought this !	12
0	i bought this as a gift ca n't give much opinion she told me she loved them so i give it 5 stars maybe that 's not a fair review but it 's breast pads they are always useful ! lo	12
0	when we got our changing table from a friend who no longer needed it they gave us the diaper depot as well i love how it puts everything at an arms reach without clutting the changing table it has lasted two kids before the one it 's on now so a total of three babies i guess like anything if it 's taken care of properly it wo n't break	12
0	my daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and i was always worried that she would get cold especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter i saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl ! she wears it every night now and i know she stays warm throughout the night the only suggestion i have for anyone thinking of buying this is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one mine is growing so fast that i will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long	12
1	i recently purchased this gate as i needed a gate for a space that is 93 inches wide i was so happy when i found this and for the price ! well i installed it with no problem at all but it is not secure it actually bends forward and backward with barely any pressure and when my daughter leaned against it the wooden dowels that hold the bars together actually started to break awful and very unsafe ! ! ! target com was very helpful in sending ups to pick it up	12
0	we have a very irregular iron banister with different sized spaces and bars this was the perfect solution because you can place the tie down holes wherever you need to and the ties it comes with are really long so they will fit around large or small bars we had to use a drill to make some holes further from the edge of the plastic because the hole punch it comes with would n't reach but it was very easy to do i also like this product because it does n't take away from the look of the banister or obscure vision	12
1	we also ordered the bedding and got the pillow we called baby age and they were nice but refused to honor the price and send us the bedding they should know there 's a problem by now and change this listing	12
1	the first one of these i had came apart at every seam the first time i washed it i returned it and got another i was pleased with until about the 6th washing and now it is starting to fall apart they just do n't seem to be well made enough to stand up to the frequent washes that something like a changing pad cover will have to endure	12
1	this seemed like a great idea but it does n't work very well for cloth diaper users like me i use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs however since my cloth diapers wo n't fit into the diaper organizer i'm not sure what to put there because of this there is a lot of wasted space i would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers	12
0	i like this product very much it is very soft unlike the other tubs where i was scared that my son would hit his head the only drawback i have about is the belt maybe in the next one they can come up with a good belt that would hold the infant other than that i would recommend it to anyone it looks very comfortable too especially if you have taller babies this is the best bathing system	12
0	that 's just it i love this product and i am so happy that we purchased it it saves time and space and is very safe for my children we bought 2 one for each of my children and they have been wonderful	12
1	do not buy this mattress it is not safe this mattress does not fit either of the cribs we have for our twins when i called kolcraft to inform them the cs rep was rude and insistent that this mattress was standard size and would fit and that they have n't had any complaints she also implied it was my crib that was the wrong size we have 2 cribs and the sealy matress in the crib the twins still share fits nice and snug the kolcraft has at least an inch gap and can move around quite easily	12
0	great safe and nice looking bumper ! i would recommend it without hesitation	12
1	i purchased this item from target and had to return it to the store the wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam and the foam is inserted into the cover the foam is n't the problem it 's the cover the zipper goes right down the middle so it ca n't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head neck i would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece if the zipper were on the side the product would be great	12
1	this is a great gate if you have a strong healthy back and always have two hands available but how many people with kids have both of those ! it was great at keeping my baby in the room but my 4 year old could n't open it and neither could her grandma and it made me and my husband want to cuss it is back in the box and in the return pile do n't waste your money	12
0	it works really well it 's stable \( the little guy is trying to climb \) and holds a lot	12
1	we ordered a tub from baby because which was delivered then they mistakenly sent us formula someone else ordered on route the formula fell off a ups truck and was lying in the street for over a day a neighbor saw it and gave it to us baby because contacted us saying they wanted the formula back to sell it we expressed concern that they wanted to sell baby formula that had fallen off a truck and been lying out in the street for a day they said it was n't our concern and to just give it back	12
0	you do n't need the whole kit only the loop and latch is needed if you use the plastic it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing this way you can use the softfit breastshield too	12
0	i was a bit nervous about buying these covers after reading the negative reviews but i did it anyway and i'm glad the covers are durable the color has n't faded and it still fits perfectly over the changing pad i think they 're soft enough for diaper changing i would n't put my baby to sleep on it but then who would	12
1	we have the 49mhz whisper connect and love it \( see our review of that one \) we needed a second monitor to replace a 900mhz fisher price monitor that is 4 years old and decided to try this one out we set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up we thought we must have a defective unit so we returned it and got another and we had the same problem there is no interference or static with the monitor but also no sound we 're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it	12
0	this is a great light shines stars all over the room constellations are n't quite right but they 're close the different color options are great for the price it 's a great deal	12
0	when i purchased mine there was no diaper dekor which is the larger size however i feel that we have no need for a larger one my child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers no problem ! i bought the diaper genie because i was told so many things about it and i hate it it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them i am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the diaper dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes	12
0	i love this swing my fussy first child could not live without it i had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud i called fisher price and they said that the motor will wear out with use so now mine sounds like a metronome it clicks back and forth if i had to do it all over again i would still buy this swing b c of the design i just wish that fp would build a motor that was more durable and better yet that plugs into the wall	12
0	we loved this product and our little girl loved it even more ! we used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months we have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in we never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped we believe her coordination is better because she used this so often at just 14 months she could jump with both feet off the ground it is a quality product at a reasonable price would highly recommend	12
0	this is the bmw of all highchairs it 's super sturdy and the italian leather seat is easy to care for ignore the reviews about being a pain to clean you need to clean every highchair nooks crannies and all	12
1	i was really unhappy with this lock it not only kept the one year old from opening the lid but kept everyone else in the house from opening it as well	12
0	i think for your money you get a great value for this playard it comes with an interactive musical toy that no other playard comes with anything like this it also comes with overhead bars that you can hang toys from and the baby can play with the mattress seems very comfortable and i bought this playpen because the bassinet part looked more reinforced than the others it has bars that snap in place and also has plastic parts that hang over the tops the mat can also be used as a playmat on the floor with the overhead bars	12
1	the suctions are pretty weak dont stick well to the tray also had a hard time keeping the arch standing up the arch kept bending forward and falling in my sons face when i was able to get the suctions to finally stick as soon as my son would touch it it would bend right above the suction part and it would end up in his face they should have added some kids of reinforcemnt so that it could stand upright all the time i took this back the next day i bought the sassy fascination station instead it has a giant suction at the bottom and serves its purpose even i had a hard time pulling it off the tray	12
1	i purchased two of these seats for my twins over a year ago when they were about 18 mos or so i have had consistent problems with both seats frequently popping out of the base units the sides and back height positions are set at the same levels so that is not the problem weight of the children is not an issue as the weight limit is 50 lbs per the specs and my boys are not even close to that i would not recommend these seats based upon my experience with them	12
1	i am so disgusted that i woke at 5am on black friday to drive 12 miles to walmart to purchase a dora toddler bed i held the dora toddler bed until christmas when on christmas eve i went to put it together and the pieces were package wrong and i was unable to assemble the bed at all i ended up returning the bed in exchange fr nothing i found out that they no longer carry the bed	12
0	this product was great in the first few weeks after we brought the baby home while others have said that the velcro is very loud for late night diaper changes i found that i could keep it velcro 'd on the top and just slip her legs out through the bottom my daughter really liked this but quickly outgrew it at just one month old she did n't want her arms tied down so the usefullness of the product is limited for a baby who loves being swaddled this is an indispensible item i 'll pass mine on with our hand me downs you never can tell which baby will want to be swaddled	12
1	well the fact that it is a leash was really not the problem cause i mean when you buy it you already know that ! lolmy daughter would have more tantrums wearing it than not every time i would put it on her she would scream and beg me not to put it on it was really heartbreaking on the plus side this item really taught my daughter to walk next to me and listen to me lolwe used it a couple of time and put it aside she really hated it and i felt that it caused more tention than it is worth	12
0	this is a good thing to make your home safer for your kids this is a pretty boring product but everything worked just fine	12
1	this sling was only useful for a couple months because there is no adjustable strap there are so many slings out there that are more functional and that you can use from newborn to toddle	12
0	my daughter ordered this to go with the crib shield system it 's a nice addition to the system and looks very nice	12
1	i bought this for my son who was just over 2 years old at the time within about 9 or 10 months the railing broke at the plastic hinge obviously since this is major stress point for the product it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue i was disappointed that this railing did not last longer	12
1	the ideas for the bottles interchanging is great but unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas when they 're using the bottle you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips every time my little girl uses them it seems as though she just ca n't get comfortable with them i would recommend dr brown 's or playtex ventaire bottles over any of these ultimately the convenience and features are n't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause	12
0	we have a small home and decided to opt for this type of high chair instead of a stand alone we just love it and so does our 6 month old	12
0	my baby has used this since she was 4 months old it has a sturdy wide base it has height adjusters you can recline it very secure safty belts but i do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when i buckle it thats the only thing i dislike about this highchair i dont find it hard to clean it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it 's on sale i paid full price \(	12
1	my daughter is only two months old and she slides off this thing all the time i even tried to put a towell to make it less steep but it did n't work worst yet her head would slide off the edge i guess it will work for baby who is small and less than one month old and does not move around	12
1	i went through an entire box in two days ! the fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly plus the diameter of these are much smaller than any others try gerber or lansinoh	12
1	we actually went through two of these in two weeks the first one cooked the bottom 20 wipes so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective the second one did the exact same thing ! we wasted so many wipes with this warmer since they were cooked we have even emailed the company and sent them pictures but never heard back from them save your money	12
0	a friend of mine introduced me to the babyplus system i am just now beginning my third trimester and have been using the babyplus since week 20 i enjoy the 2 hours a day i use the system i feel like i am 'doing a good thing' for my little boy on the way while using babyplus the battery cover clips snapped off i emailed customer service and they happily offered to replace the cover no questions asked babyplus is a company that seems more concerned with a positive experience for the baby rather than making sure i had all the required paperwork for replacement parts	12
1	the suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat they do come in lovely colors though	12
0	my son loved this ! i purchased this item because i was not comfortable with the idea of hanging something from a door frame i was nervous that the one that hangs from a door might somehow come down i felt that my baby was very safe in this and i could put it anywhere in the house that i was once he was walking he did n't use it again	12
0	this jumper is worth it 's weight in gold my son is 3 1 2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so i decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion at first he was a little wobbly but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around i have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper i am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy	12
1	the high walls on the snuggle nest made it impossible to try to breast feed over and pulling the baby down to the open area as suggested defeats the purpose of having the walls in the first place i would fall asleep breastfeeding and wake up later only to realize my daughter was unprotected	12
1	we had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son boy were we wrong the first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart so we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again he only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50 i would definitely not recommend this to anyone	12
1	the image showing for this spoon set is not correct the image is for bendable spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old when you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant	12
0	i wanted to respond to the other review if you choose to purchase window coverings from this set instead of making them or getting them elsewhere please know that the curtains are a darker stripe \( not the tan plaid \) but they do match the ruffle on the diaper stacker the border on the wall hangings and quilt the trim on the hamper etc it is not as if there would be this one item with an odd color or pattern	12
0	i love this containers first of all i am a big fan of the isis breast pump so these containers are perfect for me i express into these containers freeze them thaw them out replace the sealing disc with the nipple warm it up then my husband is ready to feed the baby it 's one of their times together and i get to spend time with my older children perfect	12
0	my son is a very picky eater but loves elmo this set is adorable and practical he loves the spoon and getting his food off the plate and bowl th eonly thing to be ware of is it gets very hot in the microwave even if you just put it in for 20 seconds it must cool dow	12
0	i love this product all new mothers should include this on their registry how we 've lived without it for this long i 'll never know ! it is a wonderful safety product that has been overlooked until now	12
1	we have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough the double has the same issues it 's not sturdy enough for even a modest wind	12
1	i purchased this potty for my son i thought that the royal turns would give him an interest in using it it did n't he used it once and cried ! he would not sit on it again i was very disappointed the potty would sing for now reason sometimes and every time you would touch it i do not recommend	12
1	i bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs unless you have a changing station \( or crib wherever you want to hang it \) that has slits or slots able to hold it the velcro will not hold it well and the shelves are a bit insecure it 's a great idea but just did n't pan out	12
0	my newborn loves this seat the calming music and the vibation helps calm her when she is being fussy ! easy to put together and take down if you want to take it with you great product !	12
1	i bought this set for my daughter the bedding is such a poor quality that my daughter wo n't sleep in her bed she says the sheets are itchy the comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard i would not recomend this set to anyone ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	12
0	i use it while my daughter is lying down she loves being in the tub this just makes her float it 's great as the get bigger to use like the ring would buy for a friend and totally recommend !	12
0	i would like to ditto \( and thank ! \) the reviewer who suggested the cvs brand covers after reading her review i purchased the covers from cvs com then i thought about checking at walgreen 's and sure enough they carry them \( same price as cvs 40 for 5 99 \) i just picked up a box today so i will soon have a bunch of covers but i do n't care i just love this thermometer i actually have the one with the light on it outstanding product	12
1	the monitor is ok but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new channel and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby 's room not on the parent unit ! ! ! also we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static broken signal \( only to be reset by changing the channel \) and no signal overall i am very disappointed it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly and i am goig back to my old one	12
0	my daughter recently had her second child and spends alot of time breastfeeding this product allows her to pump at her convenience she can have others hold and feed the baby while she spends some time with her other child the product works very well she said it takes a little bit of experimenting and adjusting to get it set to work best for her but it is an excellent product she previously had a less expensive product by another manufacturer and heard how good the medela brand was from a friend this brand is a pleasure to work with after using the less productive noisier pump she had before we would highly recommend this product and the product is well worth the price paid	12
0	this jogger is great i love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it no complaints in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w mo	12
1	i brought this gift for my son and his wife their daughter was born on 2 21 07 when i questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer they just did n't get around to using it i insisted they read the directions and start using it the next day my son stated wow mom this is the best baby shower gift they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked how much timed it saved them as new parents and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time my son was so thankful that i insisted he use the product	12
0	when our first child was born my wife purchased the lower model from medela with the second child and her having to go back to work sooner we decided to go with this pump and are very satisfied she uses it everyday when she is at work the price might be higher than others but think about all of the money you will save on formul	12
1	we bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter who just love to make noise with anything she also loves to stick things in her mouth because she 's teething one day she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth the metal from one of the bells cut her lip ! we let her play with the other ones still but the one with the bells is put away at least until she 's older	12
0	i love my fisher price infant toddler swing i have two of them for my twin boys they love it and i know it is safe also is it easy to get them in and out of lynne ambros	12
1	hard to install ridiculously confounding installation directions and when you 're done it 's flimsy do n't waste your money	12
0	my daughter loves this activity center i wish they would change two things about it i wish we could change out the toys and it folded up	12
1	it 's flimsy breaks at the slightest touch it 's a pain to open and close ! my 15 month old figured out that all you have to do is shake the gate a little and it opens i found this out when i was putting groceries away i went to look for her and she was on the 2nd stair from the top ! i ca n't say enough bad things about this gate it 's worthless if i could rate it minus stars i would	12
1	i bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born it is awful ! it gives strange readings like 94 5 and 95 1 when in fact i know that she has a fever ! i bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings do n't buy this its a waste of time and	12
1	same thing happened to me as the person from the previous review they sent a pink pillow instead of the crib set and will not honor the same price for the bedding set i have to send it back and they will give a refund what a hassle	12
1	i bought this stroller for when we had our second child my children are 19 mo apart i had the aria single stroller for my first and loved it this one is definitely not the same for one thing it is very hard to steer and get over bumps the wheels are always getting stuck second it is hard to close the most frustrating part is the steering issue also my aria decal fell off as well many months ago i 've only had the stroller for nine months one more thing the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun	12
1	this sounded like a great item however it has proven to be useless first it wo n't stop a child from opening the door second when the door is opened the guard falls out when the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut thus the child ca n't pinch their fingers however the catch which goes behind the door is too small enabling it to fall through	12
1	we got this as a gift and have used it 0 times it 's expensive and poorly designed a large receiving blanket works well and is cheaper easier to fold and nicer looking	12
1	we should have been much more careful and read other customers' negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them \( eventually cancelled one \) we would not recommend this item after only one wash \( despite having followed the laundry instruction \) it shrank so much that it became impossible to fit our standard crib when i tried to stretch the sides around the mattress they tore	12
0	if you need a shower gift this is it ! i got one and i love it the gerber products smell sooo good and are gentle enough for everyday bathing ! mt daughter loves to coo at the seal and loves the music cd that comes along with it i keep all of the out grown small bottles in the container and it works great ! the lotion is good smelling but you ca n't beat johnsons and johnstons pink stuff also include a bottle of that and you will havev a very happy mom to be !	12
1	we had to clean this high chair nearly every day and the process itself would take 30 minutes i am not a neat freek in any way shape or form but you kind of have to clean this frequently as the food goes into every nook and cranny if i had to buy another chair i would get a wood one we have the eddie bauer booster now that our son is older we clean that once a day with a sponge which takes all of 1 minute and take the cushion off for a super clean once a week the prima pappa is comfortable and secure in the end i realized that we did n't need all the bells and whistles	12
0	in terms of pre natal resources this is the best i have found ! the positive results are proven i can not think of a reason not to buy this product every expectant parent wants the most and best for their unborn child this system is wonderful for interacting with your child before he or she is born you will even notice a response from your baby ! it 's very exciting	12
0	i bought this chair for my third child and wish i would 've had it for the first two as well it is easy to assemble easy to use and easy to clean i like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit lay in it at a fairly young age i love the wheels because i could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner the one hand release on the tray is a dream for moms who could use eight hands ! my son seems to enjoy the toys too i only wish it came with extra trays	12
0	even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny ! it is so easy to put in the buggy ! my son is comfy and fits in it very well !	12
0	being that we had our baby in december this was a godsend instead of having to bundle her up in heavy clothes thus making it a pain in the neck to strap her into the carseat my wife or i would just clothe the baby normally and not even have to wory about a bulky jacket works great	12
0	i bought these bottles because my daughter was having trouble with the flow of other bottles they were to fast for her like the other reviews this was also the only paci she would take that did n't gag her great for little babies that ca n't control their flow control	12
0	we got this seat in a different color for our first baby we feel very secure with it easy to install and a little hint they try to get you to buy the second base for the snugride if you have two cars you do n't need it you can fasten the seat without the base the directions for it are on the seat i like that we can move the canopy to wherever the sun is to directly block it and that it 's transportable to our stroller \( bough seperatly \) it comes with a head brace whatever those things are called to cradle the head those never do anything and are pretty useless but the seat itself is great	12
0	this 2 in 1 is amazing the scent is wonderful too bad they do n't make it for adults \) a very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike it actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully i love mustela products so much that i got rid of every other product that i had that was n't mustela fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products try them and you 'll see why	12
0	i just got this item for my two story house i was able to see the crib from the upstairs nursery throughout my house and even outside the monitor is not in color so that is misleading but the picture looks grea	12
0	these cloths are awesome they smell great and do n't crumble like other brands they work well forsponge baths when there 's no time for a real bath ! love them	12
1	i was so excited to buy my son a potty seat he is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months he picked out the pooh and loved it and i love the splash guard unfortunately the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor he is not leaning over to the floor the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor this seat is quite tipsy	12
0	i purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training i like that the top has a non slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet she really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training	12
0	it 's so difficult to carry a huge diaper bag while having your baby in a carrier this product solves that problem ! and it 's cute too i was shopping at babys 'r' us recently and the sales girl asked where i got my super cute diaper bag carrier i told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item \( no word yet on whether or not they will \) i have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts it 's the ultimate in convenience and fashion	12
0	the first time i used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep \( need i say anymore \) \? it fits nearly every shopping cart it 's easy to fold and unfold and it gives me the peace of mind knowing that all of those shopping cart germs are n't coming home with us ! well worth the extra peace of mind it gives me	12
1	this toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move it ends up moving all around and i can not see in the mirror the plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat	12
0	it was nice of my ninth month wife to agree upon a diaper bag that i was n't too embarrassed to carry now that the baby 's here i 've found it to be functional as well as comfortable it easily holds enough clothes diapers and stuff and does n't feel like you 're carrying an elephant no complaints at all it 's a great bag	12
1	i will not buy these again they are tiny thick and do not tapper on the edges this means you will see the lines thru your shirts the adhesive is n't enough and the pads shifted durring the night i highly recommend the lansinoh or medela they cover more are thinner and stick better	12
0	i borrowed this pump from a mom who just used it the 8 weeks she was out of work i used it frequently \( at least twice daily \) for the 5 months i pumped at work it always worked wonderfully i never had trouble with let down or supply sometimes i filled both 8 oz bottles in a 15 minute session ! unless you have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply i ca n't imagine this pump not working great i did n't have any problems with it the whole time i used it	12
1	the idea is good but it does not sit well on oblong toilets the adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus would recommend with round toilet only	12
0	i loved having this easy swaddleme wrap ! it was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart the velcro worked really well as it gave room to grow swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two she just totally outgrew this it was great while it lasted and it 's a fantastic shower gift	12
1	with the rear facing infant seat in the recommended middle seat of our sedan this mirror limits driver visability when the mirror is positioned so the driver can see the baby in the rearview mirror a large section of the back windshield is blocked i'm glad we kept the box so we can exchange it for a different mirror	12
0	i chose the lighter one based on other reviews of the wool getting all over the baby i'm using this one this winter but putting a blanket on top of baby to protect him from the cold very good quality product	12
1	with our knobs being on the front of the stove these covers hung down over the oven door and either got in the way or were popped off on a regular basis \( or pulled off by our 16 month old \) we found it easier to just remove the knobs and put them on the counter when the stovetop was n't in use	12
1	this thermometer is totally worthless it does n't read the correct temp on myself husband or baby when my little one was sick at 3 months old this thing read 96 7 degrees on all three of us i picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm works great cost me 3 i ca n't give this one away	12
1	first of all the diapers get stuck in the lid and then the room starts to smell like baby poop yes you can use reg bags for it the only about it first day after changing the bag it smells ok but buy the 2nd wow it stinks so badly and when you open it to change the bag the smell is unbearable	12
0	i bought this beacause i needed my gate to be just a little bit wider it attached very easily and was easy to install also it is very hard to find in stores	12
0	book looks exactly like the picture and the colors are vivid and nice the only thing is the puppet holes are really small meant for small fingers so you as a parent might not be able to show your child how to use the puppet feature i like this line of books better the the bright starts and baby einstein books	12
1	i bought this product for childproofing purposes i was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer 's instructions state not to install gate against drywall \( which was not in the item description \) so i cannot use it where i needed it also the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close especially with a small child in your arms	12
1	i ordered this crib almost a month ago and i could n't be more disappointed every single piece was damaged somehow either chipped cracked discolored or stained i will never buy a storkcraft piece ever again do n't waste your time and money on this crib ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	12
0	this crib is well built and functional the drawer is a nice and convenient feature the finish is good for an inexpensive crib assembly was easy with good instructions included we plan on using this crib for our next baby as well	12
0	i bought this for my second son who is a year old i love it it 's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag after he eats i take it to the restroom and it rinses right off i 've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well \( and saves my floors ! \) i recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this ! !	12
0	i have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased ! our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age we love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry just make sure the suction cup is wet and it wo n't fall off the wall sizewize it 's basically a perfect fit in our tub which is slightly tapered from head to toe but i could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub	12
1	this product serves its purpose but does not need to cost almost 30 ! basically it 's a foam wedge with white mesh fabric over it i'm sure you can find the same product that performs as well if not better if you take the time to look	12
0	it 's perfect for people without a lot of extra room it 's very sturdy	12
0	for all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled that is incorrect it was the original hip hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves so unless you have an older model that was bought before 2 2005 you should have nothing to worry about this product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the baby bjorn i have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies	12
1	i just received this product after much research and i am really disappointed with it 's quality the mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby and the sheets provided are like an emory board scratchy and stiff my baby is too long for this so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres i just thought it would be much better than this looks like i will be returning it my daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce	12
0	as we all know you 're supposed to put your baby to sleep on his back to help prevent sids the sleepsack is a great product ! it keeps baby nice and warm yet you do n't have to worry about a blanket and there 's space down in the bottom for his feet so he 's not too restricted also the great thing is that it zips from top to bottom so you do n't have a big zipper poking baby in the face	12
1	i purchased this diaper organizer to hang on my delta luv changing table because there was no storage space on top i had high hopes for it munchkin products are usually high in quality however the cloth on this organizer sags when i tried to fill it with my wipes box baby powder and lotion as shown in the picture the pockets tipped forward and everything fell out i would n't want a toddler getting near this organizer ! a much safer option is the plastic diaper depot by prince lionheart	12
0	this is an excellent product it is such a good idea given the many warnings that are out about sids i felt reassured at night that our child would be able to breathe if she happened to roll to the sides or the ends of the crib and that she would n't get her arms or legs stuck between the slats i was expecting that the fabric would be a white cotton and was happily surprised that it is made of a white satin material we even had family members that thought that someone had made the cribshield for us	12
1	the shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small do n't waste your money it 's not worth it !	12
1	this is a great idea however if your crib has anything larger than a jenny lind style piece of wood on it it wo n't work we do n't have a sleigh style crib but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch it would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular larger style cribs everyone seems to be making buying these days	12
0	we have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it ! the peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless i used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly and i do not miss that i can cook dinner or watch a tv show in a relaxed state without worry it has always worked well and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately the picture is clear the sound is excellent you do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in but the cords are all generous in length we would go nuts without it	12
0	this is a great walker the tray has plenty of activities to keep the little one busy and the music steering wheel and button lights can easily be removed to make the tray even bigger my grandson just loves the walker and i do too because it gives him the freedom to move from place to place safely amazon sells model 14570 so do n't worry the walker is sturdy with locking wheels for when you prefer him to stay stationary also a plus is that it converts into a walk behind walker which assists the child learning to walk	12
1	i purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it which makes it impossible to close with one hand even if you do n't care about the one hand feature it is still a hassle to adjust i do not suggest buying this gate	12
1	my infant daughter got her arms free in about 60 seconds it is not a well designed blanket	12
1	this product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child not only does it give additional padding that was not intended nor tested with your safety seat but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat nhtsa \( national highway traffic safety administration \) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that after market products should not be used it also does not meet fmvss213 standards as stated in the manufacturer 's description	12
0	we took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at disney world it was great ! ! it held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses monorail etc i am very pleased with this purchase it was great to have it in the airport too the only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked but we can get a replacement	12
0	the fabric is soft and cushion and what 's most important it provides good support for my baby she loves it	12
1	i don not like these washes at all the scent is very very overpowering ! ! ! ! ! i had to mix only a little of one with another unscented brand and it is still too strong i do love the case though it is sturdy and has lots of room	12
1	i used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose the first time it happened i thought i did n't screw the top on but then it happened again after doing some research this is a common problem with these bottles	12
0	this is one of the best on the market looks good and holds tons of toys and the 2 drawers on the bottom are really nice for holding books a must buy	12
1	i found the product highly unsafe as a stroller the handle is very flimsy and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller also the wheels do not lock properly and safely its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve	12
1	this product was a big disappointment for us our baby was always covered in sweat after sleeping on the polyster based sheet he was most uncomfortable in his sleep and his back would be wet with sweat definetly not recommend this one	12
0	i have this monitor now and i'm thinking about return it back cause although i have the volume on high but still my baby 's voice still not clear but other than than it is a good monitor i did not have any problem with the battaries or stati	12
0	this baby gate is ideal for the size and price i had shopped tons of stores and websites before i had found this gate the hardware mount eye hooks are not the sturdiest but this gate definately gets the job done	12
0	i love the plug in feature there 's been many times i 've left the swing on \( have to rush to change a diaper and left it on \) true it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls the swing is n't incredibly fast but for my 2 month old it 's worked well there are two volume levels for the music but i 've only used the lowest setting	12
0	this bag is great for a short trip it has enough space for a few pampers up to 2 bottles it depends on how well you can compact objects into a space im a pro with packing things away neatly in a small space so this bag works good for me !	12
0	if they made one of these things for adults i 'd get one ! ! my daughter loves this thing it 's got that crinkle sounding paper that babies seem to love and spins really easily the colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands i have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these	12
1	too loud and the water evaporates way too quickly i feel like i'm constantly filling the container w water though my son is a sound sleeper it is difficult to hear him through the baby monitor b c of the loudness of the humidificr i would not buy this item	12
1	do not like this productit is very hard to get rail under bedpops out of rails track and it is sooo hard to get back in trac	12
1	i was really hopeful about this diaper bag when i ordered it through amazon the size is small and convenient but i found it awkward when placing it around my arm and neck also the clasp broke after i had it for only 2 weeks ! i am really disappointed and would recommend looking elsewhere for a diaper bag	12
1	my son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long he wasnt the tiniest baby i tried putting him in the sling and it just looks like he 's falling and being enveloped by this huge orange thing it 's the worst product ever i am definitely not using it and will probably donate it to goodwill	12
0	the crib tent is great ! we originally got it to keep our cats out but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too \) until at 27 months he learned how to reach through the crib slats undo the zipper ! ! ! ! o so now we 're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week ! it is hard to change sheets with the crib tent but just get the ultimate crib sheet it 's a piece of cake ! \) also it is possible to put down the side rail of the crib but this does lower the tent too can bop you in the head	12
1	i would have rated this item 0 stars if that were an option we discovered approximately a year after installing these that the plastic strap had become so brittle that it snapped in two with little manipulation fortunately we discovered this because we were moving not because a piece of furniture fell i shudder to think what might have happened if our furniture had tipped	12
1	very useless pants i bought them and tried them on my toddler twins and they did not work at all on a boy or girl and i did buy the correct size they even leaked when used over diapers at night they bascially do nothing	12
1	did not work at all ! had to return it ! we prefer the tinkle toons potty with a moisture sensor the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work	12
0	my daughter received this as a gift from mommy when she was about 3 1 2 months at first she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face but if you take off a ring take it higher your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy the only complaint i have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child the mirror distorts your child 's vision so i took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it ! my daughter loves it she could be eating her breakfast or sitting in her swing and all she 'll do is stare at her playmat ! a definite must for all parents	12
1	i got this swing and i will be talking it back i put it on 5 and it will not move i do n't know what it would be like with the baby in it i just tryed it	12
1	i gave my father in law a couple ideas for my son 's \( 1 year old \) christmas gift and this was one of the items boy do i regret giving him this as an idea it is a cheaply constructed toy the bus 's hood does n't even work correctly the toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise ! the toy held my son 's attention for less than 5 minutes my suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market skip this one	12
0	i am quite satisfied with this product overall sometimes it is too sensative and gets electrical interferrence during armer weaather when the window was opened i also picked up air traffic but over all it is a very good product	12
1	i thought these would be great specially for the but i was soo wrong ! ! i 've only washed them once to have everything clean b f baby gets here and they are covered in fuzz balls ! ! the fleese is covered in lil balls and strings of balls way to many to even remove by hand and on top of that on some of the edges the layers just came apart at the seam ! ! ! it looks like a 20yr old fallen apart hand me down after one wash ! ! do not waste your time or money ! !	12
0	i love the 5 point harness my daughter needed to get out of the car seat but still need more than a seat belt this seat was easy to install and we love it	12
0	it works great for me i have 2 floor 2 kids 2 cats and before i did n't know what going on in my house now i can hear any sound guests coming kids playing watching tv and even when cats jump on dining table to steel some food it makes some fone sound on max volume but i do n't care i just reduse volume or change unit position i strongly recomend this monitor	12
1	this is a cute idea but the suction cups are misshapen and do n't stick to my son 's highchair at all very disappointing	12
0	this item is worth more than the cost it is a most have at home with a new born baby expecially 1st time parent like me i can get to do other things once my baby is asleep and i can even hear my baby 's heart beat when am somewhere else in the house worth more than trhe cos	12
1	great idea but a few more pennies could have been added to construction it would be a better idea to put the money toward a changing table really	12
0	this seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean i am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads it 's almost porous ! if you get this changing pad plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean	12
0	out of all the department stores here i got a recommendation to choose the titan over the triumph for the easness it got noted as lighter and easier to deal with i secound the so far so good comment earlier its comfortable than most seats i have shopped for besides the 1 britax that i have yet to experience \)	12
0	this is such a versatile chair love the way you can fold it down compactly yet it 's incredibly sturdy with the wide base when being used the tray stores on the back legs when not in use nice touch for the reviewer who complained that the thing that separates the legs is attached to the tray you can use the harness system to keep your child in place while removing the tray plus it 's easy to remove the top part of the tray and leave the base to keep the child secure while you clean up my 6 month old loves to sit with us at the table with some toys on the tray terrific product to keep babies happy and parents sane during mealtime	12
0	not sure what all the fuss is regarding assembly i just unpacked and assembled it a few minutes ago with no trouble assemble is probably too strong a word there is no actual assembly or tools involved as for the weight maybe 15 pounds certainly nowhere near 50 the instructions seemed sufficient although i did n't really need to use them basically if the fear of difficult assembly reported here is your only concern do n't let that stand in the way of choosing this item	12
0	hi this is the 5th gate we have had on the top of our stairs some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over this one is great i love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble !	12
1	this worked great for a couple months then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise the gears must be slipping my poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move then gets scared at the loud clicking popping noise and starts crying really sad	12
0	my little girl loves this play space ! the colors and over head bar keep her amused for long enough that i can get dinner on or help with home work the only thing that might make it better would be if the music in the push button play mat lasted longer than 2 minutes	12
1	this product is a mess i cant believe it actually sterilizes bottles and nipples i ended up having to wash them and boil the old fashioned way it builds up nasty mineral deposits and it lets water out when you pick up the lid it really is flushing 50 down the drain you need a whole role of bounty paper towels to clean after this jun	12
1	they are messy when they opened i get milk on my hands and they cost way too much i do n't have much room in my freezer when you buy the refills you have to purchase the tops and the containers seperate it 's like 17 for ten	12
1	i thought this would be a great idea to keep the jars in but really it took up too much counter space i ended up putting it away and putting the jars into all the nooks and crannies in my cupboards as i personally do not have the space to waste for something that is completely unnecessary i found save your money	12
1	nine days from mn to pa seems too long perhaps target direct got process problems i am not satisified got the same three pack of bottles which i bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local cvs for 1 50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it	12
0	my baby had very bad reflux and pediatrician told us not to move her to her room my fear was that she would get use to sleep in our bedroom and moving her became a nightmare when reflux got better at month 4 we finally got to move her and for us this monitor became a very useful tool it has rechargeable batteries image and sound are clear enough night vision works perfect monitor is not bulky at all \( no color at all though \) and we managed to tie camera to the crib 's headboard and worked great for us	12
1	i just received this sleep positioner today and it is nothing like what i expected the description makes it sound like the wedge is adjustable but i do n't quite get how to adjust this it also says that there is a blanket maybe i misunderstood the description because there is no blanket here i imagined the wedge would prop the baby up much more than it does at the thickest layer the wedge is maybe 2 1 2 inches thick i'm pretty disappointed i thought this was going to be the answer to my baby 's sleep problems	12
0	having only used it once as my baby is just now able to eat table foods when we go out to eat it worked wonderful having a clean place to put her food on was nice as you never know just how clean the tables really are	12
1	i ca n't begin to convey the frustration i felt when trying to use the refill i struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too tight bag over the cartridge the diaper dekor works wonderfully as a single use item but at about 30 40 a pop it is the most expensive garbage can outside of ted kozolowski 's apartment the printed instructions were clear it 's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do	12
0	i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help \( after she was diagnosed we were given zantac but still used this as well ! \) it 's a true godsend we 'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto she was content ! ! ! this works far better than mylicon it is expensive but it is completely worth the price we called it 'liquid gold' in our house	12
1	do n't bother with these they are expensive for only 4 bottles and totally unnecessary it is much easier to buy storage bags if you are pumping full time you will be storing alot more than 4 bottles at a time i also found that i did not like these bottles for feeding because they do nothing to prevent air from entering baby 's belly and the result is gas or worse colic they also flow too fast for newborns	12
1	my daughter has tipped this stool over 2 times ! i am returning it first thing in the morning i should have never let her on it a second time if she steps down on it on one side the whole thing tips over please do not buy this product	12
1	i spent a lot of time researching strollers and after reading all of the reviews for the aria i decided to register for one out of the box it was fairly easy to assemble and lightweight but i have not been pleased with it since the shoulder straps on the 5 point harness are cheap and fall out of the back of the seat the snack cup has never stayed in place steering this stroller is impossible we took it to disney last month and i almost left it in florida all in all i expected a lot more from peg perego	12
0	i ordered this at christmas with the free super saver shipping the crib arrived within a week assembly was simple and the crib feels very sturdy and stable it 's attractive but my only complaints are 1 \) it did arrive with about five different chipped gouged areas in the white paint \( this was easily remedied by touching up with white paint \) and 2 \) the bolts are exposed on the crib it would have looked better if they had provided caps overall i'm very happy with the crib and the price ca n't wait to use it for my little girl who is due in may	12
0	we tried three other brands and types of gates on the market two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing 66 ! the two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install this evenflo gate was put together installed and in full use within 30 minutes of arriving and the dogs have n't been able to budge it one inch plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls great product at a bargain price we 're ordering three more	12
1	i bought these because they come with foam inserts to help collect leakage i'm a 38 dd and use the large flange for my medela pump so i too found the sharp edge that contacts the breast was cutting into my sore areola nipple the ameda shells had a round edge and were much more comfortable although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend \( great proper latch ! \) and treatment for a mild yeast infection hope this helps	12
1	i tried to use these to relieve the pain but they did not work for me they were hot and of course they also showed right through any top i was wearing i had too much company after having my baby to use these they required too much work and attention	12
1	unfortunately you are correct these are not the same premium heavyweight cloth diapers that used to come from gerber when i called the company \( i use these cloth diapers in my business \) to ask they told me this was the same product it is not they quilt and wrinkle after one washing and just do n't hold up their shape in general amazon needs to update their site because the packaging has changed as well i miss the old diapers !	12
1	i ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail 3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements they said it would take 2 to 3 weeks its been 3 weeks when i called again they said it would take another 2 weeks how hard is it to get replacements \? \? my baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces would like to get the nursery done preferrably before my child goes to college we purposely ordered it early to give us time but apparently that wasnt enough i tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it	12
0	it is very sturdy but the brush broke after only 3 weeks i have searched the web and ca n't find anywhere to buy a replacement brush for this item so the whole thing does n't look quite as good with a brush that does n't match	12
1	i do n't have an abundance of money but i would definitely pay double if the quality of the sheets was better i do n't even want to know what the thread count is on these sheets from what i understand these are the only sheets that fit the thing so i guess i'm just out of luck hope to see an alternative to these sheets real soon	12
0	we 've used this since my daughter was about 7 1 2 months old she 's now 2 1 2 and we 've never had any problems with it this is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall park etc the sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too we 've never used the rain cover so i ca n't comment on that it does n't have a storage basket but i do n't know many umbrella strollers that do for longer trips we just take our full size combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option i would definitely recommend this stroller for a light quick outing stroller to keep in the car	12
0	but there are 2 things i do n't like one being that the toys hanging from the bar are too low my sons knees hit it and he is only 6 weeks old second being that the continuous play songs do n't actually continually play it actually pauses for about 1 2 minutes my son will fall asleep to the music then it pauses and starts up again waking him i do love the vibration feature which is the main reason i bought it all in all it is worth it	12
0	our son got these blocks when he was 2 months old my husband enjoyed them more at first but by the time our son was 5 months old he loved playing with these ! he probably could n't hold on to them well until he was 5 months old so that is why he enjoyed them more at this age than earlier at 10 months he still enjoys playing with them they have lasted through both children i would highly recommend these blocks for infants and so far even into the toddler age he enjoys playing with them	12
1	i recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide within one week of use the wood splintered apart in the center rendering it completely unusable i am returning the gate and puchasing the more expensive metal type this gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for	12
0	i bought elmo underwear from ebay with a sports theme and was done training in a couple of weeks the real underwear incentive did the trick so then i bought more underwear as a reward i got wiggles thomas the tank and nemo underwear from ebay	12
0	i loved this ! he was always right next to me but in a safe and separate space it folds up smaller than a pack and play takes up very little room next to the bed and has a netted tent cover for the summer to protect from mosquitos \( or your cat who is dying to sleep with the baby	12
1	do not buy this or any item from baby age their customer service is horrible amazon should remove all of their listings	12
1	it worked great the first time my 14 month old son used it but the second time he figured out how to take the lid off and spilled his cheerios everywhere i tried it a few more times after that and got same result the lid is way too easy to remove	12
1	i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow i returned it	12
0	for all new and expecting mothers it 's good to get a little help	12
0	this is a well constructed cute bounce seat and my baby loves it i am very pleased with the purchas	12
1	i got this potty for my baby shower i registered for it because it was safety first and most of their products are excellent i set it out to introduce it to my son \( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet \) we never actually used it since the top of the seat and i mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart instead we bought a plain potty seat by graco and it is excellent !	12
0	my son loves this mobile it is a bit quiet but still keeps his attention and he loves to watch the leaves and animals move around	12
1	maybe in time i will figure this plate out but i cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart use the suction clean it out it may seem simple but a harried mother needs these details ! i am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me at least as far as being a stay put dish which is why i purchased it	12
0	i love this bottle drying rack it does n't take up a lot of space and looks and workds great	12
1	it 's a waste of money you can substitute it for any piece of plastic if you have carpet if not do n't buy it	12
0	i bought these sheets online since i could n't find any in the local babies r' us store and did so with hesitation but when i received them i could n't be happier with them the best thing about these sheets besides that they fit perfectly is the velcro strips on the bottom of the sheets to insure they stay snug	12
0	we got this when our baby was about 6 months old he is now 9 months at first he was n't sure what to do but once he figured out how to jump in it it was all he wanted to do the adults all get such a kick watching him go crazy in it it 's a little awkward to move around but the enjoyment well out weighs that	12
0	i bought this w the hippo travel high chair it worked great and kept things cleaner unfortunately it was in the case w the chair when it was stolen out of our truck	12
1	i loved the gate so when i moved to my new house and found that the doorways were wider than the gate i needed the extension it was well worth it my daughter is always pulling on it and hanging on it and it still stays very sturdy within the doorway i am also happy that we got to re use the hands free gate because i would have hated to fasten a gate right onto the wall and make holes in my wall this gate was a great purchase	12
1	our daughter kept sliding out of it and the wedges would n't stay in place i love the idea but it just did n't work for us	12
0	my 3 yr old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair he does n't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair the babybjorn is a bit expensive i found a similar chair at ikea for a fraction of the cost	12
0	i got four of these sleepsacks two fleece and two cotton i found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes but it did n't effect the product they are wonderful if you are buying for a newborn get the 6 12 month size since it 'll last a bit longer i ended up giving away the 0 6 month size when my baby was only 3 months old as it was getting a bit small	12
0	this lock gives piece of mind it 's easy for adults to use and almost impossible for kids to open it 's sturdy and does n't require drilling into any cabinetry i started out with four and ordered more to have all over the house	12
0	my baby is now 5 months old and we 've been using the halo sleep sac since she started moving around more i was always worried with the regular blanket because more than a few times she would wake up crying because she had kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now i never worry that she will soffocate or that she will be cold in the middle of the night this product really gives me peace of mind and i 'll be sure to give this to any new parent friends	12
0	we bought this tub because our son struggled with the bath seats he was too big for the infant bath tubs but certainly could n't handle the full size version this tub is a perfect in between option the only thing that could make this product better is a slip resistant bottom to the tub	12
1	i wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy i will say our child is a bright out going 8 month old now but in the beginning she was colicky and a terrible napper ! i thought this was a brilliant idea but began to realize that many of the bright gifted children i know did n't have exposure to this system it is loud to wear and not so comfortable you are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening good luck if you choose to purchase but just think einstein was fine with out one	12
1	that would be one of my problems with this pump it hurt it took forever i did not have a good expereince with this pump	12
1	i bought this item despite the review that said it was too small big mistake it is small ! it 's not big enough for my 21 months old i'm very dissapointed because i liked the infant version	12
1	this product has been a disappointment the pillow portion is good in theory only the baby 's head tends to fall off the edge more times than not ! so the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right ! would n't recommend good concept bad design	12
0	i am nursing our 2 wk old and it is just easier for me if our baby sleeps with us my husband is always worried he will roll over on the baby so he does not sleep well the snuggle nest has given him peace of mind and now he can sleep also the dvd has made him more comfortable taking care of the baby by himself because he feels confident that he can calm our baby down without my help i only wish we would have bought this with second child	12
1	i am just writing to say that i loved this tub until my baby was 2 months and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere also the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out wet mommy and daddy ! so it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we 'll use it when she can sit up but i'm thinking we 'll just use the big tub when she can sit up !	12
0	this is a great item i paid 17 95 for it at walmart though ! get it there	12
1	this brand is just awful ! it 's made of cheap flimsy particle board it dents and dings very easily most inportantly the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out not only is it horribly made but it 's dangerous ! do not buy !	12
1	we love this monitor but only when it does not have awful interference unfortunately in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours we do not live in an apartment or townhouse \( which i read was not recommended for this product \) but we do have wireless internet only we are n't using it when there is static so who knows i love being able to see my boy but the static makes the monitor really annoying	12
1	it is very difficult to attach it to anything the straps are to short and under strange angel my son did not play with it	12
0	my son has now 'graduated' to the regular tub but we used this tub for a year it is perfect for when they are too big for the 'seats' and your tub does n't accomdate the rings in fact this is much better than a ring the babies sit in because there is pleanty to cusion them when they tumble over or slip trying to stand ours has withstood a year of use so far and we 'll be using it with the next baby too	12
1	it lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it now the bad ! the pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it first he takes the tray off \( also very easy for him \) and then he pulls the back off at that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing do n't plan on it lasting through more than one child	12
0	i thought these were very good quality considering the price i like them better than the one i bought at bru that cost much more	12
1	i just bought the dora folding potty seat today at walmart it does n't cover the entire toilet seat it starts at the front of the toilet and does n't go all the way to the back the result is that there is no support in the back my daughter is 3 yrs 4 months and this seat is much too weak for her any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back i'm afraid that if we use it it will soon break and she 'll fall in she definitely ca n't sit back or even sit straight up because it sinks so much i'm returning it and i'm going to look for something else	12
1	lucky for me i didn't pay for this pump but the hospital gave it to me i could only get two drops of milk for every ten pumps what a waste of time you would figure the hospital would know if the pump worked	12
0	i received this monitor as a gift and it has been a life saver how nice that i can monitor my baby 's every move and sound without being in the same room every minute ! the are two different channels so this usually cuts out the extra static or the alarm going off sometiems it 's also just a matter or re positioning the monitor to resolve the noise we were suprised one evening when we picked up what sounded like a phone conversation between two girls but switching to channel b solved that i 've used the evenflo whisper connect for about 3 months now and am quite satisfied	12
1	i bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive well i learned my lessen you get what you pay for like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw if you will closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in i changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it it still stunk ! i am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie i hope this will work out much better	12
0	this product is good for your knees however the suction does not seem to stay on well and the elbow part keeps slipping other than that it is good to hold small items like the toothbrush and toothpaste	12
0	these are perfect for my one year old who insists on feeding himself whenever we are out at a restaurant i just grab one from the diaper bag and stick it to the table who knows what they wipe those tables with \? ! this is a safer and more sanitary surface for your little ones to eat on	12
1	leaking slipping ca n't use over the kitchen sink horrible design	12
0	this is the best potty seat that you can buy it 's one piece so it easy to clean and if you have a boy it has a great splashguard also i love the handle so that you can hang it on the wall	12
1	this product is great but do not buy it from bp medical you cannot return an unopened and unused product for a full refund they charge a 15 restocking fee that is not disclosed at the time of purchase	12
0	i found this product after searching for ways to make traveling with my two year old easier she loved riding in her carseat through the airport and 6 people stopped me to ask how it worked the security agent said he wished all parents used this instead of trying to jam enormous strollers through the x ray machine	12
0	the strap on mine broke and i was very quickly sent a replacement i expressed my concerns about the size of the belt \( i have a small frame and it is big on me \) and i was told a newer design was in the works and they would send it to me once it 's done very friendly amazing customer service that 's hard to find these days !	12
0	i received this gerber gift set for my baby shower the products lather up really well and they smell great ! they are gentle and they do n't make my daughter get a rash you get a lot of product for the price too my daughter really relaxes with the lavender scent wash and lotion and we used the menthol wash when she had a cold now that my daughter is teething she drools a lot which causes chapped skin on her cheeks and chin the moisturizing stick works great for this we love this gift set and would recommend it	12
1	i went to the chp office to get my car seat checked and the officer said that auto mirrors are not approved and considered a major safety hazard during an automobile crash because they can become a projectile possibly injuring or killing your child do not buy !	12
0	i like this sheet so much better than the thin ones it offers more padding and seems so much more comfy ! it is a tight fit but i had no problem fitting the sheet onto my eddie bauer pack n play so i would assume it should fit any pack n play just make sure to wash in cold water and hang dry i never put this in the dryer the only thing i do n't like is the color it happens to match my navy blue playard but i wish it came in some lighter colors	12
0	i bought two potties before i realized that my boy had a big bottom and most other potties have really small opening and no pee guard in the front i broke down and bought this this does n't have the bells and whistles like some other potty but it 's beauty is its simplicity he is able to sit and do his business carry the urine poop container to the toilet and rinse it all by himself \( he was not even 2 yet ! \) i would highly recommed the potty training book potty training in less than a day it 's out of print but you might find an used copy on	12

0	beware ! this is not the tv series as described by the first reviewer \( not the reviewer 's fault \) this is instead the movie version of return to treasure island and the tv version is by a different distributor	16
1	the movie is a piece of art one of my all time favorites the extended edition dvd is very badly compiled the bonus features are sub par with bad video quality the alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film and do not have the bi look and feel other special features are small and without much substance the extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended it is not a director 's cut \( the dvd states this upfront in the opening credits \) so it not fun to watch do n't get this if you are looking for a lotr style extended edition	16
0	this film can be interpreted any number of ways as a farce a tragedy or just plain shakespearean comedy brenda blethyn has in the past acted in each of these genres and she brings that experience into saving grace with exquisite skill	16
0	the only reason i gave it 4 stars and not a 5 is because not everyone will be happy with all 5 films in this collection point blank is that this a must get you cannot beat the price for a good selection of quality american films very satisfied	16
0	together with 'odyssey into the minds eye' two of my favorite dvds in my collection they may be watched forever because the constant change of images and inventions cannot be retained by memory enormous visual pleasure with appropriate soothing sound track there is something healing in this flow of beautiful worlds and mind conceptions	16

0	like stuart gordon 's other venture into science fiction territory the underrated and ill fated robot jox this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience everyone joins in the fun in this one with dennis hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog debi mazar and stephen dorff providing reliable 2nd banana support and charles dance having the time of his life with his horny half metal madman this excellent dvd offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the director	16
1	the old dvd from 1997 looks better than the new hd version i 've compared the two and the first dvd had good color saturation dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette the hd version has a blue green haze covering everything and the picture is too bright they also removed the film grain and made the image look smooth and creamy the sound quality is better now though and the image of course is higher resolution	16
0	this movie showed what an amazing dancer gene kelly was this is one movie i recommened for anyone who loves the world of dance thinks gene kelly is hot \( lol \) or if you love musical theater	16
0	this set is fine as far as it goes however where are the strawberry blonde and the oklahoma kid \? warners has given other actors 6 or 7 disc sets why not cagney \? on the other hand maybe a cagney volume 2 is in the works let 's hope so	16
0	this was purchased for my daughter for her 15th birthday she is very deeply interested in shakespeare and all his works but especially romeo and juliet i saw this version when it was released originally in theaters and wanted her to have the experience of seeing these 2 actors i thought it was beautifully done then and she loves it now impressive that mom and daughter enjoy this movie when the music of today 's teens and much of their other interests are definitely not mom 's thing	16
0	my son was over 2 before we introduced be videos there are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons unlike some of the other be 's with random visuals here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust be video in bonus features it has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons and no i did n't care for the commercial either	16
1	love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one	16
1	i loved these guys as a kid this collection sucks ! ! ! do n't buy it ! the first 3 dvd 's are silent and the 5th dvd is a reunion show the grand total for shows you can actually watch is 4 take your time and search out the specific shows and characters you love and get them individually if i could get my money back i would run to the nearest post office and return this item asap ! !	16
1	i caught some of this on pbs and was beyond appalled that they chose to cast reba mcentire as nellie musicals are for people that can sing not whine and slide their way up to the preferred pitch i'm a native of arkansas by the way and it hurts my ears to listen to reba 's voice reba 's country treatment of the vocals shows exactly how talentless she is	16
1	after doing this film steve martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it but roxanne la story and bowfinger are some of steve 's best works	16
1	this complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone star movie with cringingly awful acting laughable special effects \( the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment \) appalling dubbed dialogue cheesy music inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere the grim reaper is a total disaster do n't waste your money on this turkey	16
1	this movie is a disaster there is not one single memorable performance by the cast of stars if you want to see a little boy happily running to school get hit by a car walk home injured and die have at it there is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by amazon criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it they should be is ashame	16
0	this is one of my all time favorite vampire movies the cast led by tom cruise as the vampire lestat and brad pitt as the vampire louis does an excellent job of bringing to life anne rice 's interview with the vampire the costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through and the cinematography is lush and sensual evoking the decadent lifestyle that lestat leads even kirsten dunst has a role here as a child vampire and her famous line i want some more has been rendered immortal in movie history the chemistry between lestat cruise louis pitt is believable and in fact they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie all in all a cinematic treat	16
0	the story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with mitchum in one of his nastiest roles it 's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in cape fear he meets his match in lillian gish 's character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is sweet in fact the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film charles laughton in his only stint at directing does an excellent job but i think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension a very good example of film noir	16

1	after having read the book and waiting in anticipation when it first came out i was extremely disappointed the movie very well could be alright on its own merits but the books plot is very different and much more suspenseful	16
1	i bought this dvd because i really adore the strokes good music good people good style not so good documentary whoever made this video should not make anymore at all ! the strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures 10 second clips of them the exclusive interviews were not that exclusive no sound from any of the strokes no interviews with them i can go on i mean c'mon a documentary of the strokes should at least have the strokes in it right	16
1	this does n't really do anything for me maybe if you have n't ever worked out before it may be a good beginning for you to start	16

1	the quality of the dvd 's was good however i did not like the third season as well as the first two seasons it seemed that the story was setting up for season 4	16
0	tom cruise gives an excellent performance as imf agent ethan hunt who is framed for murder after the death of his imf team together with the help of two other imf agents hunt sets out to find the real murderer cornered most of the movie and set to his limits hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants it all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker brian depalma	16
0	mathau and lemon are very funny and no wonder they continued to make other movies together like grumpy old men the plot line is straighforward but their acting and character sketch makes it truly entertaining and captures their classic relationship	16
1	the presentation of computer enhanced b w images that in some cases were sort of new added limited value to my extensive video library legacy of my father however the aural commentary of brannagh was repetitive and boring each episode basically repeated the same 6 octagenarian survivors exact same comments and reflections	16
0	pro great story teriffic acting beautiful settingcon some pacing flaws but not enough to destroy the wholelindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well cast perfunctory foil as as the story unfolds the differences between british and american style \( and culture \) are revealed providing a nice subtext to the plot one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears from the central story to the character 's lives good actors all but my best actor award goes to the photographs themselves the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once a visually rich film	16
1	this product was a bad choice for me it was a poorly done product it was washed out the quality both audio and video was terrible it was not enjoyable to watch the packaging was cheap quality i should have known better pay more and get a nice set and a better product do n't try and save a few dollars if you want something to enjoy paper sleeves make for a cheap copy	16
0	this was an excellent sophomore season for a great series	16
1	this dvd is not shaolin idiot but an older film of stephen chow it 's really a film called look out officer that stephen chow made in 1990 shaolin idiot is not out yet to my knowledge if you want stephen chow 's look out officer you should buy this dvd if not do n't	16

0	this was a subject of much conversation when i was deployed to saudi arabia and it 's still a favorite with most military and civilians in iraq ground hog day is a term used to describe the seemingly endless days that are all the same until finally the day comes when the alarm goes off and you wake up realizing it 's the day you leave the movie is high in entertainment value and the story is unusual and unique bill murray was the perfect choice to cast in the lead roll and the supporting cast all played their parts just as well it 's fun watching the lead character develop and become a new man and it almost makes me wish we had a piano here	16
1	i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen ! what bothers me the most is that the general public who has n't read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject ! i wo n't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie	16
1	i had high hopes for this movie marlon brando robert deniro and edward norton how could i go wrong with this movie with a cast like that \? despite the cast this movie sinks under a terrible script the film is often tedious and the characters never seemed very realistic to me this was a poorly contrived and at times silly film the tension never really builds even though the filmmakers try embarassing for all involved i only give it two stars to be nice to the cast	16
1	children of the corn ii terence knox is a movie that starts out well and then implodes into utter garbage the special effects are much worst then the first movie and this is like 9 years later which in itself makes it even worst the acting is so bad that one starts to liken it a parody and then one realizes that this is a serious production the gore factor has been like pushed to a rediculous level and the storyline starts out well and then implodes into utter nonesense and the dialogue is so poorly written that one wonders if they went to holly upstairs acting school to write such junk and to imagine that there are more sequells after this abomination is just beyond me	16
0	5 classic films by one of the best african american directors of all time for 20 00 ! if you think this isn't a great deal than obviously there is a problem ! mo betta blues is one of the most well put together pieces and if you enjoy the films i suggest listening to the actual soundtracks	16
0	filmed at new york 's improv in 1971 we see a young pryor working on perfecting the kind of material that made him famous more polished versions of some of these routines may be found on the 1971 album quot craps after hours quot however witness the powerful moment when he alludes to his mother 's prostitution then drops his head in sadness and takes a drag from his cigarette after realizing what he has just said this scene alone is worth the price of admission in this important look at what was to come	16

1	racer takes on a rookie wow we 've never seen that before have we \? the worst thing about this movie are the race scenes many of which resemble a video game i 'd rather watch abc sports' to live and drive the indy 500 that 's more realistic and much more fun	16
1	no a very good video poor quality hard to follow very much a cheat copy of the movie gettysburg	16
0	i love dancehall queen ! i lost my first copy \( vhs \) so i replaced it with a new copy in dvd i never get tired of watching this movie and i consider it a jamaican movie classic right up there with harder they come rockers and smile orange it is a nice twist on the traditional rags to riches story although her character 's morals are somewhat questionable \( she practically sells her daughter to a high paying local don \) you ca n't help but root for the protagonist marcia	16
0	pretty good ! my brother is a huge elmo fan and he loves the elmos world dvd`s ! this is his fourth favorete one ! he watches it almost every two days	16
0	watching this movie is a very bizarre experience having attended high school in the countryside close to large clusters of amish farms i had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing amish teenagers i dismissed most of them as rumor this movie confirmed that those wild stories i heard were probably true a very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most americans cannot even begin to comprehend worth a rental at the very least	16
1	does anyone know if there is a real pg 13 version of this film \? i 've been told it came out as a pg 13 and then was changed to an r film pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see	16

0	if you liked yul brynner in quot the magnificent seven quot you will love him in this movie brynner is cool as they come this is a great western and should be on dvd	16
0	this film is one big joke you have all the basics elements of romance \( love at first sight great passion etc \) and gangster flicks \( brutality dagerous machinations the mysterious don etc \) but it is all done with the crudest humor it 's the kind of thing you either like viserally and immediately get or you do n't that is a matter of taste and expectations i enjoyed it and it took me back to the mid80s when nicolson and turner were in their primes the acting is very good if a bit obviously tongue in cheek recommended	16
1	this is the worst ripoff of a major literary work i have ever seen it takes colossal gall \( to say nothing of immense bad taste \) to take the bare bones of a dostoevsky novella tack on every possible bodice ripper cliche in movies then try to interweave dostoevsky 's own personal travails as narrative interstices all done with no flair for nor flavor of the original the acting is strictly mid 20th century nyah ha ha masterpiece theater while the casting is about as suitable as ray winstone in his infamous henry viii turn i got this just to see the great luise rainer now i will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed	16
0	this is without a doubt one of harrison fords greatest moments an incredible film with some of the best visual effects i 've ever seen very dramatic with a lot of suspense a very well written plot and an all star cast make this a very enjoyable experience to view a film you will want to see again and again action mystery drama thriller there are a lot of goofs in this film if you are into looking for such but they do n't in any way detract from the overal quality of this very well done suspense drama i highly recommend it	16
0	this is the only movie that i really like made by woody allen but is one of the funniest movies i have ever seen	16
1	what a horrendous experiment in comedy if you like jerry lewis i guess you 'll love this travesty of a film if you are a film snob you will love it personally as neither i am grossly disappointed and just really did n't get quot the joke quot it was trite and dull there was no point the plot technology encroaching on humanity well good try but again not for me if i am looking for a laugh i will watch a good coen brothers film	16

1	another tired story about the blackman as the horrible villian and the blackwoman as the innocent victim and we wonder why our community has so many problems maybe it 's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films color purple for colored girls etc we need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we work together that means blackmen and blackwomen	16
1	amazon should send all of these 25th anniversary dvd 's back to uni the faulty product locks up after about 1 1 2 hours on both my panasonic and sony dvd decks ! i see this problem also exists in the wide screen version from the reviews of that product simply put don't buy this lousy universal product ! ! !	16

1	she sings and acts like a airhead he acts like the sams sort of idiots who fight in the professional wrestkers league from the moment these two were married in 2002 the press and the talk shows were all over them like vultures flying over a carcass so the silly fools did this stupid reality show for mtv destroying whatever change they might have had in a life together and filmed every aspect of their lives in front of a camera now today big surprise simpson and lachly are getting divorsed the silly fools asked for it and in the end it led to heart break	16

1	the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor but there 's no mystery	16
0	thank heaven for larry david and curb your enthusiam or there would be nothing brilliantly entertaining and provocative to watch that was n't political except south park reno 911 which are really in a different league altogether	16

0	i read over some of the other people 's opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it my kids ages 6 2 loved this movie from start to finish the music the characters and the story were great for the entire family i definitely recommend this movie for your family 's movie collection	16
1	this entire movie could have run in only 20 minutes and you would n't miss anything and might even enjoy it unfortunately it ran 88 minutes too long and i could n't wait for it to end i saw it in the theater and the people all around me were all complaining how boring it was at least a quarter of them walked out before the end it 's that bad it 's a shame i love a good suspense horror movie and the decent actors in this movies were waisted	16
1	for those of you looking for more eva action after seeing the original series take heed don't buy this dvd ! the death part of the dvd part 1 is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season and the second half rebirth part 2 is new stuff very good but ! if you buy 'the end of evangelion' you get rebirth and a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material so do n't buy 'death rebirth' buy 'the end of evangelion' instead	16
1	this joe d'amato film takes the women in prison genre one step deeper into the abyss of sleaze bordering on pornography the plot or lack thereof is typical woman goes into jail undercover to unearth the guards corruption to make the film last 80 minutes joe d'amato fills the story with lesbianism vile tortures naked women in rat infested sewers and plenty of gratuitous sex i gave this movie 1 star because there is no option for a 0 star rating even hardcore fans of euro sex queen laura gemser will find this one a total bore	16
0	maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with chekov 's work and therefore have no preconceived notions but i found this british made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre revolution russia the story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy sentimental or even tragic	16
0	this is definately worth the price i cried and laughed watching the perfect story of chi and hedeki beautiful animation great story line	16
1	i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets however i have to say this video was not what i expected there were some great vintage clips but not enough muppets monsters for me this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing i would recommend you pass on this one and get 123 count with me instead	16
1	this was not the entire version of the hbo special i was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this dvd if i had known it was n't the entire show i would n't have bought it	16
0	this jet li movie is thus far the best movie since shaolin temple as younger jet li its awesome surreal fighting creates this epic feel to the whole genre of martial arts fighting jet li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie it has laughter suspense compassion and innocense the most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the witches pawn this film is highly recommended to those who love jet li and crouching tiger hidden dragon an excellent movie to add to the jet li collection	16
0	this dvd 'd ok it has the original program in it and some new features although i was a bit dissapointed as the new features only included about 10 mins of extra buzzer beaters and the t mac ending goes for like 5 mins and the quality isnt that great	16
1	this was our first bob dvd and maybe i just chose wrong my son waited for the theme song the whole time and it never played maybe that is the norm this whole thing is kinda strange my son likes it but does n't love it i simply should have researched more	16

1	i purchased this dvd and i was shocked to see the terrible violence and gore especially on innocent animals i wouldn't recommend this dvd to the faint of heart especially to persons under 18 this was certainly a bad choice of purchase on my part	16
1	i was eager to see this movie having loved the original american werewolf movie but was sadly disappointed i did n't care at all for the characters the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen mark me off if you do n't agree i know you rude lot will anyway but that 's my story and i'm sticking to it	16
1	the review on the cover of the dvd reads a snappy sexy thriller i must disagree this was the most unsexy and unthrilling movie i 've seen in a long time in my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll it 's almost comedic twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had i have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production the film 's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination my vote \? just okay nothing to write home about	16
0	set two is really season three \( set five is season one \? \? \) and all the murders are excellent !	16
0	this movie is great i just bought it the other day and rushed home to watch it i throughly enjoyed it entirely i believe it kind of relates to fatal attraction	16
1	great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost did n't finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira 's voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie	16
0	the perpetrators of a high level corporate scandal \( masayuki mori takashi shimura ko nishimura \) are pursued by the illegitamate son \( toshiro mifune \) of a low level functionary that they drove to suicide to protect their schemes this film begins as a deeply satisfying revenge epic but the masterful director akira kurosawa is not content to let it rest there he draws out all the moral complexities of the situation then hits us with an unexpected development at the end that gives an ironic twist to his title the bad may not always go to prison for their crimes but do they really sleep well \?	16
0	wow ! what more can i say ! just watching this was an absolutely extraordinary experience this is a behind the scenes look at photography it gets you up close and personal with the photographers and lets you know what is involved in trying to capture the shot of a lifetime i own many national geographic books but you wo n't be able to appreciate what goes into each photograph without watching this dvd even those who are not interested in photography will be able to appreciate it	16

1	most people ca n't get enough of this movie i even own it on laserdisc when i saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on dvd i had to have it i am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality it lookslike there was just a transfer from vhs to dvd there does n't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality i recently saw it on hdnet movies and thought it looked much better do buy this movie because it is an all time classic do n't buy this movie if you think that the 20th anniversary edition is going to get you anything better	16

0	this original version is much funnier than u s version the humor is dry and intelligent and the characters are very complex at times you feel sorry for them other times you love them and laugh with them and mostly you think they 're idiots what a talented group of actors and comedians to create such a complexity of emotion in an audience it 's not often i can watch a dvd or series over and over but this is one that i 've enjoyed each time	16
0	like the mtm show newhart has a style of humor that 's timeless and this show seemed to get better with each passing season	16
0	i really like this dvd you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises and she moves quickly from one exercise to another i like the variety of exercises there are not too many rep 's on any one exercise which keeps the workout from being monotonous this is the first programmable exercise dvd i 've used and i like being able to pick and choose which exercise segments to do and in which order this makes it easier for me to get motivated to start \( and once i start i'm fine \)	16
1	midway was the decisive naval engagement of the second world war decided by a handful of bombs hitting the japanese carriers over a period of a few minutes it is a riveting story that has been well told in several movies and innumerable books not here relying upon outtakes from tora tora tora \( and the wonderful japanese cast of that film \) what we have here is a pedestrian outing that should be avoided at all costs quite honestly \? the best version of the battle of midway was steven spielberg 's original star wars \( before it had roman numberals	16
1	overall i have always enjoyed robin william and billy crystal 's performance in many other movies but i must admit to my surprise that it was n't making me laughing on the floor as i usually do the script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing did n't like the ending it was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it 's normal for mothers to lie i hope someday to see both robin and billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	16
1	this dvd was a waste of money and a waste of time it 's unauthorized by muse so therefore there were no interviews no live footage and none of their music was included they interviewed people who had never even met the band i learned nothing new from watching it do n't waste your money	16
1	i loved what the bleep \? and i specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day' this video teaches nothing about how to create your day nothing it 's just ramtha \( jz knight \) talking about the fact that you can create your day i heard you in the movie ! i bought this to give me some additional insights into how to create my day it does not teach any how whatsoever do not buy this video ! buy the secret thesecret tv buy the attractor factor by joe vitale buy wealth beyond reason by bob doyle do not buy this video	16
1	great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost did n't finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira 's voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie	16
0	i really really like this piece of film rated pg 13 for stylized action violence good for anyon	16
0	this movie was one of the most honest accurate portrayals of how to play the dating game i have ever seen i liked it so much i bought it for my 15 year old son to give him pointers ignore the tacked on hollywood ending	16
0	after being into the techno scene since my first party in 1993 this is one of the best videos i have seen describing the dj feelings you really get a feel for how a dj thinks if you at all interested in the dj lifestyle or are interested in djing this is a must have it have great insights in the minds of some of the best djs around plus nigel richards does a great job with the how to dj part not only is this for the newbies but for those who have been around a bit plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms wow that sounded like an infomercial	16
1	this dvd is very cheesy and i am sorry i bought it	16
1	note that in my previous review in which i commented on the dreadful dvd transfer i was only referring to the quot that touch of mink quot dvd the father goose dvd is not that bad	16
1	what was john singleton thinking i know he produces good films but this is far worse the shaft from the 70s was sexier cooler more aggressive and classer than jackson this was a watered down verison where parks and roundtree made cameos it 's almost to the point they take the blackness out of the character no love making and ect do n't even waist your time ! if you want to see it check it out on cable tv or something save your money	16
0	i first saw this movie when i was a kid it left a good impression i am now nearly 50 and a cat came to live with me my first female cat i named it mewsette in honor of judy garland 's character in the movie i then searched for the movie on the internet found it bought it while it 's not as good as it was when i was a kid it is still amusing	16
1	i totally agree with soda fizz because im 18 now and i grew up watching these old shows like doug angry beavers are u afraid of the dark rocco pete and pete all that etc they sould put those shows on in rotation and put them out on dvd im sure there are tons of people out there who would buy them \( me being one of them \) bring back the old shows	16
1	the only thing that kept this from being absolutely predictable was that a dead bad guy did not spring back to life i found myself saying oh come on to one plot point after another \( previous reviewers have covered these absurdities \) the underlying scenario was unconvincing and un involving \( previous reviews in this thread provide details \)	16
1	i'm sorry but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film dick dick is funny this is not i'm sorry but dustin hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like kirsten dunst \( or that level of indefatigable cuteness \) just go rent dick instead you 'll thank me yourself and those fine ladies who saved our country	16
0	moving intelligent realistic not overly acted \( as could quite easily have been the case \) about a 20 year old who has gone off the rails to come back onto them again you see why this has happened feel sympathy and just want him to do well when the film ends a story about hope in a world with little	16
1	this is a terrible movie when it came out in 1956 it was a box office bomb even though both stars were at the height of their powers time had only added to it 's mediocrity	16
1	this movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes yes it is slightly interesting to see the cannes environment but not enough to watch this film it could be a cure for insomnia though fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed you can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen and it 's really just very boring all those fans of johnny depp be particularly warned he may have co star billing but blink and you 'll miss him	16

0	i am a huge muppet fan and was very excited to have the opportunity to get a newer remastered version of this classic while the quality is not too much better than the original dvd release it is definitely worth adding to your collection especially if you do n't have any version of the movie yet !	16
0	was surprised by the price compared to other movies but it was worth it	16
0	i really enjoyed this dvd and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns the instructor actually starts with the left foot so you can follow her mirror image i teach dance and will definately use a lot of these moves and you will work up a sweat if you want more just do jumping jacks or run when they march enjoy	16
1	i have never understood why people find this to be the pinnacle of british comedy once you get past the numerous jokes about mrs slocum 's cat and a flaming mr humphreys you have very little left to justify it 's long run except that it was probably the right show in the right place at the right time in retrospect it is lacking many will disagree with me but that 's life	16
0	shel natowsky ph d this movie is costner 's best without any hesitation the performances by hackman and sean young are also flawless supporting roles are well honed as well the movie has everything you could want in a film i mean everything ! the screenplay is wonderfully written acted directed and presented why is it that movies as superb as this one is cannot be made anymore \? everytime i run it it never ceases to thrill me and to amaze me if you want to see a cold war drama that never ceases to excite and one which moves at a fever 's pace then see this one satisfaction guaranteed ! well done people	16

0	this movie helps brings to life what you have read in the bible about john and future world events you must see this movie	16
0	while this dvd was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times the genius of david bowie shines through as adults too young to remember or have seen ziggy stardust it was an amazing look at the time period the sound quality is suprisingly good although some camera angles are distracting at times it was also neat to hear bowie 's pronouncement of this is our last tour ever little did he know this dvd is worth every penny rock on	16
1	the movie has a great story unlike streetfighter alpha the movie alpha generations actually follows the correct storyline it had the potential to be a great movie but there is to much wrong with it that cannot be overlooked that will irritate you immediately the character design sucks \( why dose n't ryu look like ryu \? \) the english voice acting sucks \( i recommend watching it in japanese with subtitles \) and the fights suck the only fight worth watching during the whole movie is ryu vs sakura this film dose n't even deserve a 1 star rating i just gave it that because there 's no way to go lower	16
0	my 11 year old saw this movie at school and would n't stop talking about it or asking for it since we could n't find it at any store we amazoned it and there it was ! ! part of his christmas present he loves it this movie is very inspiring and from what he says it makes him have hope in other people and what we can do to help others	16
0	i'm very very picky about my action movies and this one is worth the trouble story line shmory line this is an action movie i watch my action movies for action not a lesson in philosophy and religion kind of a heartbreaking movie though because he 's dead no matter what the man ca n't sleep or he slips in a coma going out with a bang with a freefall from a helicopter telling his woman how much he loved her that 's a film you wo n't regret owning this i promise you p s it is very possible that the negative reviewers are crackbabies that is all	16
1	i saw this at a friends house so thank god i did n't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy i can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film ! the guys are not hot not even lukewarm for that matter the acting is terrible please anyone who had anything to do with this do n't continue in the film industry if it was possible to assign negative stars i would do so for this awful experience run away	16

1	with the all star lineup this movie had i would 've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the gov of lousiana this could have been a really good gangster flick all the people were avaialable sean penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something i really could not follow could have put his skills onto something better this movie is a complete waste of talent money you name it	16
0	ok this definately looks very promising i saw a version of this on the flix channel about three nights ago it was good if that is any indication on how good the show is then this collector 's edition box set of the older series should be better i am going to purchase this soon once i purchase it i will let you know how good it really is i 'll give another review once i purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes a month ago is when i really learned of this series so i am truly looking forward to watching this series goddess anjanee	16
0	i was fourteen years old when i attended the new york premier of this movie at the rivoli theater i have the original premier book from the theater which is not for sale i immediately fell in love with the beautiful ingrid bergman so did millions of other young men this movie did not win the award of the year it was overshadowed by casablanca which in my estimation was of inferior quality compared to for whom the bell tolls bob richard	16

0	with king creole love me tender and stay away joe jailhouse rock 1957 is elvis presley at his best he declined the old musical tradition of mgm and insisted on a contemparary look especially how the choreography should be executed in this film we see elvis presley at his very best he was a stunning actor much more prefer him to james dean it`s a shame he made more or less 33 forgettable films only a handful stands out and jailhouse rock is the best it isn`t a classic it isn`t even great but we have elvis the king and that`s the best there is \) \)	16
1	colorado 's san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is myfavorite place to vacation in the usa so when i saw the preview ofdurango kids on another dvd i decided to rent it on netflix it isone of those movies where villains are cartoonish and the kids whilecute outsmart all the stupid adults the first 30 minutes showed somenice locations in and around durango including the steam train \( that 'swhy i purchased a used copy \) but then it goes into time travel to saveouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore intended for young and undemanding children do n't bother unless youlove durango as much as i do	16
0	i thought that this was adam sandler 's best movie he has made that he played man who 's a slacker that he trys to impress his girlfriend by adopting a cute 5 year old boy \( played by dylan cole sprouse \) i think of how the movie should 've ended real good is for sonny to have legal custody of jullian i laugh out loud when i see this movie ! ! !	16
0	this movie is definitely one of the better thrillers to come out since it 's release it 's action packed and full of tension in it 's 90 minutes of right on time kurt russell always good does a great job and this is no exception the late great j t walsh in one of his last performances plays one of the best bad guys i ca n't recommend this film enough for those seeking thrills action and suspense i ca n't really say what is wrong with the film but i just felt that it did n't belong in the perfect category although maybe it should because it does answer on every call a movie to watch again and again	16
1	but the movie was just plain stupid do n't waste your time	16
0	this is a must own film ! i enjoyed this movie from beginning to end daniel berhardt is god	16
1	jackie is only in a brief clip in the beginning stolen from the real drunken master this clip is entirely unrelated to the movie and is very short buy this if you want but not because you think it has jackie in it	16
1	i would love to review this lions gate dvd but i ca n't catch one word in ten it is not as advertised closed captioned and the characters' speech is too casual and british for me to get drat ! i was so chuffed to see there was a cc version	16
1	remember seagal 's movie patriot where he saves the day with flower petals dropped from a plane that was bad this one was by far the worst movie he has ever made with the dubbed in voice \( why \? \) to the disjointed plot it should never have been released	16
0	the sound quality and the quality of musicians is insanely good i bought this primarily to see jaco the biggest distraction was the bits of james dean and doo wap music videos from the 50 's added in i wish this was remastered with just the concert performances also it appears to me that the jaco bass solo was cut i still give it 5 stars regardless	16
0	it 's not a great movie but it 's a lot of fun this is one of those movies that just catches me it 's quirky and has some decent \( for it 's day \) effects there are a feww laugh out loud momments truth be told they are few and far between some great bit characters make up a fun ensemble the cast is pretty damn cool with urich being upstaged by ron pearlman angellica houston john mat mattus the big guy anyway it 's cornball comedy with a basic plot hey what do you want \? it 's 80 's chessy goodness and more fun that it should have been i still giggle at the time warp battle	16
1	just rented this dvd and was quite surprised normally i'm a big george clooney and matt damon fan however in this film their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script editing and direction which made this film quite dull to watch while the idea behind the movie is good it could have been more entertaing dramatic or suspensful as another reviewer remarked i was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else but i did suffer through to the end where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging	16
1	i agree with the negative comments i eventually stopped watching it unconvincing acting \( and a small point that i found irritating in tv movies about war some of them have a too clean look that make a film seem unrealistic there is no dirt anywhere as far as i could see everybody looks too clean the settings look too clean and not realistic the acting level was what finally turned me off glad it was on tv	16

1	i did n't watch millenium when it was on ten years ago so i thought i 'd give it a try on dvd as i'm a big x files fan i watched two shows the beginning and the end and the dogs they were ridiculous and boring i'm done with millenium	16
1	i'm a huge orson welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge but i hated this film i was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that i just did n't get it the photography was classic welles the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum do n't get caught up in having to like it just because it 's welles it 's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world this movie blows	16

1	yes wild things is what i recommend for our jaded eyes are n't we sick of all the crowd pleasing pg 13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed most of all with hardly a plot \? wild things is sex sex sex but with witty capital h humor and a twisted story recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast \( from oscar nominee matt dillon kevin bacon etc \) can turn candy into cuisine	16
1	really not worth the effort to find it even if george macdonald fraser was involved with the screenplay the producers chose the least best of the flashman novels to adapt they cast the wrong actor to play the role and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy not very funny slapstick comedy do n't bother searching for it true flashman fans will be disappointed	16
1	the basic pilates mat exercises are performed which are okay however the cardio segment of this video is truly lame ! the instructor runs the viewer through marching marching and stretching one 's arm at the same time and finally marching and kicking back one 's leg that 's it how incredibly dull ! what 's worse the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration pilates for dummies is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates \( do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio \) i would n't waste your time w this video	16
0	this is a beautifully orchestrated tale about the delightful absurdity in all human endeavor it is also a story of cross cultural misunderstanding of the highest order kinsky was a madman in the film and in real life and therefore perfect for the part the scene of the steam ship spinning out of control in that waterfall is one of the memorable in the history of the cinema the cinematography and editing are a masterpiece unforgettable	16

0	i bought this dvd because i was getting sick of the other dvd 's that claim to be pilates workouts this pilates work out is very imformative and very beneficial i am actually seeing results from this workout after only 3 weeks karen also keeps you motivated to continue not to mention the benefit of getting two 50 minute workouts for the price of one beware that you need a resist a ring for one of the workouts though and those can be difficult to find great great workout and i would recommend it to anyone	16

0	my sister and i loved this show growing up \( the huxtables reminded us of our extended family ! \) the episode where stevie wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best episodes \( in my opinion \) i do question why in amazon 's list of actors at the top of the page \( for the season 2 set \) joseph c philips is the only one listed although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later regardless this is a great collection and a must for cosby fans	16

1	an exact copy of ang lee 's wonderful quot eat drink man woman quot frankly what annoyed me here was i watched this one first i just finished watching eat drink it took me about 15 minutes to realize i was watching an exact copy of something i 'd already seen a couple years ago anyway i was annoyed because while i could predict events in eat drink because i 'd seen tortilla soup eat drink was clearly the better movie so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of eat drink for me if you have n't seen either see the better of the two \( exact same stories \) eat drink man woman	16
0	i normally do not enjoy movies about the making of movies so i was very pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained by 'living in oblivion' the reason i took the chance at all was due to the presence of catherine keener one of our most overlooked and under appreciated hollywood actresses she once again did not disappoint but the entire cast was extremely good you get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director the amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason i'm glad to join my fellow amazonians in heaping praise on this low budget gem	16

1	do n't know about anyone else but the dvd i purchased had lousy video the only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots all of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either i know the concert was indoors but i 've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem did i get a bad dvd or did anyone else have this problem	16
1	i'm not a fan of stephen king film adaptations the only one i like is carrie bec it was directed by brian depalma and featured terrific performances by sissy spacek and piper laurie cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful i could n't wait for it to end not worth purchasing okay as a rental	16

1	appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget cgi enhanced anime theatrical releases have gorgeous visuals but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog trust me i was sucked in by the amazing trailer like most of you i wanted this to be a great movie \( as i am a fan of the oav animated series \) appleseed is worth seeing for the visuals alone but that is about all	16
0	i bought this for my 3yr old twins and from the first showing i kept hearing giggling and laughing as they watched the cartoons my girls already are familiar with some fairy tales so they really loved the three little pigs and the pied piper i highly recommend this dvd and think it is a great buy for parents with young children	16
1	the movie is a about a guy who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that that 's pretty much the whole story well the idea is quite powerful but not new the characters are done in the comics style and very primitive the jokes are quite boring actually what is really amazing that it could 've been ok to watch as a family movie but a few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids too boring for adults not appropriate for kids too much moral for young crowd i ca n't really think who might like it	16
0	maggie gyllenhaal played her part to perfection scarily so she 's the perfect sociopath only thinking of herself while using her daughter as well as anyone else she encounters as a foil she 's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path all in all a real slice of life film accurately depicted directed and played	16
0	a b w film classic excellent story and performances from all the stars perhaps the acting style is a little dated a very god qulaity transfer to dvd except for one scene that is a little grainy i will watch this film again and again	16
1	the fake news tv movie had already be done and done better ten years ealier as special bulletin where the first movie took its subject nuclear disarmament and terrorism seriously this cheese fest does n't respect the viewers' intelligence at all they pull every heartstring and throw every cheap trick they can think of at the camera not of it ties together in any coherent way and the make love not war ending reeks of junior high school sophistry	16
0	this disc is pure gold ! featuring a full live performance from their 2004 european tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate stray cats fan collectible ! the concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80 's they show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show they go through all their classics and then some whether it 's stray cat strut gene and eddie or rumble in brighton what you see and hear on this disc is flawless must buy for all music fans not just fans of the cats	16
1	i really did give this a chance but i ca n't say i like the show it focuses more on the police aspect and less on the science which differentiates the csi series from most of the other garbage out there i know david caruso has his fans but i just ca n't appreciate him in this vehicle	16
1	we got jason in space and we get pinhead in space this is pure nonsense words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people it 's time to stop making these movies !	16
0	this movie has a lot of meaning behind it the actors put on a really good show movie is lacking special effects but that does not hurt the quality in any way story keeps on unfolding in unexpected ways	16
1	i saw tarzan the ape man on hbo or cinemax when i was a teenager and it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it was stupid and had no plot	16
1	i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it it go 's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right there are better ones out there than this but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it	16
0	this series is exactly what the english love about mystery and crime it 's a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like the shield that being said this series is well done and does capture you over time rather than individual crime stories this series contains only one crime investigation if you like drama and cop stories this is a good one	16
1	starring sam from whose the boss and that guy that used to be married to christina applegate i really hate this movie it 's so boring and not exciting like drew barrrymores version	16
0	i heard so much about masaki kobayashi 's harakiri so i bought it at amazon and watched it wow this movie is awesome ! ! now i do n't know who is my 1 favorite director akira kurosawa or masaki kobayashi this black and white movie intensifies the theme of this movie along with the music by tohru takemitsu in addition to these assets the camera is wonderful i pick this movie as one of my movies of my life tatuyua nakadai was shining in this movie i like him more after seeing harakiri	16
1	this has already been expressed here in the reviews but just as a reminder one more time this dvd is not the original version the original version has more material and is much better hopefully someday they 'll release an unrated version the way it was on vhs at one time	16
1	this scooby doo vhs is absoulty horrible ! ! it lacks exciting adventures and silly antics of the scooby doo team too drawn out and serous not anough scary monsters or surprises too much boring details not anough silly actions that kids like plus its higher cost i paid 9 95 trust me buy scooby doo 2 or scooby doo cyber chase those keep the kids glued to the t v very exciting just the way we want scooby doo to be ! !	16
0	i liked very much these series you will enjoy every momets in this moives it is deserve a place in my collection	16
1	i still have not received this dvd it was ordered on 12 8 06 and was supposed to ship on 12 12 06 i am very upset that it did not arrive as it was a christmas gift i cannot rate the product as i do n't have it i sent an e mail through amazon to jrmovies several days ago and have not heard from them i would appreciate a response or a refund	16
0	i 'll make this short and sweet this is by far the best bond movie of them all imho excellent work by connery and the rest of the cast	16
0	this was a great dvd i bought it for my husband and he loved it there were a few episodes that we never saw and the outakes were really funny i definately would recomend	16
0	i did not have any of the original trilogy on dvd i am happy to have the theatrical releases as i am not a fan of the se 's particularly jedi i was nervous due to bad reviews but they look and sound great if you like star wars and want the original releases i highly recommend these if you already happily own the se 's or are feeling cheated or robbed in some way by repeated releases of the same movie then do n't buy these	16
0	great improvements over the original dvd enhanced for 16x9 tvs with scenes that are now clearer and actually 2 35 1 widescreen ratio the original dvd claims an aspect ratio of approximately 2 35 1 which was not true i own both versions and have compared viewing aspects of each clearly this dvd is far superior and well worth the purchase price this plays very well on my hdtv monitor i 'll give the old version to someone w an old 4x3 tv	16
0	we enjoyed this video the rugby athletes are fun to watch in such a surreal setting somehow these tough big athletes being posed and shot in various homoerotic poses gives new meaning to sporn	16
0	if your a fan of progressive rock you probably already know how good this cd is in my mind it is the single greatest cd of all time \( followed closely by operation mindcrime any of the great pink floyd and rush records \) my only complaint on this dvd is the sound i was at this show and the sound at the theater was great somewhere it did n't transfer to the recording it is not the worst thing i have ever heard but it does n't show the bands power live every other aspect of this dvd is well worth the price i would not want to be with out it	16
0	this movie is great ! very subtle humor but if you watch it you will be laughing out loud love it	16
0	i have not gotten into watching the dvd as of yet because i am still watching the reruns on tv but i know i have no qualms with the dvd i have bought all the series thus far it is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan	16
0	really does not get the film noir credit it deserves \( probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring dinah shore or other 1940 's musical starlet \) some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale gene tierney is wonderfully mercurial sometimes hot hot hot and other times just plain icy cold this was her only oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here see gene in this and in laura and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances	16
1	hands down the worst episode of the masters of horror television show it 's dull boring and not scary it will leave you scratching your head saying that 's all \? do n't even bother with this dvd it 's a waste of your precious time	16
1	this is the worst transfer to dvd i 've ever seen ! ! ! i think the vhs copy looks and sounds better do not waste your money ! !	16
1	more time could have been spent in ney york city for this movie like with friday the 13th part seven the new blood all of the good gore scenes were cut out but still this is a terrible movie and i am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five	16
1	i love jeff goldblum but he did n't carry this film the film was ruined for me the second julane moore \( yuck ! \) and the ridiculous lame token black daughter of goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film it 's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter what a concept it just added to the disbelief of the characters \( stay goldblum \) the storyline and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel jurassic park iii was n't much better	16
0	this movie is truly wonderfully done i appreciate the lightheartedness of the characters and the deep resonances of director zhang yimou 's commentary on academics in modern rural china the language is particularly good for students learning mandarin chinese as it shows an excellent example of the differences between spoken chinese in the countryside and in the cities there are english subtitles for beginners as well i highly recommend it	16
1	i have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the kids channels i was hoping the dvd would show each of his songs as they are performed on tv instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons this would have been a better cd instead of a dv	16
0	i loved this movie it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it this did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a tv show that was made into a movie	16
1	i bought this dvd on the basis that shania twain performed the half time show even when i did a search for shania twain this dvd was listed incorrectly as there is no shania performance on the dvd as far as the football goes i really can not comment as i am from the uk and know nothing about american footbal sorry ! !	16
0	i echo most of the previous reviews this hayley mills vehicle has little to do with the excellent mary stewart novel that it shares some of its title with hayley was too young to be the novel 's heroine and so for this film the plot and romance were 'youthened' sanitized \( though the novel 's romance was also chaste \) and also very much dumbed down as a featherweight hayley mills film this is harmless and very much a lesser disney film of the 60s just do n't expect this to be more than it is and you might enjoy it even with your kids of today as a retro laugh	16
1	but the movie was just plain stupid do n't waste your time	16
1	i would have liked a more real story in this dvd	16
0	i love this show it is well written superbly cast and always fun to watch i highly recommend !	16
0	this is a good cartoon for competition with rocket robin hood hope they come to quick agreable turms msp didnt see the black wolf or fox \? \?	16
1	imagine someone combining the scripts for zardoz and independence day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing then you would have battlefield earth it is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars you become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of john travolta putting his heart and soul into a project just awful if battlefield earth and pluto nash were humans they would deserve to be executed	16
0	1 of 8 people found the following review helpful i loved this movie ! june 4 2006aladdin is total family entertainment the music is awesome and clever great voices wonderful to watch other classics not to forget about are mary poppinsmy fair ladythe wizard of ozchitty chitty bang bandthe first charlie and the chocolate factorythe sound of musicoliverwest side storyfiddler on the roofsinging in the rainthe wizlittle mermaidaladdinbeauty and the beastgreasethe king and ioklahomathe music mansouth pacificmy voice students are always asking me for recommendations so i though i 'd post it for all ! we ca n't forget about these great musicals	16
0	the concert in central park is not only the best of simon garfunkel 's concerts it is one of the best of anyone 's concerts in my estimation the crowd was really in to it and simon and garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music and the era it was written in i have owned the vcr tape for years and enjoyed it many times but the signal was beginning to fade so i was very pleased to see it released on dv	16
1	this movie made no sense to me whatsoever it was n't really funny and it was n't scary the only thing that i got was that he killed zombies or returners as he called theme and was upssed with one i have to admit the female lead in the film was hot but that was the only good thing in the film it was also boring but if you are into forgin fright films this is the movie for you	16
0	this movie is pure fun my whole family loved it it 's corny and the acting leaves you feeling like it 's amatuer hour but its fun to watch we made popcorn and laughed our way through the whole thing watch it and enjoy	16
0	i love the simpsons ! although the early seasons are classic they seem to get better and more funny as they go on this season includes the episode where milhouse 's parents get divorced which is hilarious and the one where homer eats those hot chili peppers and freaks out ! definitely worth the purchase there are a lot of extras too	16
0	the first wayne 's world provides all the necessary background but number 2 is actually better because it has a longer list of interesting cameo appearances including starkly realistic versions of jim morrison and sammy davis jr spoofing the oliver stone film jfk in the desert	16
0	i loved this movie it was very touching and projected a wonderful image it was a rare find	16
1	not a good script kind of slow a regular movie if you are into history in america but if you dont live there or got any interest in this particular plot i wont recomended is borin	16
1	jack nicholson in this shameless attempt at comedy plays a dog trainer of all professions who gets involved with an oprea singer who is caught up in the underworld of crime critcally embarssing to nicohlson 's carrer but jack has done much better to cover this mistake a minor film with good talent gone to waste a film way below par considering the re teaming of director bob rafelson amp nicholson from quot five easy pieces quot	16
1	this film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times it is not comparable to other great westerns made during the sixties eli wallach is good but confusing who and what is he after \? the color is good and it sounds like a sergo leone picure but it is n't what a shame ! ! ! it could have been made better less comedy and more plot and of course action and suspense ! ! ! ! buy or rent on your own if you dare i would n't	16
1	some scenes are repeated from the first it is not that bad thats all i can say i think i over rated it with 2 stars too many	16
0	i found this movie delightful from the storyline directing and photography to the actors ! i especially loved the performances of timothy bottoms and chloris leachman ! it 's an enlightening movie that makes an important point sometimes what we think we want is not really what we want at all	16
1	four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction loaded with drugs with paul mccartney in charge what do you get \? magical mystery tour with no plot great music this plays as a too long music video without purpose ok if you 're a beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967 but if you were n't a beatles fan then there is no reason for this at least a hard days' night with richard lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers but this \? too many drugs and too much ego and no direction that 's all	16
0	its amazing how strongly images and music can impact the senses without any spoken word this is a great film to throw on relax and absorb	16
1	this is probably the worst war related movie i 've ever seen i am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two time spent watching this film is time you 'll never get back and have nothing to show for it	16
1	the crappiest dvd release ever ! video and audio quality sucks ! this is not a jet li movie buyer 's beware ! i 'll give this a negative rating	16
0	my little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie he goes around acting like the characters from the movie ! he really likes harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending he is also convinced that they should make a midnight madness 2 and let harold win the next time ! this is a great movie with a young michael j fox in it and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie	16
1	the so called humor in this embarrassingly awful and unfunny movie is so uncreative and moronic it is apparently for a demographic of viewers with an extremely childish sense of humor a three year old will laugh at anything every turn of the plot is stupid this is in the running for the worst movie ever made i do n't trust the taste of anyone who actually was impressed by this horse manure i hope that bruce willis would have the class to turn down a role like this if he was offered it now i think he is a very good actor it 's a shame what kind of garbage he had to be in to get his career going	16
1	these plays were okay i'm glad i rented them before buying them the props and things were very nice the actors did n't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre \( definitely no tyler perry quality on that note \) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out i thought alexander o'neal sang in one of them but he did n't	16
1	i 've been wanting to see this movie and i finally did on logo i'm just happy i waited untill it came on tv i though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it the romance was slim to none i thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role well i wo n't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it anyway i would much rather watch beautiful thing get real all over the guy the incredibly true adventure of two girls in love	16
1	i watched this with my parents and did n't like marlons mouth reading these reviews you would think he is a hero or something he cusses at everything and takes his whole urban hip hop gansta attitude too far what is cool about that \? that whole lifestyle that everyone thinks is so cool is ruining my school and my neighborhood the rest of the movie was all right but marlon made me feel funny with his use of profanity sorry that 's just my opinion	16
0	this film is a must see for any dancer the clips used to showcase different types of dancing in film are creatively woven together and the commentary is very informative many famous scenes from the old mgm musicals to the water spray scene in flashdance are used to illustrate how diversified dancing in films can be for ballet dancers there is a portion devoted solely to ballet in films which is hosted by mikhail baryshnikov scenes of rudolph nureyev leaping through the air compliment this section as well as scenes from various ballets liza minelli hosts the broadway inspirational portion which is shorter in length i only saw this film once but i feel that it is a must own selection for any dancer	16
1	everyone who has rated this film over 1 star is involved in the making of this crappy movie click on the link to see their other reviews where are they \? ! ! this movie is absolutely terrible if you can handle more than ten minutes of it you 're a tougher man than m	16
0	all the danger man dvds are excellent the shows are extremely thought provoking and are much more enjoyable if viewed giving time for some entertaining analysis that almost always occurs when i put these on any fan of mcgoohan british tv or tv with some intellectual bite to it will enjoy this series	16
1	this mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny considering the comedic caliber of its two stars billy crystal and robin williams i was expecting a laugh riot but that 's not what this is it 's not their fault it 's the scriptwriter 's i guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper but that humor just did n't translate to the screen despite the best efforts of mssrs crystal and williams they deserve better and so do we	16
1	the acting is so bad in this horror film prettey corney mov	16
1	i an not a prude but i watched this movie after it was recommended by a friend i watches this movie with a pretty liberal girlfriend and we both found it to be extremely vulgar and not even funny with the exception of the fist scene and the language was ridiculous and gross ! yuk	16
0	i was thrilled to find this set here on amazon and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly all of the dvd 's have some good interviews with the producers designers voice actors and other people associated with the show i do n't usually like watching interviews things where people talk a lot but i love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was i totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different	16
1	where to begin \? cliched pretentious flat static maudlin melodramatic homophobic and finally just plain boring start with an over the top caricature of a deaf mute patsy cline young drag queen arriving the big city pile on cardboard colorful characters like typical aids patient porno star and loud mouthed latina hot mamna and whaddya get \? an amateur film populated with some of the most unlikable unattractive characters ever all spewing some of the unbelievably bad dialogue ever written and to think the \( formerly talented \) director made the whole wide world also with d'onofrio \? go figure nice cover art though	16
1	after two decades since watching upstairs downstairs i rashly decided to buy the whole set ! ! ! ! as i watched the first episodes i realized my memory had played a scurvy trick on me ! the melodrama was a bit vulgar and very predictable ! later episodes of the set improved but not by much ! it was like watching a biplane that did n't quite make it over the trees at the end of the runway i hope you wo n't make the same mistake i did	16
0	fiestaware rocks ! the turquoise place setting is beautiful it is much brighter than the pictures on amazon com fiestaware is functional calssic and fun i love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this i highly recommend mixing and matching fiestaware i mix up colors that you would n't normally expect to go together and they usually look great	20
0	i was alittle skeptical buying these but they seem to be working great	20
1	i returned this item because it was too big for the brother es2000 sewing machine i bought it was very bulky and took up way too much room the machine rattled inside the case and slipped around it would probably be better for a larger machine	20
1	we 've had this for about five years the battery went dead but there is no way to change the battery the battery is soldered to the circuit board ! they expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost 20 each way ! i opened it up cut out the old battery and duct taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months cooks rice great though	20
1	we bought these for our two girls \( 2 and 5 \) so that they could have dishes matching out stoneware and they were great for a while now we are down to 1 out of the original 4 we ordered due to the plates cracking over time \( 5 months since we ordered \) they have n't been abused and have been washed in the dishwasher on no heat same issue with the bowls ymmv but when 3 out of 4 are dead i think there is a problem	20
0	i have had this desk for about a year now and feel this desk is perfect for anyone who does not have a lot of space and wants to add style and function the desk and hutch are easy to put together and sturdy i have all the matching pieces i recomend this product and trust products that come from target	20
1	lousy ! ! ! ! the handle design makes the cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold there is a big space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through i grate a lot of cheese and i am sorry i bought this grater	20
1	it amazes me that this model is being sold here since the product was recalled by the manufacturer a newer safer model is offered for just 10 more by vornado do your homework before you buy	20
0	you ca n't go wrong with this knife i use it almost as much as i use my 8 inch chef 's knife it holds an edge well feels light in your hand and has perfect ballance	20
0	finally a quiet vacuum with some serious suction ! i have a 200 year old farm house that really needs this vacuum and has been smiling since it arrived the suction power on this vac is high enough to clean cracks that have never before been cleaned the hepa filter means you really ca n't smell that you 've been vacuuming and the bags are a breeze to change also who can complain about having a hip appearing vacuum cleaner \? hey if you have to own one would n't you prefer to have one that 's easy on the eye \?	20
1	i would rate this zero but that option is not available the weight of the stainless steel is heavy exactly what i had expected for 18 8 however the top does not affix to the base it seems the threads inside of the top do not match with the threads on the base furthermore the pumper does not work leaving one to pour the liquid from the base that 's worse than our original situation with the unsightly bottle of liquid dishsoap on the counter yuck ! i do not recommend the purchase of this product	20
1	i'm sure it will get a 5 star if i ever get the item i placed the order on 2 6 07	20
0	i 've had this for over a month and i 've only made grilled chicken with squash and asparagus if you do n't marinate your meat it will get really dry easy to clean most of the time	20
0	this is a great pan i have a larger one but this one fits in my pressure cooker makes a wonderful cream cheese cake in the pressure cooker	20
1	the manufacturers of the this pan have the most wonderful glue to stick a label to the surface of the pan it took me 2 hours to get all the glue off the pan the pan comes sealed in plastic so there is no need to glue the label to the pan with some space age adhesive i had to use laquer thinner and steel wool to scrub the glue off now i have 2 brand new jelly roll pans that each have 2 scraped up spots on each pan think twice before you purchase this pan	20
1	short and not so sweet first unit did not work at all second unit worked for about 3 months then sporatically then quit i should have believed the other reviewers going to try the senseo supreme unit now	20
1	i did n't get this order did you credit my credit card if so email me with the conf number and when the credit was given	20
1	giving 2 stars on the suction alone hepa filter does n't self clean turn after one use a lot of dirt falls out from the hepa filter when removing the dirt box or collects behind the the dirt box if you do n't pay very close attention to aligning it just right i really liked how much dirt this thing pulls out of the carpet but it 's heavy and dirt just falls out a lot of dirt when emptying the dirt box i'm returning and not getting another after reading the other reviews in here that sound just like my experience	20
0	i have a manual sharpener but in reality almost never use it the electric sharpener makes keeping my knives sharp a no brainer there 's a coarse grinder for knives that are dull for most knives the fine and polishing grinder works just great if you have inexpensive knives the coarse grinder will chew them up but if you have well made knives the waring will work well i 've had good success with the waring	20
0	i just tried this out for the first time and i was impressed it baked evenly and nicely best of all the cake came right out i simply sprayed it lightly with non stick spray and baked due the flexibility of this product you do need to put it on a baking sheet for stability i will be buying more from this line	20
0	my parents live in florida so we got two of these and rechargable batteries for use in case of storms and power outages the fan is very quiet when operating i like the fact that it runs on batteries great addition to the hurricane survival kit !	20
1	the heater works fine but these heaters can leak oil all over your carpet delonghi would not do anything because it was beyond the warranty period i will not buy an oil filled heater again	20
1	as of today 3 24 i have not received this product very disappointed with delivery	20
1	i bought this board along with another brand this one falls off the sink and is constantly dumping my cuttings in the sink it also warped within one month of my purchasing it the wood has also splintered not my idea of a good cutting board i would not recommend it to my friends nor would i purchase it as a gift	20
0	i purchased this item last christmas and have used it to airate many red wines i have had no issues with the decanture being delicate infact we machine wash it after each use the only issue i have had is when we first recieved the decanture we had difficulty placing the dacanture in the stand correctly other than that it is a wonderfully stylish piece of glassware when not being used and a quality redwine decanture	20
0	this is my first electric litter box i have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up it really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box it was a breeze to set up i also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats' bathroom floor and with the tent they ca n't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a bm on the floor i'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down	20
0	i bought this as a gift for my husband after reading a hundred reviews made my choice this little machine does n't do anything fancy it grinds beans we have n't used it for anything else since we bought it to grind beans it does a great job it 's easily put together nothing spills it 's easily used not much else to say	20
0	this stainless steel stock pot is just right for those of us who ca n't fit our favorite soup recipes into a dutch oven cleaning it is a breeze and it is still small enough to fit on a convenient cabinet shelf that says it all	20
0	this is a great product very quick to heat and i enjoy the dettachable base feature the cons include a limited amount to pour water into the unit \( the lid does n't pop up very far \) and some of the finish does n't do great with steam overall a good buy	20
0	i burned up countless lesser spatulas before i found this one try as i might i can not damage it not even in cast iron cookware get one and see for yourself	20
1	people who complain that the aerosol can is empty the next day should listen closely to the product the one i ordered will leak as long as the mechanism is attached to the aerosol can i have tried reconnecting it many times using different pressure as i push down but to no avail at 10 dollars a night this product will get very expensive very quickly if it had worked without the leak i would have given ssscat 5 stars	20
1	poor carafe design makes this mr coffee machine a waste of money we bought this model to replace our old mr coffe machine after we broke the carafe and could n't purchase a replacement for that model we loved our old mr coffee but this purchase was completely dissatisfying because as other reviewers have noted it 's virtually impossible to pour without spilling the coffee water everywere after the first few uses we decided to purchase a different coffee maker	20
1	i should have read the other review more closely this is a good blanket for hot summer nights ! i believe it is too light for cold winter nights i expected more for over 50 if i did n't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw ! the color and texture are nice	20
0	i am starting this collection for my mother it is so adorable i love that it can be dressed up or down	20
1	hopefully i will never make this kind of mistake	20
0	it 's well made sturdy good looking pet crate i bought the small first for my 12 pound cat and it was much too large so i exchanged it for the extra small and it is just right remember that it 's a crate so do n't look for the handle	20
1	i prefer my spoons to stand upright many of my spoons fall out of this one i guess it depends on your shape of the spoon	20
1	i thought this breadbox was beautiful in the picture and unique because of the two compartments the construction however is horrible the wood was split at the screw locations on the lid i returned the box and received another one the wood was split at the screw sites on the bottow of the second box it is very poorly put together and the material is cheap this certainly is not worth the price	20
1	we are very disappointed in the peformance of this toaster the bread will toast good on the inside but barley on the outside i sent email to west bend and was told the maybe the bagle switch was stuck no help if i return it shipping cost makes it not worth it good appearance and company name fooled me fy	20
0	this is a very nice piece of furniture well built good quality it was shipped via ups and the box was quite damaged when it arrived thank goodness for good packaging or it would have been destroyed one of the doors did have a crack in it and a new door is to be shippped shortly a new mode of shipping should be considered	20
1	package arrived quickly oven looks really nice oven burns toast even on lowest settings !	20
0	the wonder washer appears cheaply made but works fairly well if you follow the instructions and not overload the machine it augments my regular washer nicely washing small loads and delicate items well on the debit side the washer 's design precludes having a bottom drain plug on the wash basket a drain plug would have been useful for more effective rinsing of the washed items the manufacturer also should have included a hose that attaches to a faucet so the wash basket can fill up quickly	20
0	these pans are great they are very sturdy and good quality do n't buy anything else ! trust me	20
0	excellent for fall spring here in florida fans have a reversible switch which is very handy \( do n't have to turn the whole fan around \)	20
0	very nice warm blanket but too big for a full size bed way too big	20
0	i took a chance on ordering these and i'm glad i did they are heavy duty ! i like the handles as i do a lot of microwave cooking and it 's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware i 've also used these in a convection oven and them seem to work really great ! i picked the sapphire color and they are very attractive on the table as well !	20
1	my company bought one of these to replace the similar capressa 1000 machines which finally broke after n years after 2 days the led readout of the functional information stopped working the machine continues to operate but you ca n't tell what 's going on how much water it will use for your particular cup etc very disappointing we 'll see how good the warranty repair is and report back to you after we experience that	20
0	this product is a must have for anyone serious about baking this mixer is by far the best appliance that i have purchased for my kitchen next to the refrigerator of course i reccomend this product to anyone who loves to bake the 5 quart was worth the money do n't buy the 4 qt save the money and purchase the 5 you 'll be glad that you did	20
0	a few scratches on the wheels and here and there but looks new overall it works like new probably not a perfect vacuum but works well parts are available if you need them not a top of the line but neither is the price at 60 70 with free shipping	20

0	i am very pleased with the chemire dinnerware set it is very durable and the colors are great the dishes are larger than i had expected they are a little heavy due to the size and thickness i would recommend them to others	20
0	being used to the swiftness of the roomba \( 10 stars ! \) the scooba seems very slow it does not follow the wall as much as the roomba but at the end of the cycle the floor is clean and sweet smelling on the downside my carpet is at the same level as the flooring so i have to put up barriers to keep the scooba on the hard surface only in rooms where the floor is lower than the carpet scooba keeps to the hard surface just fine	20
1	i set it up for my dogs because they bark whenever they hear a noise or if someone rings bell i have 3 dogs i put it on and they went beserk they started going after each other i did n't hear anything myself but i am quite sure the dogs did like i said they acted very badly towards each other the tone must have made them lash out like that i cannot use it anymore	20
1	i bought this oven recently it is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job all except the rotisserie when used grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full i was very dissapointed i contacted them via email today they say they will get with me in 24 hrs we 'll see	20
1	with an old coffee can true it does n't have the odor free aspect but if you are scooping a litter box there is going to be odor i just keep the can by the box and dump it in the trash when full same deal	20
1	i really like the look of this bread bin but the manufacturer does not package it in a box it only has a clear plastic bag around it even though amazon uses it 's own box for shipping it arrived with dents and cracks amazon quickly replaced it with another one which had dents cracks and the entire bottom was was badly scratched i do n't have time to keep sending these back hoping to get a replacement which is n't damaged so i gave up after returning the second one	20
1	when this fountain is freshly cleaned the cats love it the water does stay cool but cat hair lots of that around here clogs the pump and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly it grows slime eeeeuuuw the first pump lasted about three months then the replacement lasted about a month not really worth it because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway	20
1	heavy machine looked durable almost commercial put her together and began within 5 minutes of use the belt for the rotating brush burned up and the brush no longer rotated ! returned it the following day and bought a bissel that has worked great was cheaper and weighs less !	20
1	if you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment this is n't for you the radio is hard to use since it does n't have any indication of what frequency you are on and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static the pedometer function is marginal at best but its what you would expect for 15	20
0	the grill is a significant improvement over my previous weber in regards to grill area regidity of the cast iron grill control for raising or lowering goals large charcoal shelf three compartments within the charcoal shelf heavy guage metal construction the option of adding a rotisseriethe grill is wanting in regards to lack of an enamel coating on the cast iron grill lack of closable upper and lower vents which would enable greater temperature control and the ability to seal the grill interior when finished in order to snuff out the coals	20
1	people cliam this fan is quiet it 's not quiet i wanted a fan that will circulate the bedroom air during the night it 's too loud and keeps me awake	20
1	as a starbucks employee of almost 2 years at my college i know how to brew espresso and properly make drinks my roommates got this for me as a christmas present at the field days sale so i could make coffee drinks for all of our late night study sessions after about 2 months of use the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead i contacted a service advisor at krups' website and it turns out that i would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in illinois on my own dime no thank you ! i 'll find something better	20
1	i would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone the coffee does taste funny and i did n't realize it might be the metal pot also do not pour the coffee unless your cup is over the sink as one quarter of the coffee spills out just like one of the other reviewers said the pot does not slide in and out easily not a coffeemaker i would recommend the only thing i like about it is the size ! ! ! ! ! !	20
1	i grind beans for my coffee every morning i was using a krups grinder and decided to switch to this quieter grinder sold the old grinder in a garage sale i do regret buying this grinder it is loud and takes 30 seconds to grind instead of 10 my main complaint is that it is messy the grounds stick to the sides and bottom and i have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out i am tempted to purchase another krups before i break this one by beating the grounds out of it also coffee grounds are everywhere i always have to use a cloth to clean up not a good buy	20
0	for an inexpensive pizza stone it does the job if you 're looking for something that is more versatile look somewhere else this stone is primarily for breads pizza and the like i know this because i tried baking cookies on it the cookies turned out fine but they stuck to the stone however when i make home made pizza from scratch the crust comes out perfect ! not too soft not too crisp it bakes it perfectly all the way through with a nice golden crust	20
1	this product arrived in what appeared to be good shape but upon washing became blotchy and discolored in places making them unusable very disappointed	20
1	the electric skillet takes forever to heat up and it does not heat in the corners also it takes longer to cook than an electric frying pan i would not recommend this product thank yo	20
0	still find it somewhat big for a dorm room \( but if you have a double and are sharing the fridge this much room is probably necessary \) but works great	20
1	the seals are not air or water tight there is no problem with the cansiter or the clear window but i cannot store any flour or rice type products as the seals are not airtight and allow bugs in them the canisters themselves do not rust and the lids are not easy to remove	20
1	i bought this unit a few years back worthless at best ! i wish someone even the mfg could come up with some kind of solution to retain the heat with these units i called their customer service who said good luck as their best solution the problem is aluminum cools off too fast it will not retain heat i wish i could locate a cast iron krumkake ! do they make them anymore \? ebay help ! !	20
1	we ordered a cherry coat rack \( keep in mind cherry is the only color option available on this site for that item \) and it came as light oak i tried to get it exchanged but they were going to make me pay for shipping cause it wasnt their fault i dont know whose fault it is but i ordered a cherry i got something totally different and their customer service didnt service me and wasnt customer friendly never again	20
0	i am looking for a new book light and as a former owner of this light i was suprised at the bad bulb stats this bulb like halogen bulbs get very hot it is imperative that you do not touch the bulb with your fingers when installing or adjusting it the oil from your skin heats the bulb to a higher temp and hastens failure hope this help	20
1	this unit can only dry half of what it can wash which is not that much it takes a total of 4 1 2 hours to do one load of laundry if you only put 11lbs of wash in i have a family of five and i am over run with laudry because of this machine ! !	20
1	the way the brush is situated on the handle makes this brush difficult to use i would get the furminator instead it has the same deshedding edge but a much easier to use overall design and it comes in larger sizes ! this technology is great and you will be so shocked when you see all the hair you are able to remove	20
1	functionally this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner it is not attractive to look at however my walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish the varnish is very high gloss and the knobs are low grade mismatched junk i believe the build is solid but only time will tell final word pay the extra money for a hand crafted cabinet where you can pick the finish and you can talk to the craftsman personally this just is n't worth 300	20
0	this knife along w the matching 7 5 star meat fork are my weapons of choice for carving leg of lamb prime rib ham veal turkey etc at various carving stations at my job i love the 5 star line have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife i 'd recomend trying the 4 star pro s line out as well before deciding on this line \( same blades different handles \) i 'd definately replace if lost stolen after using proper tools there 's no way you can go back to cheap knives i 'd love to see a 12 version of this knife w a wider blade	20
1	they take batteries but do n't last 15 minutes they have an ac spot for and adapter but where do you plug a undercounter light in under the counter hate them	20
0	i have ordered two of these from this vendor both times the product was received almost a month after i ordered it the product is nice and of good construction but again if you need this in a hurry choose another place because they dont know how to mail it right out	20
1	too expensive too little heat unit quit after a year of intermittent use i wo n't buy vornado again	20
0	i have found this to be the best i have ever owned my daughter had gotten one and finally my old one conked out and i just had to have a bunn also i envied my daughter 's ability to make coffee in literally three minutes i used to only have 12 cup capacity pots but there is no need for it now the best is that you can always have a fresh cup of coffee and it is always hot it makes a clean cup of coffee easily and efficiently we are thrilled with this product and highly recommend it anyone and everyone this will be our brand of coffee maker forever	20
1	it looked okay when i opened it then i washed it before using and my washer and dryer were full of cranberry colored lint \( wet in the washer and dry in the dryer \) the next time i washed it was better but still some lint in the washer and normal in the dryer it is not warm enough alone it might be okay in the warmer months but not what i expected for winter	20
0	i highly recommend the spiegelau authentis line for value and beauty these glasses truly do enhance the experience of the wine and are priced so that you can enjoy them every day while a delicate and beautiful showcase for wine they are also sturdy enough to stand up to being used \( and washed ! \) on a regular basis if you are looking to amp up you wine drinking experience give these a try	20
1	i 've had my futon a little over two months and was very happy with it initially until one day two of the wooden slats which are all held in place with plastic fell apart \( and i only weigh 100lbs \) i tried everything to fix the problem to no avail so considering it only lasted a few months it really is not worth the money at all the price is cheap but so is the quality for what it will cost me to replace this one i could 've bought a much better quality futon without the disappointment and aggravation	20
0	love it ! rechargeable seems to last better than battery operated ones the design has improved too i have had two of them i love how you can dismantle this one so it wo n't break if packed away makes good froth too	20
0	well i used it in my restaurant and yes it was okay not the best of the best but for 11 bucks it was good enough to measure basic not exact amounts so if you need something for appoximate amounts i say go for it not bad for the price i recommend it but also will say it will not take to much abuse its made of plastic	20
1	not a good light the light is already fading and i do n't use it very often very disappointed	20
1	it is best to invest a few more dollars and purchase a better itemlight and not providing the warmth expected from this price level feels incomplet	20
0	this is great it is very easy to clean just put it in the dishwasher you never have to worry about getting honey or syrup all over again it pours very clean and does n't drip after you 're done it looks very nice too great deal with a classy look	20
0	these are gorgeous bowls they are my preferred bowl for baking and cooking i am very satisfied with them no discoloration problems and they clean up very easily and they look fantastic on my pot rack	20
1	this sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access however it is not a good sharpener it sharpens knives but not well also it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash probably half a year and it will be useless spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year	20
0	not only do these burgundian clay pie pans look wonderful they also bake the most perfect pies i have ever put together the crusts come out even and just that great combo of crisp yet tender and flaky i use martha 's pate brisee recipe but with these pans it is foolproof ! i have the big one for meat pies and 2 of the regular size for sweet pies and quiches wonderful	20
0	impressive machine overall i 've had a problem with some carpets causing the beater bar to stop resulting in the loud percussive clicking of the beater bar clutch looking around on the internet this seems to be fairly common i understand the clutch is there to prevent issues with the beater bar breaking things but the clutch seems a bit weak on mine the attachments are great for hard floors and furniture i am amazed at what it pulls out of my carpets every time i use the machine but the beater bar is pretty annoying for a machine at this price point even the refurbished one	20
1	a year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash the swing out filter hinges broke during normal use once broken the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed hence it 's ready for the wastebasket on closer inspection the entire filter unit is made of plastic and the hinges are only a few mm 's in diameter sturdier design needed !	20
0	i love going to other peoples party 's and sharing a few drinks but never had a good way to carry to bottles of bubbly or other drink of choice before this product i purchased an orange one last year and like it so much i'm giving them as gifts this holiday season they fit almost any round or squire 750ml bottle \( absolute sky captain jose cuervo bushmills \) however oddly shaped bottles a bit of a tight fit like baileys	20
0	great ! i love it ! ! goes great with my kitchen	20
0	i bought this decanter as a present for my father and he has definitely been getting a lot of use out of it it is easy to use and works well at keeping the wine preserved i definitely recommend it i just wish it were a little cheaper since the design is not so special	20
0	very loud and heavy i have used lighter and less noisy vacuums in the past this one does pick up hair and lint very well seems to deep clean for the price it was a good deal	20
0	works great i purchase 3 one for my husband and 2 more for my children good design however it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a blackberry an ipod and a gameboy the station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time	20
0	i love these pieces i plan on using them as decorative items when not being used to entertai	20
0	i used this skillet for the first time and it was great i love cast iron but the enamel coating sure made this easier to use it cleaned quickly and required no seasoning also its a really pretty skillet the sellers were really good also about emailing with order status updates shipping info and the skillet came quickly through fed ex very good customer service	20
1	i ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof the coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when i tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me it is a very frustrating mug to drink from the only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot	20
0	i almost did n't purchase these because of the reviews but my son likes thomas so i did i was expecting really rough but i do n't think they are all that bad maybe the company has taken the reviews under consideration and changed material anyway the boy is quite happy with them and sleeps quite soundly	20
0	of all my global knives i have bought recently this is my favorite i just love it it is very light and so easy to use and has so many uses and especially good for peeling vegetables one of my best buys	20
0	i bought this glass for my wife \( who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine \) as a christmas gift last night she tried out the glass with a friend the reviews from both of them were quite something to watch the wine from this glass tasted far far superior to the same wine from an ordinary red wine glass in fact they poured the remaining wine from the ordinary glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening there was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different superior one	20
0	i ordered this item because i know wusthof has a reputation for quality i find the kitchen shears sturdy and sharp especially appreciated are the easy separation feature of the blades for washing and the handy lid gripper for opening jars and bottles	20
0	i love this salad spinner it works easily for two people spins great and best of all it keeps salad incredibly fresh for many days i highly recommend it	20
0	this timer was a christmas gift for mom she loved it she thought it was very cute	20
0	this worked as promised and turned out some very dainty little madelines cute as a button ! it works the same as the large madeleine pans and is made from the same heavy weight metal but the result is darling would be great for tiny garnish on a larger dessert for a tea or just because some people prefer small doses of good things !	20
0	these pans are light and clean up great just do n't use metal in them will buy more	20
0	i am a boy when i bouhgt this stuff it was the first time live without my family i do not know the cookwre set but my female friends always say where did get it \? or it look really expensive they alway said it 's good and reasonable price	20

1	unless you look like popeye and or have the ability to rip phone books in half with your bare hands you will struggle to wring this mop out even if you can move the wringer the handle sections slide apart i spent more time putting it back together and cursing than actually cleaning the floor	20
1	when i first got this item i loved it i used it 4 times and it stopped working	20
0	the filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier it works really well	20
0	cooking is actually a pleasure when you have tools that are as colourful and cheerful as this little pot it is just beautiful to look at and a joy to use \( i never thought i could get so excited about a simple pot ! \) this little green pepper cooks evenly in the oven or the stovetop and clean up is a breeze i 've use this to make casseroles for 2 4 sides for 4 6 even soups and sauces jambalaya is one dish particularly well suited for this pot straight from simmering on the stove to the table it 's gorgeous i'm planning to get the tomato or pumpkin next	20
1	i bought this as my second fryer the third time i used this fryer the oil went up and came out of the fryer then the lid would n't close properly and that 's the end of it prior to buying this fryer i had the presto fry daddy for years and it worked fine	20
0	looks and works just as advertised took it out of the box and used it the day we received it made for a lovely and lively family dinner great buy	20
1	this coffeemaker makes the worst coffee of any i have owned in 26 years it brews very quickly losing a cup or more of the water added in steam that just pours out of the top the coffee is weak and bitter \( no matter what brand we have tried \) about the 4th time we used the pot it overflowed creating a mess of grounds and coffee all over the countertop we thought maybe we had put the carafe on the base incorrectly and were careful to always be sure it was pushed in completely from then on the same thing has happened twice more this coffeemaker is a piece of junk	20
1	the image in this product is misleading it looks like this product contains more than 1 piece but when i opened it i got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior	20
1	cute bookshelf looks goods and serves its purpose however the tips of it that screw together break really easily we were using it at trade shows where we put it up and took it down once a week it only lasted through 3 shows two tips snapped off the last time we unscrewed it even though we put very little weight on it when it was in use and no weight or funny angles on it when unscrewing probably would work well if you never plan to take it down but i 'd question how much weight it can hold over a long period of time	20
0	we use this to serve ice water at meals it is so beautiful it holds a full 2 qts not much else to say about it it is a water pitcher after all it is a pretty piece that just looks great on the table we have two one for each end of the table	20
0	this came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the holidays as a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation as a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb chickens it 's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck the pan looks good from oven to table yes it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron but i'm really glad to add this to my pantry	20
1	my little 2 years boy is crazy about thomas friends his bedroom was decorated with thomas but the drapes is very low quality material looks like drapes sold at dollar stores for 3 99 no soft is like when you use ironing starch i left only 1 start because matching with the bedding ! i used only one pair with denim drapes liner under to block out light because i opened package the other set i send back to amazon i do not recommend this product and if your boy likes dark room to sleep do not buy ! ! ! i bought pottery barn thin wale corduroy panels are excellent light material and block out light	20

1	we finally broke down and went looking for a complete set of quality kitchen knives the name wushof came up several times and we purchased a set of them they work well until they started getting dull sooner then i thought they would i have numerous sharpening stone \( ceramic diamond \) and buffing wheels and sharpened them myself to a razors edge again they worked well but soon became very dull we were very careful in the storing and handling of them which made no differance they are well balanced looked well made but are over rated and priced the 2 mac japanese knives we have stay sharper longer take abuse better and sharpen easier	20
0	these are great and match the duvet cover wonderfully i am very pleased with my purchase !	20

1	i was very upset with these sheets and how much lint is still coming off it totally clogged my dryer i have washed them 3 times and i still come up with a trap full should have sent them back	20
0	i just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum it cuts the cleaning time in half from 8 10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop and spraying the box down down to only 2 minutes it 's just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes litter maid products i 've seen and the price is reasonable i wish i had this for my previous cats i 've owned	20
0	why would you get a smaller toaster oven when you can get this one at such a good price \? it works well looks good and you can actually fit things in it never be frustrated by what you ca n't fit in your toaster oven !	20
0	i was a little hesitant to spend over 10 for a splatter screen as most of them really are n't worth more than a few bucks however i am very glad that i spent the extra money on this one the quality of this item is top notch it 's much more sturdy than any others that i 've seen i 've been using this splatter screen for a few months now and still love it the feet on the bottom are very helpful in controlling messes the handle is terrific \( some screens only have either a d ring on the top or a thin handle \) and seems to stay cool while in use this even got raves from my mother	20
1	my girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon this is by visiondecor furniture first it shows up on the curbside in pieces did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together \? this is not including the cushions the material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy i do n't know if it will last a year ikea furniture is actually better quality paid around 550 with shipping if she would have spent another 200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in los angeles she is very disappointed and wants to cry sad very sad	20
0	this pillow holds the heart shape better than i expected from some of the other reviews we have been careful so that it does not burst because of others warnings about the mess still my daughter has made good use of this pillow and still sleeps with it every night	20
0	i was pleased with these canisters the lids do not screw on but seem to be airtight with the rubber seal the only complaint i have is that they appeared to be shiny in the photo but are actually brushed stainless	20
0	it is big and heavy but a real workhorse mixes things we would only do by hand before	20
1	not functional bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it impossible to use the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly also it came in a box that was damaged and taped together \( not the shipping box the polder box that the product comes in \) looks like someone returned it previously \( probably for the same reasons \) and it was then sent to me i still have it because i was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted time to throw it out waste of money	20
1	looks nice but the roll does fall off and thick paper towels can rub the top edge of the unit closest to the cabinet item is being returned	20
1	the first time i used it i could n't even boil water in it on my flat surface stove ! a notice that came with it said this pot may not work on all stoves refer to the owners manual \( no owners manual was sent with it \) as soon as the water started to heat the pot danced and wobbled all over and the water was sloshing out of the top ! nothing in the web site ad referred to the pot not working on a flat surface it would have been nice to have known before ordering as i am not a pro cook and have no special knowledge of these details	20
1	this fan does not have enough power to even come close to blowing out the hot air from even the smallest room go for the industrial strength expensive ones	20
1	i have owned this blanket for less than a month so i cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability but the first \( and only \) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime and the dye used on the moss green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent i gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm and has an attractive weave	20
0	we have had this unit for 6 months and we really enjoyed it it makes a great cup of coffee it is easy to use and we do not understand why some other reviews complain then without any warning it stopped working i called hamilton beach and they are sending a free replacement no questions asked the unit has a hassle free 3 year warranty and it really was a snap we are glad we bought this unit and are happy with how hamilton beach stands behind their products	20
1	i followed the instructions many times but still ca n't get the cork pulled out of the wine bottle the oster wine opener cork screw goes in just fine however instead of pulling out the cork the cork screw just reverses direction and comes out of the cork i'm 75 and bought this after reading a review on how great it was for older folks with arthritis well maybe i have a lemon but i certainly would love someone from oster tell me is i'm doing something wrong thank you for the opportunity to bring this to someone 's attentio	20
1	i bought this blender because i liked its retro design and i thought it would function well well every single time i 've tried to use it has been a disaster even for very simple tasks like blending soft avocado the blender has not worked the blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything it 's horrible and i even threw away my old ugly blender when i bought this one and the other worked just fine	20
0	great product too bad the shipping cost as much as the produc	20
1	i got these sheets and was very pleased with them at first after a couple of days i observed color sticking to everything around the worst it painted my matress in red color ! ! i tried my best to remove the color but it wont go away now i found the best place for these sheets in the attic	20
1	this was a seventh anniversaty gift and being made of copper is its only real benefit two of the welded connections between the rings were broken upon receipt and it 's light and relatively shabby in construction it 's difficult to find a 7th anniversary gift made of copper and to that end this fit the bill but its real value even for the intended purpose is very limited	20
0	beautiful good quality bowls heavy and thick they wo n't break easily vibrant colors i 'll be buying more	20
0	after going through several nathan 's cheap stovetop grilles i realized that although i love grilling food i needed a good grill pan i did not wish upon a star but a dream came true with this marvelous cooking aid i use it evry day it nrver sticks and the heat is so evenly distrubuted that everything comes out perfect ! it also is a handsome addition to my kitchen	20
0	this is a well built pizza peel i gave 4 starts instead of 5 because it showed that it was in stock and would ship with 2 day delivery they actually were out of stock and it came a week after i really needed it	20
1	i ordered this timer and was excited this was stylish and red to match my kitchen this ended up being a nuisance purchase as i have to return it ! it ticks but the bell does n't ring at the end also i was disappointed in it 's packaging as well as the item itself it does not look upscale the plastic is not nice but cheap looking and the metal part is actually painted plastic if you are looking for a classy gift or decoartor item look elsewhere !	20
0	i bought this to hold some of my overflow knives that would not fit into my knife block it has proven to be very handy it seems well made im not expecting miracles from a knife tray so that doesnt really say a lot but it is sturdy and nice looking it occupies about half of a drawer which leaves plenty of room for the rest of the non sharp cooking utincils to sit next to it i have now switched its intended purpose slightly insead of just holding the overflow from my counter top knife block this now holds my most commonly used knives the real knife block now sits farther away in the corner occupying the overflow from this one	20
0	they worked so well we decided to have a themed drink for our superbowl party this year it was in miami so we went for pink flamingos and palm trees we served cubano sandwiches and mojito cocktails the mojito 's were a hit we set up a mojito education station on our computer playing the bacardi mojito video then we had a station set up with mint sugar rum lime wedes ice and soda water this muddle was an excellent purchase it did the job efficiently and well even mojito novices got the hang of it easily great buy and good luc	20
1	i hated these shakers i got them as a gift and 1 they are too big and take up too much space and 2 the rubber stoppers were not a tight fit so the salt and pepper was always leaking out the bottom and 3 the holes in the top are too big and too much comes out at once finally one broke and i was thrilled to toss them out the other smaller fiesta ware ones the round ones are much much better	20
1	this is not and i repeat is not a good alarm there is one alarm light and you can hardly tell which one is sounding it looks as if the specs are lying to me and i hate lies also the battery died after 6 8 months the low battery alert is loud and chirps so anoyingly i also noticed that the alarm sounds a loud shrieking alarm when it sounds i will return this alarm never again will i trust in first alert	20
1	read the info about this product carefully this listing is not for kitchen scissors but rather poultry shears chef 's choice does make the 8 kitchen scissors in the picture but that is not what you will get if you order these i had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas i am now returning the poultry shears to amazon	20
0	this bread slicer is quite good it has a slicing guide and also a storage container part to it it cleans easily and was cleverly designed to accomodate bread machine sized loaves i have found though that if i bake the largest size loaf the loaf will be an inch or so to tall for it so after i slice a few slices i am able to put loaf on its side and then store it in the container	20
0	have had the granos for about 1 month great espresso great latte and great design i hope all the leak issues i read below have been solved but only time will tell	20
1	the bissell 2680b perfect sweep dual brush sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep this defect in the design which uses sections instead of one long pole makes it impossible to use without aggravation we have put tape around the pole but it does not work now we are going to try screws to hold it together i never saw anything like this in my life and hope i never do again	20
1	i love the sango nova brown dishware and rate it 5 stars this boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight the slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer 's comments mine too arrived broken sure seems like sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping i sure hope amazon gets credit from sango for all these broken pieces combined score 2	20
1	the item is not packed well for shipping the drawer and top were cracked when i called the number on the replacement part i was told did not have the replacement they gave me a number to call for target they in turn told me they could n't send it and told me to call the number i had just called unreal trying to get this fixed i am going to have to pack the whole thing up and return myself no help in getting this taken care of	20
1	when i opened the product the sheets really were soft but when you 're laying on them they are n't very comfortable i would n't buy another set again but they were cheap so not a horrible buy	20
0	i bought this for my two classic revere ware 2qt pots \( marked clinton ill \) and steamer attachment and this piece fits fine on all three pieces all of today 's revere ware including this lid are made overseas the pots now seem to be made of a much thinner gauge of steel but this glass lid works fine	20
0	simple straight forward to use very easy to clean and durable ca n't beat it for the price better than any drip	20
1	do n't buy this wok it tastes like you are eating metal when you cook cabbage with tomatoes i ended up returning the second wo	20
1	i received the set in the mail and immediately noticed that the contents inside were damaged i returned the item to amazon who issued a prompt refund it appears that the persons handling these fragile items are n't very cautious so i would advise against buying this amazon was great with a prompt refund though	20
1	this percolator is not worth the price the coffee tastes lousy and it does not stay hot i returned mine and purchased the farberware fcp512s 12 cup cordless percolator i love it !	20
0	i have never used any other dehydrator 's and found this very simple to use clean store and the price was great plus it makes my house smell great when i'm using it so far i have only dehydrated fruits and vegetables and still have to get used to how long to leave things in the machine and how to prep them however the instructions really makes it very easy and overall i'm finding it enjoyable to use	20
0	this is a significant improvement over the 750 model the 750 model was not very well designed the first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic we returned this we got the 760 to replace that the 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem for the same price as the 750 the 760 comes with one extra bowl juicer and egg whisk compared with others like the cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed	20
1	i bought this for my mother in law at her request she has arthritis and saw it on tv she also wanted the free gripper that came with it i scoured the listings at amazon looking for one that included the gripper even paid a little more for it she used the can opener once and it broke the free gripper required sending away for it and an inflated s h fee	20
1	i ordered this table based on the reviews i read and boy i will never do that again this table is such poor quality and is not worth the money i am so disappointed in it that i shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it it is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy i would say this table is worth 20 and no more	20
0	i just bought my second one the first alarm hangs in our kitchen and does go off with a nice loud alarm when i seriously scorch dinner it 's easy to turn off with the huge button in front no false alarms here only goes off when there is smoke nearby	20
0	thest waterford flutes are absolutely beautiful i know that some may think they are a little pricey but its worth it they make a great bride groom flute glass for the wedding reception also its a great remembrance of your day ! they are so cute	20
0	i bought this fan on the recommendation of a friend at the end of a hot day the temperature inside of my apartment is higher than outside this fan takes care of removing the hot air and bringing in cool air from the outside it barely fit the width of my window but extender can be purchase afterwards if that`s a problem very easy to install and operate there is a thermostat so the fan turns on when the temperature gets too high perfect for smaller rooms also the price is definitely right	20
0	she asked for the little crockpot by golly she got the little crockpot	20
1	i have used a lightweight hoover for years and was very pleased with it when i first received this new cleaner i was really excited with the power it had the third time i used it the belt broke with each use my back would start hurting the forward motion was very easy but pulling it back was hard i returned this product because i felt there was something wrong with it	20
1	great coffee and a convenient size but the carafes keep breaking on me ! i used the original carafe just a few times before it broke i ordered a replacement and was extra careful when handling it \( especially when washing it \) i used the carafe maybe five times before it broke these things just seem to spontaneously combust the carafes are 12 a piece so it 's not worth replacing again argh	20
1	the description says you can adjust for coarseness of the salt pepper but there is no such knob on the mini grinders we replaced the store bought salt with sea salt and now the grinder does n't work disappointing	20
1	we have used krups products for years and been highly satisfied with them this coffee maker has two problems \( 1 \) its spout is badly engineered it is impossible to pour out the last 3 4 of an inch of coffee without taking off the lid \( 2 \) it is a thermos so the machine does not heat up the coffee but the pot preserves it at the temperature with which it is brewed i like hot coffee after the first cup i find that i have to heat up the remainder in the microwave this is inconvenient i would not buy another of this model	20
0	plastic bowl seems like cheap plastic the motor is great as it puree and chops	20
1	i could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived when i opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off when i looked at the pin i noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli i thought that was bad enough but when i turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces needless to say it 's useless this was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last	20
1	i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away	20
0	i loved my 8 inch global chef knife so much i ordered this veggie knife oh wow this thing is perfectly balanced and because of it 's smaller size it is just about perfect for most veggies it also fits in your hand extremely well if you are going to cut up a potato it is hard to beat the chef 's knife however for cutting up a tomato carrot etc this thing is the best tool i have ever used just wonderful	20
0	love this product excellent cheese cutter three choices of thickness highly recommended	20
0	i have this bowl and the larger one they are perfect bowls for mixing the rubber base really helps the bowl stay put i was them in the dishwasher without any problems	20
1	i saw an ad for rabbit comparing it to reidel it is no reidel heavier than i expected and larger than i expected	20
0	i got this wok for christmas as a gift it is perfect you are able to cook just about anything on this at a high heat without worrying that the food will stick to the bottom of the pan it is easy to clean so far i have cooked stir fries and potatoes with chorizo each time the food came out perfect not undercooked or over cooked	20
0	great pot i'm annoyed at having to press the unlock button everytime the one that prevents accidental spills the automated dispensing is too slow for my tastes i'm used to an earlier version that you have to press down from the top in hindsight i should have bought an earlier version to avoid the differencesi'm also really annoyed at the shipping bought through amazon it was shipped in the box that the manufacturer put it in which was n't up for the rigors of shipping but honestly i ca n't tell if the gaping crowbar looking inflicted holes were caused by the shipping or no	20
1	my gf loves popcorn so i was tasked to purchase her a replacement for her cheapo 10 air popper i saw this one and thought what a great idea and bought it on the spot i had n't read the reviews here when i did my heart sank although some people did rate it high and said it was great sadly these may be closer to paid reviews because the consensus here seems to be true slow popping with small kernals it makes a mess as well with kernels everywhere if you like running through a batch of pops then do not look at this model it 's simply too slow and requires a breather it was returned yesterday	20
1	poor quality the cover leaks i had to return it back do not buy	20
1	the coffe table arrived broken the item where easy to asemble and look good	20
1	all 6 of of the glasses in my set were at least slightly misshapen one was positively a mutant ! the stems were not centered and there were for lack of a better description glass tumors where the bowls meet the stems the glasses were also thicker than i expected from spiegalau other spiegalau items i 've purchased have been superb so this could very well be an anomaly	20
0	like the other reviewers it would be nice if the plastic was metal but i love this little thing ! i usually have tons of honey everywhere just put a little hot water in the base let sit for a few minutes and it pours out great ! so easy that even my little kids can use it without making too much mess	20
1	i bought this cleaner for use in between major vacuuming it clogs very quickly without having swept up very much it is probably fine for floors without carpet	20
1	after reading the reviews on this product i thought it would be a great space heater for my apt i could n't have been more wrong it barely gets hot even on the highest setting and gives off almost no heat ! ! perhaps mine is defective or got broken during shipping but it was a huge waste of money i have had to go out an buy another space heater already it is so frustrating one word do n't !	20
1	after remodelling our kitchen i wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out when i saw the picture of the towel holder i thought it unique with its scroll work and would n't look like everything else i saw when i received it the first thing i noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible i tried with no luck to remove the stains the area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt ! all in all i would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship	20
1	the high tech commercial cooking surface began to come off at the third use of this griddle i do n't know what evenheat means in their product description but this griddle has a hot spot on the left side i'm in the market for a new griddle but i wo n't buy anything labeled broilking again	20
0	it 's kinda hard to imagine dimention on a non standart object it works and cleans i guess a bit small but for the money its well worth i	20
0	we bought two santas and two pacconi christmas trees when they were on a steep discount at amazon they were the best gifts we gave immediate hits with each couple one in their late 50 's one in the mid 20 's in each case the response was the same it 's like my childhood they are going in the living room each season vivid but soft these are superb decorations	20
0	i found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that i have ever bought they hold an edge well and have a good balance the integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives the only problem with the set is the steel hone i find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife that is the only detractor from the set	20
0	ove glove is great everything they say it is my husband is the chef it was my valentine 's day gift to him and he 's happy as a clam ! thanks ove glove	20
0	i really like this kitchen gadget as it different actually useful and my hands smell less like garlic thus far i have only used it to chop herbs onions and garlic so i ca n't debunk the mush mess i would simply say do n't pull the cord a lot if you 're worried about it i bought about 5 and gave them all out as x mas gifts	20
0	i bought this exact same slicer 20 years ago for my mom and it has lasted it 's a unique item that guests love and it 's easy to clean up as well	20
1	first i liked this press good coffee reasonable price but in 3 weeks operation the press itself has already broken the plastic holder for mesh filter has broken may be this pres is good for ones a year usage but not for everyday	20
0	this is a nice product it gets the job done i have to disagree with the one reviewer the description plainly states that the board is made of polyethylene the midnight granite signifies the color for 9 99 14x17 is a great price	20
1	the detector was simple enough to use although it required alot of batteries \( 8 \) but the results were mixed urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances even in areas where i knew there had been an accident it was difficult to spot the difference all in all i generally would n't recommend this \( although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what i believe is mold in the bathroom \)	20
0	they are n't kidding this thing is razor sharp it needed no tuning up before i used it for the first time the handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight which is unfortunate because i like the weight for chopping but the hollow edge design is wonderful the mushrooms and onions i sliced up were thin as paper and did n't stick to the blade i 'd recommend it	20
1	i wanted a humidifier that was silent but when i plugged this in not only could i hear it from the other room but it 's a high pitched whine i do n't know what to do about it i think i 'll probably just return it for something different	20
1	i purchased the f69204 for 150 on sale used once that year with good results it was another year before i tried to use again shortly after starting the motor it froze up and quit on disassembly i found that roller bearings are not used in the motor instead an oil soaked felt type bearing that failed the parts book said you could order the motor alone but when i attempted this i was told you had to order the complete motorizing unit for a cost of 90 plus shipping in the future i will stick with the cheaper middle grade units that i have had excellent results with and are cheap enough to discard and buy an new one if they fail	20
0	i absolutely love the new scarlet color by fiestaware mine did arrive in one piece which is a miracle as the box looked like it had been used for soccer practice sometimes i think those fragile stickers result in box abuse ! i was surprised at how small it was but it did say 6 and 6 it is you wo n't bake a pie in it \( unless you make individual ones \) but it will be great for dips and sauces	20
1	the decanter 's pretty the wine topper is okay however the picture is misleading these two items are clearly not meant to be paired the topper does not fit must have been very carefully balanced for the photo but it sure wo n't stay that way the topper is made for a bottled wine not a decanter	20
1	because just around the 60 day mark the chime turned into a terrible noise like something dying i just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser but a month later \( 3 months after original purchase \) the thing is spewing soap non stop wasted lots of soap this way changing the batteries did n't help soap just flows out until there 's none left to maintain some customer satisfaction sharper image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control	20
0	this is a strudy well built product it was very easy to install i did it in 15 minutes my wife loves it now she has a lot more room in her sewing room we opted to paint it but it can be stained also we reccommend it highly	20
0	great product at a great price the first shipment came broken and amazon replaced it immediately without the hassles of having to return a broken item thank you	20
1	this item comes with many warnings as it should it can be hazardous to use this heater with an adaptor for a two pronged outlet the product itself is of high quality and runs well just not when you are in the process of renovating a house	20
1	i bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6 10 times over the course of 13 months it stopped working i called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it ca n't be repaired i should just throw it away ! i had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless ! buy one at you own risk	20
1	thinking this would be an excellent gift for mr electronics geek light sleeper it became a pretty big joke \( and embarassment for me \) because some of the sounds that come out of this thing sound like a circus or a dying speak n' spell do n't bother buy the sound screens used in medical offices etc for half the price they 're so much better	20
1	as others have stated the gears are plastic and will fail after 1 to 2 years and no replacement parts to fix so the can opener has to trashed	20
1	i ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up big people food for my grandson it could not even grind up a soft hot dog ! we kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material \( painted gray to look like metal ! \) it just could n't do the job sheesh i mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder total waste of money also my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two junk	20
0	these tables are great i bought two of them solid wood classic design that will still look good in 10 years and easy no fuss assembly all this at a great price pick one up	20

1	omie izzy are brother sister kitties about 6 months old they received this as a gift it 's fun when someone plays with us with a chasing toy but we do n't play in it much on our own one of the wires broke already and we 've had it less than one month	20
1	before i purchased this product i read several reviews many of them very favorable this product was also recommended by the grout cleaning restoring company i recently used for my tile floors imagine my surprise and disappoinment when i discovered how utterly useless this product actually is it does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor and an even worse job of sucking it back up leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor i literally have to remop the entire floor every time i use it i 've tried other bissel products which were fine but this one is an expensive dud do n't waste your mone	20
0	the pizzelle baker performed very well the batches of pizzelles were excellent and the recipes included were good i recommend this pizzelle iron	20
0	i was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but i gave this set a try and love it the pieces are heavy enough to maintain a consistant heat and are very durable clean up is a breeze i am very happy with this set and will be purchasing other pieces	20
1	corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies usually \( but not always \) oxo products are good at making things easier to do i have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky you also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork poor design this time oxo	20
0	we are very pleased with the quality of this couch the leather is soft but durable the craftsmanship is excellent and it is very attractive also the delivery was exceptionally fast we highly recommend this product	20
0	this was a present for my brother who is in culinary arts school he loves it and the professor was very impressed with it 's quality if you 're looking for a quality knife this is the way to go ! wustoff and henckels are identical except for the stamped handle get one you know you want to	20
0	product arrived promptly in good condition ! this product costs twice as much at vets office somebodies making money ! ! !	20
1	i purchased this set of spoons because they are narrow and can fit into any number of spice jars i also wanted them because they are hinged and nest inside of each other take up little space after first use the pin fell out and the spoons became unhinged i tried to reassemble and the pin keeps falling out would n't recommend	20
1	the blender i received also smelled as if it was overheating and the tachometer did not work i am sending it back and will be asking for a refund this clearly is not a reliable blender	20
0	pros works well heats fast auto shutoff feature and visible water level are nice cons putting kettle on base requires lining up 3 slots which takes a little extra care and might result in damage to contacts if you 're not careful	20
0	it 's a towel not too much to say for more information read the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy by douglas adams very good quality resiliant color has n't faded despite being used to dry me off after falling into a creek being used as padding for my elbow at the firing range and wiping up spilled cleaning chemicals tough little bugger	20
0	getting those decanters to dry without spots can be problematic this is a big help the wide base allows better balance than you would think and is really very secure i would prefer a larger balance point but this does the job	20
1	received set and tumblers are not good quality the edges are quite sharp and the glass still sweats would not recommend	20
0	these are great ! the keep my drinks cold for a very long time and are top rack dishwasher safe ! !	20
1	after i read stories about problems chlorine causes in the shower chlorine i got this filter it turns out most water systems are using chloramine now a more stable additive instead of chlorine and this filter like most is ineffective at removing chloramine see if your water system uses chloramine and save yourself an expensive filter that probably does n't work	20
1	very hard to get any actual pepper to come out of this thing i just put some pepper on eggs and it took over 10 squeezes imagine trying to grind pepper out for a stock pot full of soup impossible	20
0	this tea kettle is simply devine to use no cords in the way no waiting for water to boil just let it sit on your kitchen counter and it 's all automatic looks beautiful as well i 've purchased many as gifts and have one at home and one on the boat thanks cuisinart for this product	20
1	we got this as a present and had high hopes to actually use it as a microwave it takes over 7 minutes to warm something up and forget about making microwave popcorn it just does n't pop the kernals overall lots of features but it 's the worst microwave i 've ever owned	20
0	this color is a bit too bright but the bag it very comfortable	20
1	while the pan handle stays cool the lid handle heats up with the pan you need a pot holder to use the cover i did n't like that	20
1	this is the last item i will ever purchase from sharper image it broke the second week i had it spewing hand soap at will and not when i placed my hand under the infrared sensor it 's pure crap stay away ! !	20
1	i'm not happy the filter needed changing one day out of the box we have soft water so this should have lasted a while difficult to hang on to when filling have to hold it like a baby does put out the air though and fits about anywhere	20
1	i loved this vacuum initially you can even see how much dirt it 's picking up ! however the shape of the filter severely limits suction almost immediately to where the vacuum wo n't pick up a speck of lint you ahve to empty the filter every 5 10 minutes i do not have a terribly messy household just one with no stairs going to the front backyard	20
1	it 's a beautiful mug \( we 've bought 2 \) but it drips does n't keep the temperature it 's a nightmare to clean and it 's not higienic unbelievable bad product	20
1	ok this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted it barely picks up even simple dirt and debris and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds not minutes also it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into bank of america and swipe a few mil really its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge stupid stupid stupid design the same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together its like a rubics cube a true waste of 40 bucks do n't buy this ! it does n't even look very cool	20
0	i owned an earlier similar model that was disappointing and never whistled once but this kettle worked very well and the whistle worked perfectly at first but after only about 6 weeks of use the flip up spout broke off actually just broke in half i replaced it with a chantal teakettle and so far so good	20
1	worked fine for about 6 months and then the inner surface failed i'm not sure precisely what happened but some part of the surface coating wore off and now it 's impossible to make a waffle that does n't stick completely to the waffle iron a complete waste of money	20

1	i did a lot of research and chose this juicer based on reputation motor power and style i exchanged the first one and am now going to have to exchange return the second one because it automatically turns off after about 90 seconds even if nothing is being juiced and the motor just runs ! it is not the electricity as i have used several more powerful appliances in the same outlet	20
0	i ordered these glasses to have extra for a party fun shape drew compliments i now shuffled them in to use as my everyday glasses \( all matching ! \) but i do have concerns with cleaning the larger glass with no dishwasher i handwash everything and i find it hard to reach down into the recesses at the base of the tall curved glass the smaller one is fine my hand reaches	20
0	this machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well the fan is very quiet i like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well my only complaint is that the blue lcd that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is very bright too bright for a bedroom really lights it up i 'll be looking for some way of safely masking it otherwise very nice but hope it lasts	20

1	i was not pleased with this griddle at all after reading the positive reviews i ordered it maybe mine was defective but every piece of french toast in the front of the griddle was on the verge of burning when i flipped them it did not cook evenly for me and the directions were unclear as to what you can actually put in the dishwasher oh well ca n't win them all	20
0	so far so good i have a 3mo shep that so far has a blast with this thing i saw one reviewer that said it tore apart and will update as time goes by so far i love them well she loves them easy for her to pick up when the ball is much larger than her mouth \( holes in ball \) the football shaped one bounces in odd directions but highly recommend the blue one as dogs see blue well \( color blind \)	20
1	it stopped working 6 months after the warranty ran out according to sanyo will cost more to fix than i paid while it lasted it worked fine	20
0	i received this as a christmas gift i 've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane i had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles i found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you 're flying it 's the best way i 've ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere	20
0	my husband received a similar bag for christmas that holds 6 bottles of beer we are scheduled to attend a formal event where we will need to bring 2 bottles of wine the black is perfect for the purpose and looks much better than a gawdy paper bag or bottle bag and we do n't have to worry about the bottom falling out the material is sturdy and for cold wines will insulate well	20

1	i bought this kettle in february 2006 i liked everything about it until its automatic on off switch died recently only two months after the purchase now the kettle wo n't turn on it was n't abused in any way and these kettles usually last for years and years the last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new proctor silex k4070 i wonder if my bad experience with this kettle was unique \? has anyone else had one with a short lived switch or was i unlucky \?	20

0	if you want the retro look and a super toaster this is the one for you toasts perfectly and looks great ! i 've had it about 4 months with no problems whatsoever make sure to measure your countertop area before ordering it 's a big toaster shape is unusual \( taller in back than the front \) which gives it a little character ! excellent !	20

0	works just fine for my needs i use it to press my 'wrinkle free' dockers the water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill but once it is filled it lasts a good long time heavy duty well constructed dependable unit first package 'disappeared' at ups when they shipped the first machine it was evidently damaged and returned back to amazon by ups \( probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing \) the replacement shipment arrived just fine and as always amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'	20

0	this set is a great way to get a few basic cookware pieces however once you start cooking with this truly outstanding cookware you 'll want to buy more over the years i have spent hundreds of dollars on another well known commercial cookware brand but all clad is far superior the stainless looks great and is a breeze to care for the handles stay comfortable and the pots are really well balanced making them very easy to handle they heat evenly and cook uniformly even over low and medium heat i am very pleased with all clad 's performance on my radiant cooktop i would recommend this line of cookware to anyone interested in quality and performance well worth every penny	20
1	i gave these 2 stars because they worked nice for the first couple of months even cut through chicken bones but just like the other reviews the spring rusted terribly and the spring tends to pop off too easily at the most inconvenient moment i used these for making chicken soup alot but noticed that it also does n't always come clean between the blades and when using on chicken i like to be extra careful so the next set i get i 'll look for a set where the blades unhinge to make sure they come clean and not from henckels this time	20
1	oversized is a big word for these towels and the quality of the cotton used is very low i washed them once and they already shrank what is worse is that they keep loosing pieces of cotton after i dry with them i have to spend 5 minutes getting rid of cotton bits stuck on my skin definitely a disappointing product even for its low pric	20

0	i got this for our 3 year old daughter 's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater it does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night i would n't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room the top and back do get hot although you 'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned bumping into it should not cause any burns i have n't noticed any odors or noises from it	20

1	we had a set of chicago cutlery knives for many years and thought they were good quality over time the wooden handles dried out and the blades did n't sharpen very well so we replaced them with this set but were very disappointed the blades rust after very brief exposure to water we are still using the old ones	20

0	i bought this lightwedge for my daughter who is 7 i found out that after i put her to bed she could not go to sleep right away she would use a flashlight to do little reading well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light it shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes my only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes i ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks they should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes but it does do the job	20
0	these are my favorite cookers so much so i bought this one for my friend	20
1	we have been searching for a solution to our very uncomfortable seats in our ford windstar van this cushion did not help	20
1	just when i thought i was getting used to everything being so much bigger in the us i should have taken more notice of the other reviews beautiful glasses but they are way too small my set will also be returned they are a really odd size somewhere in between any use i would have for them	20
0	this soap dish is beautiful practical and sturdy best of all it will retain all water and liquid soap leftovers in its tray leaving your bathroom clean and dry recommended	20
1	it looked like such a good idea on tv but that 's the thing about tv they did n't fit well on my stove at all and i could n't even put my other stock pots on my back burners at the same time also the bottom scratched after a couple uses !	20

1	the towel is quite soft however after using it your body will be covered with small fibers all over not recommended	20
1	i too received this item with chipped corners scratches and broken pieces unfortunately the cost hassle of shipping it back is not worth it so we 'll have to live with the damage it 's a nice looking desk otherwise but beware that the keyboard drawer does not fold down completely and may cause problems typing on the keyboard for long periods of time	20
1	i bought this and one of their wooden pizza peels i thought it would be ergonomically advantageous which it may be but on the first pizza i cut \( on the mountain woods peel \) the edge is now folded over a bit rendering the edge much much less sharp than out of the box so i would suggest you save your 3 and the out sized shipping costs and buy yourself a cutter that may last for a while	20
1	this sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use it removes the air with a fan there is air left in the bag it does n't create a vacuum the bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid the bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag i was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags they are thinner than ziploc bags you cannot use canisters with this one	20
1	we made two batches of iced tea in our maker we couldn't figure out why it was leaking but figured most of them do have spout problems my husband found a crack from the spout upward so out it went although the instructions say to adjust the spout we never touched it	20

0	i 've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning we 've experienced neither of these make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water ! it 's a great saucepan and the price was great highly recommended	20
0	the spatula is very good cooking in high temperatures on the stove the food does not fall through the slots it is so nice to not have the yoke broken when flipping the egg over when frying it is good for dipping out food out of dishes also the only thing was the loop on the end of the handle was broken when i received it it did n't hurt the function of the spatula it is a great tool to have in the kitchen	20
1	i bought three of these mugs based on a recommendation by mens health magazine none of the mugs works correctly and the chrome ring on the cover has come off of each one initially this looks like a great idea but if the slots do n't line up just right the mug will not work i have three of these mugs and each set of slots lines up differently stay away from this product if you wish to avoid agravation	20

1	we have had the cordless blender for 3 years now and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen clean up was a breeze too the worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery which withihn a year took less and less of a charge after each use now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once it does not surprise me that cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately which in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence but in turn cuisinart should not be surprised when i never buy another one	20
0	i 've had the grind and brew for almost 3 years and have never had any problems it makes great coffee it 's not that hard to clean and it has adjustable settings for temperature and coffee strength so if you fiddle with it a little you can get it to make exactly the coffee you want i gave one to my cousin a couple of years ago as well and it turned him into a total coffee addict	20

1	this towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric \( like dust bunnies \) formed on it too perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag but not in one 's bathroom	20

1	this grater is fine when you can get it to work but most often the handle does n't screw in correctly and you ca n't get it to it 's mostly a waste of time though the concept is a great one i 'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one	20

1	my steamer worked well for all of 5 mins the pole went from upright to a 45 degree angle without hanging anything on it and would not straighten out the defect appeared to be at the connection where the pole screws into the machine then within minutes i had water all over my hardwood floors i had the same problem as other reviewers the water tank kept leaking so off to the returns department we went i guess it steamed well for the five minutes that it worked \? not worth all the mess and hassle of returning it	20

1	i bought this wok 6 months ago i seasoned it very well and started to use it but i noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when i cooked the dish with a lot of sauce it meant i could n't use it for steaming when i made a fried rice i had a hard time to clean it and re season it most chinese use a wok to cook everything so i expected i could do that too but i was wrong this wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry that 's all	20

0	i 've had my juicer now for about 3 years and i have n't had any problems with it in fact after having had several juicers this one is my favorite in the price range i also do n't understand the customer service problems one of the rubber feet on the bottom split and i called customer service a week later i had four new ones in the mail ! pros much quieter than most juicers of its type as well i did a side by side comparison with my buddie 's juiceman juicer and my yield was approximately 30 greater cons as with any other similar juicer cleaning it gets old that 's probably the only think that keeps me from using it multiple times day	20

1	i had this vacuum for about a month the suction was so bad that after every room i had to empty what little dirt was in the canister just to get back some suction i hated it ! not only that but the bagless was a pain ! i had to go outside everytime to empty the dang thing because it was so messy ! not to mention that trying to get the canister out and back in was the hardest thing ever it made even more of a mess trying to get it out and in ! i did not want that in my house ! i absolutely hated this vacuum	20

1	i purchased this high end toaster oven because i wanted needed a proficient smaller oven for smaller baking needs after 5 months of moderate usage however the middle knob has malfunctioned and it will no longer bake other than that i was satisfied with the product i called their customer service and to get it repaired under warranty will have to ship it at least 250 miles away at my expense what a hassle i may just go buy a cheap toaster oven to replace it instead of spending the time and money on postage live and learn just because a product costs more does n't mean it 's better	20
0	i bought these as i was trying to find my pattern on the internet i love them ! they are great in the microwave and they match beautifully perfect for a small dish of ice cream or peaches or to put salsa in for snacking	20
1	i searched for what i thought would be a great dish rack this is without a doubt the worst product i have ever bought ! there is nothing stainless about this ! i have had it for only about 4 months and it is already rusting it was so not worth the money i paid for it i would not recommend buying this product	20
1	it seems that there is always something crappy in a good design the pot does a good job perking coffee but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot i think that melitta should send out for nothing the glass top i am like the other reviews i would not buy another melitta product unless they make good on this pot there is a danger of the top blowing out and melitta could be in for law suits	20

1	do n't waste your money or your food by buying and using this so called slow cooker just like most people have reported the unit runs very hot ! this is an indication of poor manufacturing quality control after a couple of burnt meals i went out and bought a different unit with a mechanical temperature control switch unfortunately i had thrown away the carton and receipt so i could n't return it as a result of this experience and wasting my good money i will avoid buying rival products in the future	20
0	i 've had one of these in constant use for four years now and it fulfills its reason for being admirably it is totally utilitarian and keeps my valued wusthof global and henckels knives organized out of sight protected and instantly accessable without taking up the whole drawer or using up valuable counter space as larger 'made mostly for show' blocks would if you 're looking for something simple and in its own way elegant this should serve you well for a long time if you have more knives than this will hold or if you have lots of counter space to waste get something larger that 's just my opinion i could be wrong	20
1	this did n't do as well as an old microwve poper i 've used for yers it did n't showa great increase in kernals popped and they were not as light and crispy it is absolutely necessary to use the 'power packs' which i could n't find in local stores since i gave several of the poppers as gifts i shopped on line for replacement 'power packs' for all and found the postage handling fee for 10 packages was ten times what it cost for one \( incredibly light \) pack	20
0	we had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves \( and we know our directionals here \) so if you get it just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up	21
0	stainless steel bars will last longer than plain enamel metal bars which lasted a ling time in all kinds of weather since we leave our weber grill outside all year cookung results seem to be the same	21
0	i love this clock i wanted a small clock for my bedroom and did n't realize it projected when i bought it \( was an impluse purchase when buying a dvd player \) i ca n't live without it now i am nearsighted so this is great in the dark i have given four as gifts \( that 's what i'm buying today \) and i find that when i go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling ! i will always have a projection clock from now on i could n't live without it	21
0	the best sprouter i 've found does a great job of growing sprouts but very overpriced for its cheap quailty and build	21
0	this is the greatest cleaning system i 've seen it 's sturdy and i can reach to the top of my cathedral ceilings easily the ceiling fan attachement is great a couple of swipes with this attachement and it 's clean no more standing on a step ladder trying to reach the fan blades	21
0	so it 's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out right \? well yes it is as i get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming the fact that i can have one device that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me it 's just a clock but it works which is more than i can say for my fax or copier or phone or i always get lacross because i like the looks of their stuff be good to yourself upgrade to atomic	21
1	how can someone use this for cooking \? \? \? the instructions about keeping it for do n't know how long in the oven to start working outrageus either i do n't know to use dutch ovens or all the previous reviews are written by the sellers	21
0	just from looking at the picture i can tell that this chair is made from redwood and is constructed with quot mortice and tennon quot joints a very solid method of construction my only hesitation is that there are no measurements given plus if the chair and chair back slats are n't thick enough they will be prone to spliting	21
0	this item was the perfect addition to the tool box grill that was bought as a gift for my son he loves i	21
0	the table arrived within a few days and well packed it was easy to put together took me about 10 minutes one of the best instructions and labeling of parts i have ever seen even a little bottle with paint for touch ups the table is just like described and is of good quality it has a bronze brown finish and looks great with the strathwood deep seating chairs i ordered earlier definetly would buy this again	21
1	this product to my knowledge is completely untested i suspect it because it says it requires no boiling which sugestes that it may contain a preservative yeast and or bacterial inhibitor this could not possibly be good for the hummers listen to the experts such as sheri wlliamson \( peterson 's hummingbirds of north america \) sugar and water is just fine filtered water best but not distilled	21
0	i am thrilled with this purchase i had initially ordered 4 chairs and the companion dining table upon its delivery i went back and ordered another pair of chairs they are very comfortable generously proportioned their overall styling very beautiful to the eye i have subsequently received many compliments on this set i just wish they sold a larger matching table i plan on ordering the companion loveseat	21
0	used it tonight for the first time made 5 pizzas with an average cook time 8 minutes bottom was a golden brown with very even cooking a very good simple design faster than a real brick oven bob pratl gloucester mass	21
1	when i bought this product it was said to be new ! however upon opening the package it arrived in the cooker was in an already opened inner box i though that perhaps someone just opened the inner box to check the item before it was sent \? as i opened the inner box one of the legs on the cooker was broken off and rusted ! i needed to use this right away so i did not send it back now i will have to get this leg welded back on ! beware of the new designation !	21
1	the clock was off by 4 hours even after so called rebooting i called tech support and they requested me to send the clock back to them at my cost so that they can pop the hands off and advance it four hours they should have replaced it for free but they did not i just think this clock is just a big hoax	21
1	what a joke not worth the money i put it in the container to pull out the oil and it dies half way through swapped batteries pulled it out washed it and looked at all the parts it was either used and resold to me by amazon or it was defective from the start and since they have a 30 day return policy i am now stuck with it i will see what eastman says next very disappointing i will go back to the old way of just pouring it into a funnel with a coffee filter in it	21
0	this chaise lounge made for the perfect addition to my deck the cushion is durable thick and extremely comfortable with velcro 'ties' to keep the cushion in place \( from sliding \) it truly is a beautiful piece there was a slight mix up with the shipping but once everything was straightened out the lounger was delivered just as scheduled the delivery guys even brought the box around to my backyard and on to my deck the chair comes completely assembled all you do is open the box and enjoy	21
0	just got my thermometer love it i just put the batteries in and it started working ! my kind of item there are other things that can be captured but all i want is to know when it is 12 degrees out love being able to bring it around the house	21

0	i keep seeing this companies outdoor furniture am tempted to buy but wish someone who 's purchased some would post on how it weathers my porch is uncovered so weathering could be a problem thanks	21
1	after charging the batteries 1 of the 2000 mah batteries only had a capacity of 400 mah this means the whole 4 pack is no good	21
0	we have had it on our patio for about 4 months and it works great the numbers are clear enoungh to see from our pool area	21
0	this platter is suitable for serving a main entree as it is bigger than the average plate metal insert comes out easily for cleaning have owned it for over a year and it has been durable no complaints	21
0	this bbq tool set is absolutely the top of the line and worth much more than i paid for it ! all the tools are heavy wood with rubber grips and heavy stainless steel even the case is made to hold up for a long time i was truly impressed when i received it	21
0	i have been buying plastic hummingbird feeders that attach to the window so i can have an up close view of my favorite birds i found this wonderful glass feeder that will not deteriorate and get brittle \( i had to replace the plastic ones every year \) i was concerned that it would be too heavy but the suction cups are very effective and the feeder was accepted immediately by all the hummingbirds right now there is snow on the ground temperatures below freezing at night and i still have a faithful hummer visiting every day when it gets warm enough for him \( her \? \) to move around great product	21
0	i was really pleased with the quality of this patio table it was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering as others have commented the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table i ordered i had to buy additional screws at home depot four in total the missing instructions for the table ordered were not really needed it was simple enough to put together without instructions all tools needed were included with the shipment had i not needed to purchase additional screws i would have given this product 5 stars	21
0	i am quite pleased with my lunchbox it is the perfect size yet is not obtrusive in design shape or capacity i would recommend to others	21
0	this is a great watch for people who are trying their hand at outdoor sports it is easy to use and not too bulky wish is was made of a more durable material other than plastic but like i mentioned it is great for a beginner to practice it has all of the main functions of watches costing much more so it does the job it is a very clean and smart looking watch	21
1	one of the most important features that should be told is how far down the ground a metal detector can detect both coin size and large items i'm annoyed with this and many other metal detector 's descriptions which refuses to mention this more than important point i'm shopping for my boyfriend and just because of all the annoyance i may just give up and get him a 10 tie for his birthday	21
1	this is the second weber mitt that i 've tried they both burned through within two weeks there are other heavier duty mitts avaiable that will last a lot longer	21
1	do n't let the size of the box fool you even though this item comes packaged in a good sized box this product is barely one inch by two inches it 's just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it although it does seem to attract flies for a few days it does n't seem to last for very long at all it 's just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic ! in my opinion it 's just not worth it	21
1	i was looking forward to purchasing this item until i got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost the cheapest shipping would run me 14 99 for an item costing 21 89 sorry weatherbuffs you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price	21
0	america 's test kitchen rated it number one so i decided to try one for myself i have owned grill brushes from home depot online catalog sellers etceteras the bristles regardless of material on these brushes end up shedding over time or if not they crush down and become nearly worthless the grill wizard eliminates these problems by using a replaceable pad the pad works great i'm still on my first pad and have used it probably 10 times or more already it 's a good product and i highly recommend it	21
0	price was right for the grill piece only drawback is no real grill location to use it	21
0	i got one of these loungers as a gift this past christmas as soon as i put it on the deck everyone wanted to use this chair so i got online and found another so we can share it is more comfortable than any chair in our house	21

0	it is a great umbrella very straight forward to put together and easy to use	21
0	the drawback is you ca n't grill at the same time you use the rotisserie but it works wonderfully ! delicious	21
0	weber discontinued it and amazon no longer has it my pal has a condo with a balcony \( not large \) this is the weber for her equip it with one charcoal rail and you get lots of indirect heat for smoking usually the 14 inch smokey joe 's are too small often my 22 inch performer is too big but this jumbo joe is just right weber bring it back ! !	21
1	bought the driveway patrol and had nothing but problems with it it constantly went off no matter how many times i moved it around also when a car drove into the driveway sometimes it would n't go off ! ! ! talked to the telebrands people and after having to pay shipping to send the first one back they replaced it free however it worked just as bad as the first one now they refuse to refund my money ! ! this product is an absolute ripoff and i would n't recommend it to my worst enemy i agree with the other review that they would give it a minus 10 stars ! ! i suggest you beware of any other products you might want from telebrands	21
0	cooks illustrated rated this product the best and so do i i purchased two as gifts one for my husband and one for my son in law for fathers day both are extreamly pleased with the product	21
0	we bought this for use at a beach house the grills provided at the houses are always dreadful it worked perfectly to grill shrimp hamburgers and hot dogs it is easy to transport and easy to use with very little assembly required	21
0	this is a product i was not sure about just from seeing the picture once it arrived i was very pleased with my choice the picture does n't do it justice it is very sturdy and the rubber grip helps too ! ! ! great gift for a man or woman that loves to grill	21
1	i ordered two of these sets and was not sent what is described there is no large aluminum basket and no fish fry basket included the description says it is professional grade but i received commercial grade customer service has offered to send me out a replacement but i am assuming the same thing will happen again it seems as if amazon attached the wrong picture and description to this item beware if you want everything that is listed that's not what you will get	21
1	i agree with the other reviewer buy flowtron instead my flowtron 40c lasted 20 years with the same bulb and never had a clogging problem with bugs for the same price the flowtron 40d is a much better buy	21
0	we purchased this grill to take with us when we go camping it is small and does not take up too much room however you can fit a lot of food on it this is a great weber product	21
1	i am sorry i bought this thing it 's way too complicated to set up and yes i read the instructions they only added to my frustration i would not recommend this product at all and will think 3 times before purchasing anything else from this manufacturer	21
1	i spent the extra on this alarm because i wanted a projection feature the projection feature lasted 2 weeks i also had a wall clock made by lacrosse that does not accurately reflect either the temperature or the humidity save your money folks hopefully amazon will refund my	21
0	i purchased this item for the offic gift exchange the golfers went crazy for it we have the kind of exchange where you can steal someone else 's gift and this bbq set really made the rounds ! nice quality and is bigger than it looks in the picture	21
0	plain and simple very effective i plugged this device in to the wall in my office in a school within seconds the roaches in our kitchen area ran into the hallway they have not been seen since there have not been any mouse droppings around either	21
0	the cooker is very versitile we used it in the last week for a fish fry and then a low country boil the product works fantastic	21
0	we bought this clock to use indoors living in florida our power service is n't always reliable especially during hurricane season so having a battery operated atomic clock is perfect for us ! when folks visit they always comment on how nice the clock looks the bronze finish is muted and it does n't clash too badly with the muted silver finish on most of our fixtures and for 45 and no shipping we could n't beat the price on ebay overstock com or any onther online companies in other words we 're very pleased with our purchase	21
0	i bought this item based upon the reviews i read and i must say it lived up to the reviews it did the job i bought this late in the summer but the one time i used it i was impressed by the amount of bugs that it zapped in a short space of time i saw and felt the effectiveness of the product because i stayed in the backyard longer than usual	21
1	the name on this item should be pillow it is much too small for a cushion they need to change the discription to pillow or cushion for your head i wish i had spent more time reading the whole page on this item before i ordered it lesson learned	21
0	i love this clock ! it 's big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it 's sheltered from the rain that 's about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles	21
1	this hummingbird feeder looked like a good idea until i filled it \( following the direction \) and put it up on the window and it fell off 15 seconds later and the glass busted	21
0	after a few years of use the original rack on my gold c grill was rusty and unusable this is the exact replacement and fits like the original making the grill that much more usuable again	21
0	i ordered this to go along with the teak lounge chair and both of them turned out to be a great deal only took one day to arizona and so far no color change from the every day sun	21
0	great value sure case could be metal instead of polymer but for the price the capabilities of the watch ca n't be beat very intuitive interface and easy to use compares favorably to watches costing 3 4 times as much	21
1	very disappointed with this item only two of the eight lights work and they only stay on for about an hour there 's plenty of sunshine here in new mexico to charge them up but they still do n't work and are just plain worthless	21
0	i did a lot of research and if you follow directions it is safe and fun it takes about 25 min to heat the oil and 45 minutes to cook an 11 lb turkey the pot has a maximum oil level mark and that was the correct amount for our bird the turkey must be dried well to prevent spattering watch the oil temp so it does not go over 350 do it outdoors as the paint has to burn off the burners and it smells	21
0	this thing works great i prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so i never had a chance to make beer can chicken the chicken i cooked came out perfect crispy skin and juicy inside excellent ! i'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time the bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean highly recommended	21
1	do n't waste your money \( even just 10 bucks \) the plastic is not rip stop and tears very easily i will now just use a big heavy duty black trash can liner they are much stronger	21
1	i got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look after eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke we are not overweight people \( 140 190lb \) very sad that we have to replace them because we were happy with appearance	21
0	needs to be near a window to get the time signal	21
0	i have two of these one in my bedroom and one outside they work great i also have one simular to this one except it has a 4 ft external temp sensing wire that can be used for a pool or freezer i use mine in a freezer in my shed 150 ft away all three send a signal back to a small base unit in my living room that i monitor daily i lost power to my shed last week if not for the temp sensor in the freezer reading 20 degrees i probably would have had a lot of food spoil if these sensors ever go bad i will get new units	21
0	we have a brinkmann 810 7080 7 gourmet electric smoker grill and when using it the first time we were really impressed with the end product pork spareribs we put a dry rub on the ribs including 1 mccormick grill mates mesquite2 garlic salt3 onion salt4 lemon pepperwe put blocks of hickery wood around the electric coil in the bottom of the smoker we are not sure if the ribs had either a mesquite or hickkery smoke flavor but they were outstanding	21
0	i am using the product for my charbroil grill caddy it is a decent fit however with the colder weather the material has become more stiff we 'll have to see how it weathers over the cold months	21
0	the product work perfectly and the displays are very good beaufiful and modern design	21
0	this was the ideal instrument for us we like to walk in the early morning when the temperature outside is above 40 degrees ! the projected time and temperature tell us whether we need to get out of bed or can sleep in a little longer the weather forecasting feature is also useful and at least as accurate as the tv forecasts	21
0	i use this bbq with mesquite lump charcoal and have grilled excellent steaks and smoked some pork ribs a chicken a london broil and a giant hamburger so far no marinade just a dry rub and on the grill the book included has accurate cook times as long as you keep the temperature needle on the i in ideal for as much of the cook time as possible which is not hard to do make sure to cure it before you use it this burns off all the smells and chemicals that are in it from the manufacturing cure it using the propane burner easy to assemble too	21
0	just to make sure people do n't make the same mistake i did be aware that this is not compatible with the weber q 200 silver portable propane gas grill amazon com lists this rotisserie as an accessory for the weber q 200 so it is amazon that deserves a low rating so i have just given this the current average of 4 stars	21
0	i 've had much fun using the rotisserie and my first attempts a turkey and a pork roast were quite good ! i anticipate excellent results as i gain experience one caveat it does n't make sense to buy this unless you plan to cook 10 15 lb roasts the instruction booklet does n't provide much in the way of cooking guidance or recipes but there 's lots of both on the internet i suspect that using a rotisserie is easier w a gas grill but i 've been using charcoal for many many years and that 's that	21
0	exactly the same as the original grates that came with the bbq arrived fast and packed well	21
0	i have one of these this one is for my sister 's motorhome it makes a great little game or card table eating doing a small craft table folds up nicely and has a height adjustment	21
0	love it ! ! ! projection of time in soft red light in numbers that are easily read without glasses extremely non invasive light especially enjoy feature of two separate alarms very accurate temperature readings of both indoor and outside temperatures well worth the money ! ! !	21
0	i agree completely with the other reviewer well packaged easy to put together very sturdy way better quality than those you see at outdoor concept stores i mainly ordered it b c i knew it would be the right size to go w the strathwood chaise lounges i ordered i am very happy with it	21
1	i bought one of the custom tile 7 's \( loaded with options \) from california and was able to use it for less than a year before it started to self destruct i tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years until they skipped to mexico tiles just did n't fall off they spalted the fire box broke etc when it got too bad to use and look at we had to throw it away a 1500 mistake if there was a really good ceramic cooker out there i would try it again they cook like a dream	21
0	man what a awesome weber item it cooked the chicken so well and for clean up was a charm i think im planning to buy another to cook two birds at once	21
0	this is a great fire pit for the money it is deep and secure no fear of the fire getting loose it also doubles as a bbq great buy for the money	21
0	high quality well constructed cooker delivery was quick we are very pleased with our purchase	21
0	i always recommend the oxo line of tools to anyone that does a lot of cooking and wants something really designed for use this is especially true for anyone with problems such as tendonitis arthritis or carpal tunnel these tools are all designed to leverage energy efficiently instead of wasting energy as most poorly designed utensils try them out	21
1	color shown as natural is far from accurate i am unhappy with color and may return these	21
1	i was hoping it would repel roaches a common problem in nyc but this thing absolutely does nothing ! ! in the two weeks i used it three bugs wondered into my place in the vicinity of this pest repeller besides you can hear the ticking noise of this device very well like a clock	21
0	had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms \? try this one ! very nice design looks great simulated wood finish pole easy open and close we are very satisfied	21
0	i love this clock ! it 's big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it 's sheltered from the rain that 's about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles	21
0	the price was right the bench was larger than i expected which was a nice thing it went together easily and works great the company does not list measurements on the amazon web site and i think they would sell more of them through amazon if they did	21
0	it 's easy to carry every where we g	21
0	we own a home with vaulted ceilings and we have tried everything to keep the house clean \( cobwebs ceiling fans windows etc \) that are out of reach we found this product online and it works great our kids even enjoy using it around the house each attachment is perfect for the task at hand i wish we bought it five years ago	21

0	we got the clock read the instructions installed a battery and hung it on an east west wall after the sun went down the clock was able to receive the station and set itself to the correct time it has worked flawlessly for the last two months since we got it it 's nice to have the correct time all the time and the kids do n't worry about getting out on time to catch the bus because the clock is off	21
0	this is my second bug zapper took another brand back that did n't work this zapper is working great and that 's all thanks to its intelligent design some bug zappers have super small entry holes and then wimpy little electrodes inside this zapper is designed to let bugs fly in easily and it has vertical electrodes that zap bugs this zapper works really well in fact the other night it was zapping like crazy because it was hot and the bugs were out we live in an urban area near a plant nursery so we 'd always have bugs coming in the back door now this zapper kills them and attracts them away from our backdoor great product	21
0	i bought this for my husband in december we put it in december 25 \( we have an acre for our back yard \) with about 40 mole holes the ground has been freezing on and off and we put one in the middle of an old hole takes 3 d batteries and believe it or not the thing is still vibrating \( sounds kind of irritating if your close \) but who cares beats the back yard looking like a new cemetery no new holes you could chew more juicy fruit which the kids love to help out with for our small front yard but that only lasts you about 3 weeks i m buying another for the front yard	21
0	i checked multiple sites and manufacturers for this type of product we are totally pleased with what we received the construction and fabric are all that we could have wanted at much more cost	21
1	i received this watch as a gift after reviewing several others the display is very good the altimiter is usually way off and varies greatly even remaining in the same position it is a little difficult to make use of all the watch 's features i am very concerned the watch is stamped on the back water resistant but new reports are showing it is not in fact if it is not we have been misled by the manufacturer overall i can not recommend this watc	21
0	i am impressed with this product all the parts were clearly marked all the parts were included in the box the directions were excellent no complaints here	21
0	i found the 16 lacrosse atomic clock to be exactly as described the metal case is sturdy and good looking the directions very straight forward 16 is big be sure you want this diameter they make smaller units i am quite satisfied with my purchase	21
0	we received this as a christmas gift and have come to dependon it daily for time and weather it displays accurate time temperature and weather tendency using rising or fallingpressure it does not display actual pressure numbers onlyindicating rising or falling pressure outside temp and pressure info is transmitted wirelessly from a small unit mounted outside and has a range of about 200 feet quality of the unit is good and i would recommend to anyone wanting to have an accurate time standard to which all clocks and watches could be set	21
0	i like oregon scientific products but their previous atomic alarms had quirky controls often leading to changing the time zone in the middle of the night rather than turning off the alarm this one 's lots better ! the projection feature works ok though does n't really focus sharply at the close distances i 'd prefer to use the eight minute snooze alarm is great just the right interval ! overall a nice useful moderately expensive alarm clock	21
1	i purchased this particular clock because it was described as an outdoor clock upon receipt of the clock i read the instruction book and under the section entitled frequently asked questions is the following q can a la cross technology clock be used outdoors \? a yes but only in a dry environment and in a temperature range between 41 f andd 131 f this clock is not water resistant living in new england we do get rain and snow and the temperature is frequently below 41 f the clock has a very misleading description	21
1	you have heard the old expression that if it sounds too good to be true it probably is \? this product is proof of that i really wanted to avoid poison and traps so i thought i would try this p o s to solve my gopher problem humanely sure i was skeptical but some buyers reported success after 4 weeks i can report that my gophers are utterly and completely indifferent to this product i noticed some buyers experienced a surge in activity but i have seen nothing nada zip numerous fat happy gophers before numerous fat happy gophers after caveat emptor	21
0	protecting your grill is important if you leave it outside all the time this is by far the best grill cover we have had it is easy to put over the grill the velcro straps keep it from flying off it fits the genesis s 320 perfectly and it is heavyweight recommended definitely	21
0	we bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale after longing for the full priced versions at stores we love these chairs but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them one of the chairs broke recently b c of the cords fraying over time the good news is that i easily ordered replacement cords online by just searching on google for lafuma replacement cords and for 19 i will have a like new chair again \( rather than replacing the chair for 150 \) so for those of you worried about the durability feature of the cording worry no more	21
0	i have had this smoker for about 8 years as i live on the east coast of florida it has been subjected to a great many adverse conditions sun rain heat salt air and the occasional 150 mph sandblasting the only degradation that it has experienced was that the 2 legs \( without the wheels \) need replacing due to rusting off at the bottom and the grills had to be replaced maintenance is a snap just regular cleaning and an occasional coat of oven black she may not be the youngest lady at the ball but she still makes the best ribs chicken and steak	21
1	a major concept of an atomic clock to me meant i would not have to reset it for dst other clocks in my home took care of it i waited two weeks and this clock did not i ca n't trust if for the true time so i am sorry i purchased it	21
0	i bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area it creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports the cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles the sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm	21
0	traditional grill brushes quickly clog with grill funk and the wires bend thus rendering them useless in a short time this has a pad that fits any grill and they can be removed and washed \( or replaced \) rated number one grill brush according to america 's test kitchen	21
0	receive the item very quickly eventhough i selected the free shipping method product is manufactured by weber in the original carton not a look alike item manufactured somewhere by someone you have never heard of before	21
1	item was not new and arrived with dents scratches gouges and jammed doors returne	21
1	these mitts are good quality problem is that the thumbs are way to short and narrow rendering these mitts virtually useless do yourself a favor and go to a store where you can try stuff like this before you buy	21
0	this is a great clock looks good makes no noise and very easy to read setup should be simple but i would suggest adding a button to change from manual to automatic you usually do n't get the clock at midnight and you want to setup it right from the beginning since it 's not going to be able to sync early in the afternoon you want to set the time manually and leave the clock to sync at night but this is where an additional button comes in handy cause moving the hands is done with the same button and its hard to know if the clock was left on automatic or not	21
0	we are pleased with our recent purchase we were surprised that it came through the us mail service it did have a broken part that we believe is used on the cord to open the umbrella	21
0	i 've been looking for an atomic clock with functions and design i finally found it with the 8249 the large display is very nice all info are logically located on the display one quick glance and i know the time indoor outdoor temp humidity day date and month the clock update itself about 2 to 3 times a day i ca n't really ask for more than this especially the price on amazon was really good	21
0	like all weber products i have owned this brush does an excellent job	21
0	this upgrade is worth every penny i agree with the reviewer that felt that heating was more even i would add that they seem to burn the drippings off better and keep the inside of the grill cleaner there is no doubt in my mind that the addition of this product makes the original design all the better	21
0	this is an excellent product sturdier than most and very comfortable i like the back straps for carrying purposes would be nicer if it would recline fully	21
1	the price for the item is reasonable the quality of the item is excellent the shipping costs are n't displayed on the selling page the shipping costs are more than the cost of the item do not buy with one clic	21
0	this is a very good working metal detector i 'd recamend it to anyone who is looking in to buy it	21
0	this is a good product i'm very happy with the atachments the squgee works real well its hard to find a good one with treads to screw onto a extention pole the pole should extend to 15 feet its only 10 feet long fully extended but nice and short to carry around in and out of viechels i would order this product just for the attachment	21
0	we bought this for thanksgiving but found ourselves using it more often than just once a year easy to setup and great to use	21
0	this firepit is the perfect size for a small patio its sturdy construction will hold up to many summers gathered around the fire the glow is enhanced by the moon and stars cut outs making for a special evening event	21
0	i have had mine for 4 years and it has worked out great the main difference between this offset barbecue and more expensive ones is the lack of complete air control there are simply too many open seams to allow in air so it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at 215f that said with a bit of patience and practice you can make excellent barbecue on this thing the metal gauge is heavy enough to last you several years \( though eventually the firebox will burn out \)	21
1	i like everything about the thermometer except its most important feature the outside temperature is too strongly influenced by the inside temperature ok so i have it installed at my place in the mountains where the difference at night on the inside outside termperatures can be forty degrees or more many mornings i check this thermometer with two other outside thermometers and find the other two may read for example 15 degrees and this one will read 35 degrees it will be 60 degrees inside my window is double paned but that still does not insulate sufficiently to produce unreliable outside readings when not window mounted and placed by other thermometers the readings are acceptable and consistent	21
0	i bought this unit 4 years ago it has performed flawlessly i'm still amazed at how often the rain prediction turns out to be correct it 's hitting about 90 accuracy on rain within 36 hours better than the weather dude on television	21
0	this is a very nice cover it is heavy duty and vented at the rear of the top others say this cover fits tight and it does but i can get it on and off by myself the trick is since the cover is a little stiff you can hold it with one hand above the grill while you use your other hand to guide it on to the grill then it slides down and fits properly it looks awesome really sets my grill apart from my neighbors' unkept grills ! \)	21
0	i put the sensor out my backdoor in a shady area about 30 feet from the main unit in the kitchen one screw attaches each item it has three channels it 'll memorize the high and low indoor and outdoor temperature the display is large enough to read from several feet away it 's been installed for several months of silent dependable and accurate temperature monitoring	21
1	i purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable when you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive if any water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys i am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai	21
0	ca n't say too much for a replacement ignitor system but it works it installed as easily as expected and appeared to be of a slightly better quality than the part that it replaced if the previous part is any indication it should last about 5 7 years hard to believe in this time of designed obsolesence	21
1	i recently bought the stinger uv15 it worked well for one month ! in that month i followed the recommendations for cleaning it and keeping it clear of dead bugs well just shy one month and the grid has completely failed so it attracts the bugs but does n't kill them this product is not worth the money	21
0	the brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then the brush has a strong wooden handle leather loop a sturdy set of bristles and a grill scraper for tough jobs be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12 inch one does not have the reach especially for larger grills	21
0	purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews i have found the basket to work great you put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces very easy with rock cornish game hens though i needed to tie them a little bit but that is because the little legs are well little never had one before just the skewer kind cleans fairly easy too love it	21
0	very satisfied with the performance of this meter have been looking for a relative humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable the temperature is also included which is great price is very good for what you get ! !	21
1	the cover that i received was much shorter than pictured someone else had the same problem i sent it back it seemed pointless i am using my old weber cover it does n't look real pretty but it provides outdoor protection which is the point	21
1	i normally bbq 8 9 racks of ribs at once for our annual party thought that this weber rib rack would make it easier however i found that it was more of a hinderance than a help i like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce several times so i have to remove them from the rack for basting getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain if you 're going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook then it might be useful but that 's not me so i gave my weber rib rack to my brother in law	21
1	there oughta be a law i can utterly guarantee that this thing wo n't work i was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years we used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time \( it 's usually nice toasty warm in there \) sanitation exclusion and very careful application of pesticides is what you need rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time but quickly adapt \( adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best \) again count on sanitation exclusion and traps try to avoid baits because you 'd rather know where the little s o b died \( i e in a trap rather than in a wall somewhere \)	21
0	got this on ebay for 150 00 it was barely used give me a high five	21
0	the bench is easy to assemble and lid actuallydoes work well it is not an item that will lastforever but it is priced fairly for what it is a storagebench	21
0	we were so excited about getting this fire pit rightly so it 's great we could n't ask for more ! adding wood is a breeze it radiates heat well was very easy to put together so far has n't shown any rust at all \( although we do expect it to eventually \)	21
0	this is our first fire pit and it seems to work great it is not too heavy so it can be moved around our patio and it looks nice the only downside and i think this is true of all firepits is that the bowl fills up with water when it rains and makes quite a mess in there i find myself cleaning the bowl more often than i 'd like but otherwise is a great	21
1	the grill is up to webers usual high standards but i do have a couple of quibbles with it i bought the q grill because i needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv since every pound counts the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel but an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface i do n't have the time nor inclination to season a cast iron grill what i would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface	21
0	i love it ! it 's a bit of work to maintain but it 's an awesome grill that cooks everything \( once i figured out how to cook and got a good grill cook book \) i bought two propane cylinders and just swap them out when the gauge that they hang on says it 's a at a quarter tank it 's worth the price	21
0	besides that outdoor temperature and relative humidity i use the base station inside along with three remote wireless monitors to measure temperature and humidty in my crawlspace attic and outdoors to monitor possible water intrusion issues and if there are freezing temperature concerns for the pipes during cold weather periods	21
0	i am using this clock indoors very nice looks and large enough to use on a big wall without looking cheap the main concern i had before getting this was the battery life i have heard bad stories about some atomic clocks using up a battery \( s \) in as little as 30 45 days but since receiving this 3 months ago it 's still going strong on the first charge of the rechargeable battery i put in i really like the fact that i can easily tell what time it is from across the room and down the hall without my glasses even being pretty badly near sighted	21
0	someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag it is not it is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time	21
0	while we 've used coleman folding stoves for years if you have trunk space there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill the small tank makes this practical for camping if you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available this is a great choice for camping equipment we still like the coleman for boiling water but i love barbecuing on a propane grill like this	21
0	i have a high ceiling so the display of the time was fuzzy and i missed the see through case with the red night light on the earlier model but overall i was satisfied with the clock	21
0	my grill is n't a webber but i was still able to get it installed by cutting the top of the metal covering the electrode to make room for the burners lights the grill everytime	21
0	this wonderful hammock continues to offer my family a much needed break from gardening raking or playing with the kids the kids love to pile in and spin until they are dizzy while i enjoy a much needed break and read a favorite book	21
0	this is the best outdoor cooking item i have ever used it has very high btu 's and cooks very quickly when using it as a wok it takes the grease out of the kitchen that used to linger for days we cook all greasy foods outdoors it is extremely fast and the food comes excellent we use it more than out bbq	21
0	this garden bench is very well made and extremely attractive the color is elegant i have it in a small sun room and it is perfect the cushion fabric is sturdy enough to withstand my dogs but the cushion itself could be heftier the bench is lightweight giving the impression it is not solid and sturdy but has supported whatever i have subjected it to and i have 10 dogs that love a couch ! i would give it 5 stars if the cushion were made of a better foam	21
1	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
1	i was looking forward to purchasing this item until i got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost the cheapest shipping would run me 14 99 for an item costing 21 89 sorry weatherbuffs you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price	21
0	these are a big improvement over the porcelin ones the food seemed to cook faster and tasted better they were heavier than i thought they would be and was a perfect fit for my silver b	21
0	this clock is very simple and clean i had no problem getting mine to work i had to leave it overnight to get the signal and they all set one has walls blocking the western direction and it sometimes loses the signal so i just leave it out overnight at a better location and put it back overall i really like this clock	21
0	i hate to admit but we have roaches ! actually we had roaches until last week when i purchased this product i had tried everything sprays bombs traps etc but nothing worked the first day i plugged this little device in there was such a great increase in bug activity that my kids would n't go into the kitchen by day 3 the roaches were gone ! i do n't know where they went and i do n't care this device saved my sanity	21
0	i got this grill last year as a father 's day gift i 'd never smoked any meat in my life but have been a grill man for a looong time this smoker makes it easy i 've done ribs brisquet pork steaks chicken all turned out great that brisquet especially ! make sure you cure the inside of the grill before cooking anything in it there are instructions in the box also if your model does n't come with the built in thermometer make sure you order one from the char broil website using a standard oven thermometer wastes time and precious heat	21
0	this product is great for the following reasons 1 stability \( your chicken wo n't fall over during the cooking process as with just a standard can \) 2 quality is wonderful \( not flimsy and cheap \) 3 dishwasher safe \( easy to clean \) 4 not too big \( so that it takes up the whole grill \) 5 priced well compared to other similiar products6 no worries where the can has been and what inks might come of	21
1	i purchased this product in may 2006 however it is not working this year april 2007 i replaced the 40 watt bulb but it still does not work this is not a product worth the expense i would say that for less that 11 months of use 8 00 would be a high enough price to pay	21
1	i have two units and two sensors i thought they would all be compatible i just received this sensor yesterday and find it works alone but is n't compatible with my units i wish i had checked this out more carefully before i purchased it	21
1	after twice sending the unit back to the factory the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on i tried all the suggestions made by the factory the following year i opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong i found totally frozen fan bearings i suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings to end my agonies with the unit i took it to the garbage dump the unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable when it worked it worked well i believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito	21
1	i bought this in january and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around now it is an hour off \( one hour less than it should be \) and wo n't reset to daylight savings time there is a button that resets it if you do n't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall no reply from the manufacturer beautiful clock but useless half the year	21
0	excellent service ontime delivery perfect match for my grill thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell	21

1	way to small of a cushion had to purchase another one from a local store	21
0	i bought this item as a gift for my dad i was unable to get the atomic clock to self set but we live just outside of a large city and i 've heard this can cause some issues in any event my dad loves the crescendo alarm feature \( as he gets up at 4 30 am \) and the projection feature everything else works fine and i would recommend this item perhaps if i played with the atomic clock a bit more i could get it to self set	21
0	product is a must for bbq buffs have nothing but good things to say re amazon merchants	21
0	you ca n't go wrong buying this great grill it was a snap to put together with easy to follow instructions it heats up super fast and cooks with wonderful efficency no cold spots as far as i can tell so far on any parts of the cooking surface and flame ups are kept to a minimum you wo n't be dissapointed if you bring this baby home	21
0	cushions look great on chaise loungers bright dark green in color cushion get very hot in the sun items arrive well boxed and well before promised date	21
0	i purchased this prep station for my yard it is the nicest prep table i have seen for the price it is durable while still nice looking delivery was on time i did have a problem that some parts were missing from the box but they were replaced free of charge from the merchant	21
0	i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges \( 2 \) they would only be temporary until i could afford good ones because they were so inexpensive well these are good and i do n't need to replace them the design actually matches my table set and i did n't even realize it until we unpacked them fully assemled ! i only have one complaint and it 's really not that bad the thickness of the cushion seems fine for me but my skinny butt husband tells me the cushions are n't cushiony enough other than that the chaises are absolutely wonderful and good quality	21
0	this is a great cleaning system for anyone with high walls or vaulted ceilings plus all the attachments make cleaning very versatile i looked at a similar system listed in the frontgate catalog and almost purchased it for more than 120 00 then i found this for less than 40 00 it 's great and i recommend it to anyone who likes to stay cobweb dust free	21
1	absolutely useless the three gizmos are in three small adjoining areas kitchen breakfast office areas the roaches come out at night and do a little dance to the clicks that the gizmos emit no effect whatsoever after 3 months	21
1	do n't waste your money \( even just 10 bucks \) the plastic is not rip stop and tears very easily i will now just use a big heavy duty black trash can liner they are much stronger	21
0	we purchased a new go anywhere charcoal grill to replace one exactly like it that has lasted 15 years with usage 3 4 times weekly the absolute best choice for perfection barbequing	21
0	i would recommend this product over to others no complaints	21
0	it 's designed in germany and mfgd in china i 'd say definitely locate and purchase the extension kit i did i have a large guatemalan hammock that i 've owned for years that 's barely seen any use usually on camping trips it finally occured to me to research and secure a hammock stand and it 's really delightful to be able to laze in the hammock in the shade of the house on summer afternoons i wish i 'd bought one of these years ago	21
0	i had purchased a brinkman electric smoker and needed some rib racks i looked around and found the cheapest price for these racks was from amazon \( which included free shipping since i purchased 2 racks \) i bought 6 racks of ribs cutting each rack in half they all arranged perfectly on the racks and we had some great ribs clean up was easy too all the grease came off and they are ready to use again good construction on the racks i definetly got my money 's worth on this product	21
0	this is truely a must have the flat non stick skewers holds everything in place they wo n't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for 7 39 a set but i checked here 1st and found them for 5 99 a set i ordered 5 sets ! ! the skewers are 14 long for plenty of food get yours today do n't wait get at least 2 sets	21
1	the turning weel is too small so the hose often falls off the stake is round and too short it wo n't stay in ground pretty much useless	21

1	these outdoor window thermometers seemed like a good idea however they 're worthless ! the lcd display is not bright like shown in the picture the numbers are so light they are totally unreadable also the suction cups will not stay stuck to a cold window i'm returning them	21
1	this grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear able the drawstring at it 's base is very easily prone to breaking i have bought and had to return this product twice already save yourself the trouble and look up market for something that you can depend on for a little longer than a single use	21
0	i was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product i need to point out i am 5'4 i did need the assistance from my boyfriend \( who is 6'1 \) to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs but he did it and they are gone ! i just received my simple clean today and i have already tried three attachments the ceiling fan attachment worked well i used the duster to dust my window panes in my foyer as well as my fragile lighting loved it ! we also used the spider web remover and it was great ! i recommend this product to everyone !	21

0	purchased this cover to protect my new weber q300 grill fits like a glove ! strong durable construction and superior protection	21
1	i was very disapointed with the smoker cover it is made of a very thin plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material this type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat weather and also some general scratching just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it the company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable sincerely yours allen vest iii	21
0	love to look up at the clock in the night without having to roll around to see a clock works great ! !	21
0	weber products are well made and the 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie is no exception the 'basket' style is a nice design	21

1	you should remove this merchant they have numerous complaints on multiple websites i ignored it and trusted amazon 's brand however my experience was horrible they over charged me and when i called to rectify the issue they were n't interested in trying to solve the problem but simply place blame on me then the service rep hung up on me i 'll never do business with them again	21
1	while the mitt is beautiful and the price is right it is narrow most mitts flare towards the opening this one does not i have larger forearms and it wo n't fit all the way up my husband has average sized arms and it wo n't go around his upper forearm either since they are so long they go almost to your elbow	21
0	we received one of these chairs as a gift from our daughter several years ago it has been a great conversation piece besides being a very comfortable chair the grandkids argue over who 's turn it is to use it it is very relaxing to sit in it on the patio on a nice summer evening and read or watch the sunset	21

0	these birdie hose reels are such a nice addition to my yard i bought two packs and have lined my front garden with them they are a very nice heavy weight and the overall detail is much more then i expected especially for this price i agree the stakes could have been an inch longer however i am having no issues with the size of my hose fitting into the track i am not sure what size hose the other customer is using it must be a professional grade hose ready for spring !	21
0	this hammock is made of soft cotton string it is extra large and very strong you need 13 foot span to hang it taunt which gives you enough room for the whole famil	21
0	when the time zone change happened earlier this year the clock worked like a champ and adjusted accordingly with the atomic clock the outdoor thermometer seems to give good temperature readings however i would never ever rely on the barometer to tell me if it 's cloudy or sunny it 's often wrong i also like the light projected readings of the clock it 's too bad that you ca n't set the clock itself to be readable in the dark which i prefer sometimes over the projection	21
1	i bought this thing to solve a problem and i have a new one i red the little manual trying to figure out how to have a projection and no way it does not stay in projection mode if you want to see the light projection you have to press the button i change the battery i left the clock for 26 minute before to change the paramenters and no way i wil buy one more expensive but one that work the projection of course i do not recogmend it	21

0	well sometimes it pays to take a chance after reading a negative review of these tongs i went ahead and bought them anyway i do love steven raichlen 's show and his books well either i have a disagreement with the earlier review or they fixed 'em these tongs work great are very heavy duty for handling big slabs of meat like i like to cook and the extra length keeps my hands cool without gloves i vote 5 stars keep on bbq'ing	21
1	how do you expect someone to purchase this item if they do n't know its dimensions please get with the program ! !	21
1	i have had this smoker since august and have a total of 20 hours smoking on it i noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after 4 hours of use and by hour 20 it was gone rendering the smoker useless the other problem i have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed dealing with charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless at the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered i would pass for something better	21
0	i bought my genisis silver a six years ago despite some abuse by me \( not covering it when it is raining ignoring grease fires while watching tv not cleaning it regularly not replacing the flavorizer bars \) it still is going strong and continues to produces the most delicious burgers steaks and grilled chicken ever i'm really glad i invested in the weber and not in a cheaper brand the size for me is perfect you can fit a lot of meat on this grill	21
0	weber products are well made and the 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie is no exception the 'basket' style is a nice design	21
0	works great switched from the old quick release to the new design \( which seems to be the only thing they carry nowadays !	21
0	this is a sturdy and attractive solution to my patio umbrella problem	21
0	been using the weather station for a few months now and am pretty satisfied with it temperatures agree okay and humidity is within the accuracy specified by lacrosse the display is a bit busy so i occasionally have trouble finding the information i want quickly	21
0	what a great piece of equipment elegant in its simplicity seems very sturdy easy to assemble if you organize first ! offers many cooking options well made great price wonderful brisket ca n't wait till thanksgiving smoked turkey yum ! have it covered in yard but will use year round	21
0	this cover works very nicely with my grill it fits well and appears to be fairly good grade material i have no complaints	21
0	i got this to go with my new silver b weber and i had the best chicken and ribs that i 've had in a very very long time it is extremely simple to assemble operate and most importantly to clean i 've had two different rotisserie ovens that i dreaded to use based on the cleaning factor alone cleaning this is quick and easy the small parts get clean by simply placing in hot soapy water in the sink i plan on using this a lot	21
0	i bought this for my bf for a christmas gift he likes to bbq on a little propane grill i guess i should have read the measurements of the tools they are more suited for a huge grill but its better than them being tiny good quality build might want to buy a nicer package to put them in if giving as a gift	21
0	you know beagles love chewing my new beagle who came from a shelter loves to chew i mean he loves chewing anything he sees ! ! ! since my husband and i work fulltime and we have to leave him in a crate all day every morning i stuff low sodium peanut butter and dog treat and he loves it lick and chew all day ! and even after all day chewing the kong does n't break at all i also like the kong bounds and rolls everywhere because of the funny shape and he loves to chase this is the best dog toy i 've ever got	21
1	the photo on amazon is n't representative of the product i received the frame is white or an extremely light silver i also bought a lacrosse technology wt 3122a 12 inch wood atomic analog clock which did n't match it 's photo either but at least i like it	21
0	picked up the time signal within five minutes set your time zone and you 're in business no more guessing if you have the correct time no more resetting twice a year for dst large display characters are easy to read neutral design fits with most any decor i would have preferred the moon phase colors to be reversed a full black circle is actually a full moon	21
0	i bought two of these weber roasters because they make the process of roasting chicken so easy no can and a nonstick surface make removing the cooked chicken so much easier and clean up is a cinch also because these roasters retain the juices in the pan the inside of my bbq is much cleaner and i do n't have to clean it after every chicken i cook	21
1	it arrived fast enough but i should have sent the chair back it 's pretty cheaply made the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape it 's ok but i 'll keep my eyes open for a better one and we wo n't swing on it i do n't think it would take it	21
0	this table is about twice the table you would expect at the price its size is ideal with a 2 passenger teak bench kompur wood is so like teak we 're staining our teak furniture to match the kompur wood it looks marvelous with the 30 round folding table fit and finish are a plus ca n't rate durability yet or it would have 5 stars	21
0	first i would like to say with a bit of trial and error this is a very good product well worth the price i want to comment on the great technical support from la crosse and the super customer support from amazon the first unit i received was faulty due to being calibrated wrong left la crosse a voice mail and was called within 36 hours tried to trouble shoot to no avail la crosse followed up next day e mailed amazon about issue replacement was in mail the next day outstanding	21
1	the tongs where hard to grip so what i did to avoid sending them back i took a pair of very small plyers and bent just the pointed ends inward like a claw now they are excellent grip great love the long handle and heavy duty soft rubber hope this helps those of you like me who hate sending stuff back	21
0	i purchased two of the 9 foot oxford garden market umbrellas in desperation we were having a backyard party at our home and my local stores were all out when they arrived a short time later i was very pleased to see how well made they were i especially like the pull cord to open and help close the umbrellas not only are these umbrellas attractive they are easy to use study and detail oriented i 'll probably get one more before the end of summer	21
0	this is a good rack it cleaned pretty easily and a nice compact size but the ribs are just a bit too close together \( i cook mainly full spare ribs \) i have rib racks from steven raichlen that are perfect the more spacious racks allow for better basting heat distribution and more even cooking when the meat touches like in the weber rack the meat does n't cook as well	21
0	this grill is the greatest for simplicity and ease of use it is compact and portable so there is no unsightly grill always hanging around your house or patio i use it in summer and winter and even set it up in the snow if you do charcoal grilling exclusively as i do this grill has the flexibility to adjust the combustion air and exhaust to suite what you are cooking for high temperatures such as for steaks i leave the top cover off takes perhaps 5 to 6 grillings before one learns all the right charcoal loadings and vent adjustments necessary cools off totally in 15 minutes if you close all vents	21
1	essentially a one season lightweight hibachi that does n't stand up to extended use so at 12 it 's too expensive but may be worth about 5	21
0	it 's a good watch i'm happy with it it does the jobthe altimeter is not that accurate but that 's the case with almost all the barometric altimeters if u do n't mind putting in the correct altitude once in an wile is okthe rest is a o k	21
0	i bought 2 sets of these chairs and the matching table i was pleasantly surprised when they arrived they are quite substantial without being heavy and their appearance is quite nice the chairs came with no assembly and the table was very easy to put together with the provided allen wrench the feet on the chairs are adjustable so that you can get rid of the iritation of off balanced legs overall this was an incredible value at approximately 650 for the set i was so impressed by the quality and price that i have since ordered the matching bench	21
0	very well made product i am extremely pleased heck of a lot better than that cheap cover i got from ebay last year that was very deceptively advertised regarding it 's durability	21
0	this canvass like cover is very sturdy and i think it will stand the test of time a friend of mine saw it and i ordered one for her too ajustable size makes it a fit for several sizes of firepits	21
0	we got this for my dad for father 's day i was not there for assembly but heard that it went well it is so much nicer looking in person than in the ad pix a very nice little unit dad did say that he might want to drill some holes in the bottom to get a better draft going but all in all we are thrilled with this product	21
0	accurate easy to program and good to look at well worth the spent	21
1	i received a painful injury and almost lost my finger to this recliner i grabbed the arm rest and tried to slide back into the recliner the mechanism under the arm rest snapped closed on my finger i could not get out of this trap had my wife not been there to help i would have lost my finger no way should this chair be sold to an unsuspecting public !	21
0	i was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when i sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what i needed and wanted to cancel the order he very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and i was impressed with this service gayla tregr	21

0	i bought one for my girlfriend over a few years ago it sets itself and projects the time on the ceiling in a soft red this is an amazing feature no more getting up or turning your head to check the time it makes the sleep experience much more comfortable	21
0	we had bought one of these for this house loved it so much we bought one for the other house too the original one was bought w the 22 wok which is gorgeous we use both w woks and it 's kewl easy to break down for travel too only thing was i shoulda bought the cover for the 22 wok while they were available ca n't seem to get one now	21
0	i bought this for my husband for christmas to replace an old \( scary looking \) smoker it was a real pain having to ask his folks to send mesquite wood from texas to massachusetts then cut it up soak it etc we tried the bradley smoker this weekend while we had the unusually warm weather it comes with pellets of wood which get fed in automatically much easier the prime rib was done in no time at all we finished it off in the oven for a crispier outside we also smoked fresh kielbasa both were amazing ca n't wait to try the cold smoke feature	21
0	i just got this turner and it feels really nice in my hand the grip feels very comfortable and the turner has a very nice solid and balanced feel i got this turner so it would work better with the cast iron griddle i got i tried out tonite cooking burgers and it felt easier to flip the patties than a normal cheap spatula i felt like a short order cook !	21
0	the hammock is fine particularly for the great price unfortunately my pine trees dripped sap onto the hammock which is a pain to get off not the hammock 's fault i guess it just was n't such a good idea	21
0	elegant and simple design with that awesome rubber handle that put oxo good grips on the grip map i bought this to complete my good grips bbq set the only thing it lacks that some bbq'rs may miss is a bottle opener on the end of the handle but that does n't bother me seeing as i do n't drink beer and it also gives the tool a cleaner design if the dog does n't get ahold of it it will last a lifetime	21
1	sorry to say this is not good for pets like it says my poor two cats as soon as i plugged them in they went running to a room that did not have them and would not come out please do not get if you have cats	21
0	buy this little fun toy clock it 's a blast in the bedroom just look up and you know the time i love it ! cute little thing the front panel is worthless \( to see \) but who needs it	21
0	i have been very pleased with my hammock chair this past summer the pillow was a real bonus my kids and i can hang out in the yard for hours	21
0	i did n't know much about grills so i asked around everyone told me to get a weber grill and after reading reviews i could see why i just got my grill this weekend and we have used it 3 times already we love it ! very sturdy solid and super easy to use all you need to do is turn the gas on turn a knob and press the ignitor ! everything we have cooked has come out perfectly very even cooking this grill may not have all the bells and whistles but you can bet it will last for years to come	21
0	living in florida we grill almost daily i seem to burn out a set of enamel grates every 15 months or so hopefully the stainless grates will last much longer without a doubt the best price for the grates in store or online was at amazon ! !	21
0	great looking and quite large easy to see from a distance though the other two dials are correspondingly small updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate i wish that i had a dozen of them the price is very reasonable also i certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually	21
0	well look no further my apartment complex does n't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed i was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my george forman kettle grill i did n't want to lug it in and out all summer so i took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly ! i can now leave my george forman kettle grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements	21
0	clock was a great value and looks good on the wall just keeps ticking always on time thumps up to river city clock	21
0	this solved my problem of ants in the feeder had it hanging on our deck all summer long and they never got to it ! this feeder is also very easy to clean and because it is made of glass does not pick of that aging hazy appearance i highly recommend it to anyone	21
1	i found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use you ca n't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on you can move hot plates etc but you ca n't really carry anything with the mitt on not worth the money albeit not very expensive	21
0	i purchased this table to replace my second broken glass top table that broke during a storm as a result of the wind i will never buy a glass top patio table again this table is especially lovely to look at and fit in perfectly with my chairs and umbrella looks like it all came together had to learn my lesson about glass i wish it was a couple inches bigger but it 's really just fine	21
0	fast delievery great price and quality we will enjoy it many years to come	21
0	this thing catches mosquitos ! it 's easy to set up and you dont have to buy propane it was a lot less expensive than the mosquito magnet and it does what they say it does	21
0	they are very attractive and we had no trouble putting them together our only complaint the stain ran during a rain storm and stained our patio	21
1	way to small of a cushion had to purchase another one from a local store	21
0	the bench is comfortable and has enough weight so the wind does not blow it over the cushion is real nice and it dries quickly plus it fastens to the bench with only two small velcro straps two people can sit on the bench in comfort	21
0	this is a great clock when i bought it about a week ago i put the battery in the clock and placed it on the wall in my family room where my old clock used to be that was it at first the clock appeared to be broken but within 5 minutes it adjusted itself and has been running perfectly ever since this clock can be seen clearly in my family room from 25ft away as i get older i like things to be bigger and this clock gets the job done while still looking attractive my wife likes the clock because she does not confuse the short hand with the long hand from a distance	21
1	the bbq mitt had lots of mold on it and had an awful smell the box paper and all smelled bad amazon was quick to accept a return with no return shipping charges amazon is great as usual but they need to drop this product	21
0	i really am pleased with my solar lights they are the right color everything they seem to stay light longer	21
0	i love this clock i won it as an incentive through my creative memories sales i love that it is always set to the accurate time my 4 and 6 year old love to tell me what time it is and at what phase of the moon it is presently \( they always double check outside \) it 's been a great addition to our home	21
1	i got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look after eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke we are not overweight people \( 140 190lb \) very sad that we have to replace them because we were happy with appearance	21
1	shame on me ! i should have read the reviews before i purchased this piece of garbage i had the same experience as others cumbersome to fill trouble attaching to the window then the whole thing crashes to the deck an atractive price until you find you 're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped not to mention the poor quality design could n't give me another one of these	21
0	to keep it from cracking i am using mineral oil on mine and keeping it out of the weather	21
