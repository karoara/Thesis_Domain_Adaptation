0	i bought this because i have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and i get tired of washing it i thought i could use this every other day and get by however it does n't make your hair look freshly washed it is just ok it takes bed head hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while after a couple of hours though my hair looks oily and stringy again i use it before i take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning then i end up washing my hair later	15
0	i like jonathan anton some of his products but this one was a very bad one it smelled like swamp water his other products smell great i do n't know what happened to this one	15
0	i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses there must be a quality control problem my bottle had no noticible pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair i was only trying to go 1 day without washing what a disappointing product and a waste of my money	15
0	after using this product i felt less than fresh then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	15
0	i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel fresh in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey nothing fresh about it	15
0	jonathan conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff you ca n't fool them twice i know we will all be seeing jonathan product on the clearence rack in a big lots with in a year or two	15
0	on a scale of 1 to 5 the packaging gets a negative 1 you ca n't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle ended up removing top for value of product jonathan gets a 1 for quality of product 3 the conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter need to use more than average the conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair but no better than other quality brands i do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time but bed head has a similar product that 's been out for a while for that option i would rather choose bed head for quality and price	15
0	jonathan should spent more time with scott from zorbitt because the packaging is second rate the product itself was subpar also	15
0	used along with shampoo theory my hair turned out worse than it ever had not recommended at least for medium wavy hair no frizz control	15
0	unless you have a new softball glove to break in this product is not for you way way too much oil just nappy i might as well have put mayo in my hair	15
0	i had high hopes for this stuff i have watched blow out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair but i cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves i have tried it on wet hair damp hair dry hair no discernable difference i will stick to my frederic fekkai products they actually work	15
0	i spent a lot of money on this product waited with anticipation for it to arrive when i applied it it did nothing to create curl and did n't even define the curls that i already had my hair was limp and frizzy by days end it smelled nice that 's about it cheap o suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl	15
0	this hairspray was too wet and too stiff it ruined my clean freshly washed hair and made my blonde locks stiff and darker yuck ! ! ! ! i love the voluminizing shampoo conditioner as well as the voluminizing foam but when i lightly sprayed the finishing hair spray it ruined everything i will stick to an areosol hairspray instread of a pump sorry jonathan	15
0	if you buy this shampoo buy something else with it to get this glue out of your hair i guarantee you will be disappointed it is the equivalent of herbal essence \( also leaves your hair like glue	15
0	this shampoo made my hair flat and dry when i used it every day so i tried using another shampoo and used jonathan 's once a week the one day i used jonathan shampoo my hair was noticably flat and dull i ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo what a disappointment	15
0	is this shampoo or sap \? \? what exactly is it supposed to do \? \? i received a sample of this shampoo and i am ever so glad i got to try it free before i actually spent money on it not only did my hair feel like straw as mentioned by other reviewers but it was so heavy i could n't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo i 'll save this one for halloween	15
0	i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out unfortunately i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess unfortunately the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that 's about it	15
0	i purchased this item after seeing jonathan 's show as much as i enjoyed his program i am sorry to say that this product is just terrible it weighed down my hair and made my hair look greasy before i was even done styling ! the day after using the product my hair looked like an oil slick ! i do wish jonathan much success but these products need a lot of work very disappointing after spending almost 60 for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard	15
0	my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned i thought it was too drippy i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand i would not recommend this conditioner	15
0	this foam product by jonathan is okay the reviews on his products are highly overrated the price does n't bother me at all there are better foams for thin and limp hair	15
0	this product totally frizzed out my hair i had been having good luck for once with paul mitchell 's foaming mousse this jonathan product sadly rather than taming my hair induced the frizz a lot perhaps a stronger formula is needed or maybe i just do n't have fine limp enough hair i was very sad	15
0	this product works well when i use it with a curling iron the low rating is for the cost i just do n't think it is worth over 20	15
0	product made my hair sticky and gooey i am a personal fan of his and it got rushed to market needs re formulatin	15
0	i have dried my hair daily for 20 years now i bought the t3 tourmaline with great excitement come on its 200 the most i have ever used on a hairdryer i did not reduce my hair drying time at all but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny but all in all too much money for too little help ! nor	15
0	i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality perhaps worth the price to some but i 'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness most ionic and infrared is gibberish tourmaline a gemstone has electrical properties \( when squeezed or heated it develops a charge across the crystal \) but that has nothing to do with hair drying or ionizing air or anything else i 'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam	15
0	i have dyed red hair a lot of dyed red hair this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair will not purchase again	15
0	i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store first of all do not expect to see any plumping what so ever it makes no difference in how your lips look secondly it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball the only reason this gloss is 18 is because of the too faced name brand dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good better for a few bucks at the drugstor	15
0	i would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball the roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out and you find yourself rolling it over over again to get a decent amount of gloss the gloss itself is pretty \( once you get enough on your lips \) and it does taste smell delicious but it is way too much trouble with the roller ball i would suggest they make this with an applicator brush it would make a great product	15
0	bought this to help myself achieve some punch with my existing waves all i got were crimps in wierd places found the instruction booklet completely not useful i tried and tried but could not produce anything remotely close to a wave curl etc save your money	15
0	not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw even my own sylist said whatever you are using stop you hair feels very damaged it goes back to normal texture if i use my other shampoos i made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the jonathan shampoo and it was it went into the trash do n't purchase this stuff unless you 're going for the scarecrow look	15
0	after the debacle that was dirt i tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty is this a joke i am sure that jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here i am trying to wash this out of my hair with his very shampoo and all i have is tears clearly this is not product without tears	15
0	i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better my hair was super straight and shiny and it did n't get frizzy even in humid weather then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now	15
0	i received this as a gift i was thrilled with the results the first few times i used it then the little red light went out while i was straightening my hair and it has never worked since i only got to use it three times	15
0	this product did not dry my hair as described on the box it did straighten my hair but that was all i had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this t3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it	15
0	on my third use i set it down on the carry case and it sizzled i looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord right where it is connected to the handle ! i immediately unplugged it and now there 's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out i am so grateful i was n't using it on my hair when this happened ! what with the straightening balm i was using and everything my hair could 've easily started on fire	15
0	i tried doing a patti labelle do where my hair stood up at an angle and it fell over all limp and oily my hair felt dirtier than when i put dirt in it	15
0	this was terrible i tried getting my weave shaped like a helicopter for my prom but it turn out looking like a melting ceiling fan like in something about mary splooge would have been cheaper and would have held bettah	15
0	i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k y jelly frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams	15

0	all of the glowing and raving reviews of this product were all entered on april 24 or april 25 coincidence \? i think not these are people paid by strivectin for their honest reviews	15
0	i bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work well it does n't i followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever i'm 24 23 when i tried the product no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all if it does n't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff i wish i had n't listened to the raves on this product	15
0	i find it strangely odd that everyone who gave this product a fantastic review 1 has only ever reviewed one product on amazon2 all seem to have been posted on the 24th caveat emptor	15
0	i bought the cream hoping to get rid of or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy i have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results it smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts i was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews i'm now very disappointed if something sounds too good to be true it is	15
0	i used to love curious i asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion however a few months after i got it it started to smell funny over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it when i opened the bottle i gaged at the stench i poured it down the sink and it was yellow i do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please do n't buy it with the atomizer the lotion still smells good	15
0	like many others my perfume turned yellow as well i think it only happens with the atomizer perhaps exposure to air soured the perfume i am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good the product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set i am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf life i am never buying perfume from britney spears obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume	15
0	i immediately fell in love with the fragrance and my husband bought me the really big bottle i wanted to savor it and make it last much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol it also formed a nasty crusty substance all over the pump and bottle i am soooo disappointed ! ! !	15
0	i had very high hopes for this cream as it appears they went the extra mile for quality not so the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face making for some tense moments that should not be there i have used many creams so far art of shaving is the best casswell massey is ok as is aveda avoid truefitt	15
0	i just purchased the small bottle \( thank god \) of the ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner it seems like it made my hair a little softer but the smell is horrendous i have gotten the worst headache from the smell of this product so overall it may make my hair feel softer but there is no way i will put this stuff on my head again the rest is going in the trash	15
0	i got this product as a sample it has the worst scent ever it took me 2 days of washing to get the horrible smell out of my hair	15
0	i do not like this shampoo at all in fairness i did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair it seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet the one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which i do love did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well	15
0	this thing was such a waste it does not get cold enough to do anything it also wo n't stay flat against your face to give any soothing sensation to your eyes overpriced and worthless item	15
0	i ca n't believe how much amazon and other retail stores \( like sephora \) charge for this i buy prevage md \( which is double the strength of regular prevage \) from my plastic surgeon 's office and i only pay 120 why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff \? if you do n't want to go to the doctor to buy the md version then you can get it off ebay for around 100	15
0	i bought this product in the color paparazzi from sephora online i read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines i was very disappointed when i finally got it and tried it there is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13 i could not wear this to work or even an evening out as i would feel like a clown the only place this would look semi good at would be a nightclub where it is dark i was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter i do not recommend this product at all i also returned this promptly back to sephora	15
0	not really impressed with this product it applies okay but the colors look really bright and odd on the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product i like lancome 's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice	15
0	i was excited to try out this product given all the rave reviews but after just 2 uses my face broke out in a rash ! it 's awful ! and i do not have sensitive skin by any stretch of the imagination i would not recommend this product	15
0	i have thick wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy i do n't think it is worth the money when i have found other poducts \( such as redken \) that work better and cost less	15
0	i was looking forward to receiving this body lotion however was very disappointed when i opened it and smelled the fragrance it smells exactly like paint then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint like scent i will not buy any more philosophy products the less expensive fragrances lotions are so much better that you buy from target wal mart etc	15
0	i love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel but this lotion is not getting as much love from me it does n't smell the same to me and on a bad day makes me a little sick it 's sweeter smelling thing is i need lotion and i do n't want competing scents otherwise i might have rated it even lower	15
0	i'm all about lip plumping glosses and this one sucked it has a really slippery constistancy and did not plump my lis at all i 'll stick with my too faced lip injection products	15
0	actually i would give the product 5 stars and the packaging a minus 2 citylips really does work plumping and hydrating it does required repeated applications but the packaging results in about 10 12 of the \( expensive \) material being completely unavailable ! worse if you try to wiggle the \( too short \) applicator in order to get the last 10 the container breaks at the neck \( actually one came already cracked in my case ! \) true they do offer some colors at 2 3 price but most effective is to apply clear and go outside the lipline and the clear almost never has gone on sale !	15
0	works as a good lip balm but i didt really see a difference in the size of my lips wouldnt buy it again	15
0	i used two tubes in one month one for daytime wear and one for nighttime and when i was n't going out \( clear \) i like the product how it looks and smoothes out my lips but i just cannot afford to pay 60 a month on my lips ! if they lower the price by 10 12 i will buy it again but not until they do	15
0	i am such a huge fan of the philosophy grace line that i thought i would really love this too i find that it is much too light for me it does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice but it does n't last long at all i guess i 'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice i'm wearing it nobody has said anything so far the shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes wonderful lather but no smell to speak of i will stick with amazing grace baby grace and pure grace those are wonderful	15
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	15
0	at first it 's a beautiful floral scent then it dries to something that gives me a headache i cannot detect what smell it is but it 's not pleasant i cannot detect vanilla in this at all	15
0	i was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so i gave it a try i love it ! it 's surprising it changes on me when i first put it on it takes on a white floral scent when i first applied it i was surprised that it seemed like a floral but hours later i was smelling vanilla i was very surprised to realize it was me ! very interesting ! very cool ! lighter than the original poison it may become my spring summer choice	15
0	it does n't smell woody to me at all well maybe a fake pinesol type of smell it smells really artificial and almost chemical y i guess it 's not so bad and some people might like it but i did n't	15
0	i loved the smell in the magazines so i decided to get it well it was good at first and then i got tired it smells a little cheap and sort of like pine i sometiems use it but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits \( that 's what i use it for \) i think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long	15
0	this item does n't include everything that is mention in the details i would n't even pay a dollar for it don't purchase this item ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	15
0	i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about i was not impressed it smells just like ordinary soap so what \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well you can get soap that smells better at wal mart !	15
0	i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly kinky hair it did n't do anything for my hair and i did n't like the smell \( but its not that big of a deal \) i returned it i do n't think its for coarse kinky curls but maybe for others textures lt for coarse 'naturals' try carol 's daughter 's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line	15
0	nanoparticles \? \? \? \? i was in the process of re ordering this item until i read the description apparently you 're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe thanks a lot lancome ! not on my face !	15
0	sorry to say i found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying something i have n't experienced with other removers in addition it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish on the plus side it 's fragrance free and reasonable in price	15
0	i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours when i went back to get a lighter color it did the same i think there 's just too much yellow in this foundation and considering it 's oil free it did n't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you or if you 're looking for a similar oil free foundation i would highly recommend laura mercier oil free or chanel dpf	15
0	as much as i love fat girl slim i thought i 'd try serious cellulite soap to go with it i was not impressed at all it has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap it was what i thought it would be at all the size of the bar was good the price is good but i am not pleased at all with the quality	15
0	the texture of this cleanser is waxy i could barely get it off my face and i broke out badly after using it i double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser and that i had n't mistakenly put some other product on my face it smells wonderful though i tried to think of alternate uses for the product but finally threw it away	15
0	i was so excited to try this product from all of the great reviews that i read on it boy where they wrong i used this product for 2 months and saw no difference in my skin at all i have used a lot of products and would have to rate this down at the bottom of my list especially for how much it cost	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	i hate to say this since philosophy is one of my favorite brands but this is probably the worst mascara i have ever used it clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove it does not simply wash off it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink about half of them remain attached to your lashes and i 've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara everything else i 've ever tried from philosophy was fantastic but the best mascara out there hands down is from lancome	15
0	this clarifying lotion is too harsh i used it once and my skin is itchy dry and red i think i'm allergic to it basically the chemicals in these products are really harmful most of the time people do n't need these products all they do is clog up what nature has given us this lotion is horrible	15
0	i'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes i seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you ca n't smell a thing yes the scent is great i love it but the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me really really disapointed i guess i'm just used to the channel and ralph lauren lines they are quality and can last most of the day this stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days	15
0	i like the smell of this fragrance very much but have trouble with the sprayer mister maybe i just have a defective one but i need to unscrew the top and dab it on	15
0	i love the smell of this perfume however it does n't stay on i have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem i was sold by sjp on this perfume when she appeared on oprah loved it when i went to the counter at the mall to check it out i have been using it for about 2 months now and it just does n't last about an hour after i put it on i \( or my husband \) ca n't smell it anymore trust me i learned to apply it liberally and it still does n't stay totally disappointed	15
0	my husband was revolted by the smell of this product i have bad sinuses so it did n't bother me as far as effectiveness goes there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction i used it everyday several times a day and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands at a cost of almost 20 for 8 5oz i got skunked	15
0	shiseido is known for creating top quality products that do not irritate even the most sensitive of skin my mother and many of my friends mothers swear by their benefiance line i cannot tell you how disappointed i am in their pureness line it is for oily problem skin i have been using this for about 10 days and while it goes on nicely and has this wonderful light clean fragrance it had made my skin even oilier i thought my skin just had to get acclimated to a new skincare regimen but this is not the case	15
0	i'm a huge fan of the majority of the philosophy line along with adoring the amazing grace scent ! i thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent boy was i wrong ! ! if you love amazing grace this smells nothing like it it smells like plastic flowers not appealing at all even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic if you want a fantastic exfoliator try gingerbread man or the margarita scrub those are devine ! i think i 'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on	15
0	this scrub did n't moisturize my skin at all and the salt stings ! it seems like it is more of a cleanser than anything and the scent is boring	15
0	i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about i was not impressed it smells just like ordinary soap so what \? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well you can get soap that smells better at wal mart !	15
0	this is one of the cutest shower caps i 've owned but it did n't keep my hair dry the cap kept sliding up my head sephora 's shower cap also did the same thing but at least it only cost 5 so far i 've found the best shower caps are the complimentary ones i receive when i occasionally stay in a hotel	15
0	i sprayed a tester sheet at a perfume counter with this scent after shopping a bit i went back and decided to buy it it 's nice and light but after wearing it for the first time i realized it 's too light i could n't even smell it when i held my wrist to my nose the second time i decided to apply more i must 've used 6 7 sprays and still only a lingering aroma for the amount you have to use and the faintness of the scent i would n't recommend it	15
0	i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips it just wont glide you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em clinique liners are the worst one in the market	15
0	i read the label and it is not a rare tropical oil at all but plain old american palm oil ! false advertising really bothers me it did condition my hair well but i agree that the fragrances \( which are added to it by the way \) make the odor very strong and unpleasant the price is also very high i will not order this again	15
0	i have very dry frizzy hair this treatment left my hair softer now my hair is a big soft frizz ball it added too much body i like this better for use as a grooming gloss	15
0	this is a hit or miss product i ordered a 5 oz jar and while the smell is nauseating \( burnt coffee caramel cigarettes \) the product did work for a while my extremely dry curly hair was soft and shiny but then the product became too heavy for my hair and stopped working i would save my money and experiment with other oils such as coconut jojoba almond avocado before shampooing or after i adjusted my hair routine by using a natural shampoo and conditioner and adding jojoba oil to my curl cream and it has never been happier if you do want to try the product ask the company to send you samples or find a store that sells them	15
0	this item smells like lemon pine sol it is not what you think you are paying for its not worth the money	15
0	as a rule i like the seche products this polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment i wasted my money on this one	15
0	i have been using frederic fekkai 's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so i thought i would try the luscious curls it was very thick which may be a good thing since there is so little of it but does n't spread through hair very well it left my hair a little crunchy and the crunchiness did n't go away for a few hours when it did dry i felt that my curls just kind of hung there without much body or shine i have used loreal 's professional line prior to this and i will definitely go back to it it 's cheaper better quality and twice the size of luscious curls	15
0	my hair was still frizzy after using this product	15
0	this product was a waste of good money it does n't even work to control frizz as promised the curls are limp and after about an hour or so there is a lot of frizz i would not buy this product again	15
0	i 've been using this product for almost 2 months and i have seen no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my dark circles and yes it does burn ! the only thing i'm glad about is that i bought it from ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere i 've had dark under eye circles all my life i suppose i should just learn to live with them and save my money i will not be wasting my money on this product again	15
0	does n't really change appearance of eye area i'm 37 and am starting to get some lines puffiness and circles but used product 3weeks and was n't impressed	15
0	i 've been using this product for about two weeks now and i have n't seen the slightest change in the dark circles under my eyes i do n't know how long you have to use it before you see a difference but i do n't think it 's going to show any change in the dark circles personally i think i wasted my money i do n't think theres anything on the market that can help dark circles under the eyes lind	15
0	i have sensitive skin and this product burned my skin leaving burn marks for weeks ! finally i went to the dermatologist who had to prescribe something to help the skin heal please check with your doctor first before trying this	15
0	not goo	15
0	this does n't work first time i tried it it seemed as if my eye liner smudged more so i tried it again and again and again i 've given up on it it totally does n't work	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	i used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months while i thought it moisturized fine i did not notice any change in my lines tone texture for the money i 'd go get several tubes of the neutrogena anti aging products they work better have a nicer texture and smell much better	15
0	i used this product for a couple of months with no visible result in addition it 's quite greasy and since it 's not made to be used on the face we can understand that but that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses	15
0	but i wo n't buy this again it smells good and dipping it into one of the bare escentual powders to make a lipstick is neat but the product does n't really moisturize my lips and i have n't found a color i like on my lips once i dip this into a bare escentuals powder i wo n't be buying this again i will probably just try a lip gloss next time	15
0	the texture of this product is fine but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore therefore overpriced now if the flavor and scent were exceptional it might be worth the high price tag but it does n't smell that great it smells rather like over cooked coffee beans the bare escentuals soy mocha spf 15 has a much nicer smell and texture if you 're wanting a bare escentuals product	15
0	my mom had bought their darkest shade and after applying it it was obvious that she was wearing reddish dark brown eyebrow pencil it did n't blend in at all it stood out against her black eyebrow hairs so i bought her an eyebrow pencil from yves saint laurent in 5 that one is perfect not too black and not too brown	15
0	i am a big philosophy fan i have bought the best facial cleanser ever from them \( purity \) i have two other fragrances that i bought scent unsmelled from them amazing grace is lovely and pure grace is tremendous get them do n't buy falling in love it 's yucky	15
0	i'm very disappointed with the results i am fairly young 31 i have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear it really did n't do anything to my skin plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell i do not recommend this	15
0	i have been using this product for about a month and all it 's done is given me puffy eyes there is no proof that this product works at all and the fda has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles i 've used botox before and believe me botox works this product does n't so obviously it 's not better than botox i bet the people who gave it 5 stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the basic research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is	15
0	i used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months while i thought it moisturized fine i did not notice any change in my lines tone texture for the money i 'd go get several tubes of the neutrogena anti aging products they work better have a nicer texture and smell much better as for better than botox buyer beware when you hear this line	15
0	one i do n't think this is better than botox botox works instantly and more dramatically but it 's more expensive however when you think about how much you 're spending on this strivectin applying it every day for the rest of your life you could get botox \( yes you need to get more botox every several months but the costs are about the same \) not only that but botox simply works better however if you just ca n't afford botox then i would buy rulinea fx which is the exact same ingredients as strivectin but half the price it 's available on hsn co	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	this did not help my skin at all i would not reccomend it to anyone ! save your money !	15
0	this product did nothing for my t zone i was still very shiney and oily by mid day i recommend benefit 's dr feelgood i gave this product two stars because though it did n't control oil for me it did n't feel heavy or clog my pores	15
0	this product costs 10 times more then a regular gel but it does not even work as well as a regular shaving gel its like putting a thin layer of soap on you face it did not help at all no doubt the people who marked this up one thousand present are the geniuses in the marketing department because it fooled me just like it fooled everyone 18 for a gel ! it must be more effective i 'll give it a try there is a sucker born every day jose' \( sucker	15
0	i have fairly sensative skin and can use most dior products but this product made my skin peel off of my face be very careful and test this first on your hand	15
0	i love coconuts and would love it if this made my hair smell like coconuts instead my hair smells like burnt coconuts or even burnt newspaper the conditioning qualities of the product are n't good enough \( and it certainly is n't cheap enough \) to make me purchase this again at least not until i develop a hankering for smokey smelling hair	15
0	it smells great like coconut i have long curly hair and it made my hair dry and brittle i 've noticed this with all of the lush conditioners i 've tried so i would not recommend it for naturally curly hair 2 stars for the great smell	15
0	this is the only lush product thus far that i 've absolutely hated the smell of this is downright revolting and it does n't do anything for my hair try retread \( my favourite lush conditioner \) veganese or even american cream over this one	15
0	so i bought this item and i hated it i wash my hair everyday and it completly dryed out my hair ! it does smell good though but other than that ive used it about 4 times and thats all it took to realize this is just not for me	15
0	i found this product did absolutely nothing for me granted i do n't have huge wrinkles but the few i do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse ! i wish i had asked around from friends cause if i had i would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money i'm wondering a couple of things what all the fuss is about with strivectin \? is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some do n't \? and is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that really works \? \( if it works i do n't mind spending the money	15
0	i usually enjoy products by philosophy but this stuff is not worth washing the family xolo with amigo trust me this stuff stinks ! if a margarita is what you are craving then stop in at the local don pablo 's at lunchtime not only does this stuff smell bad on the skin but as the bottle warns using this product can cause irritation to the skin and the urinary tract not good i will say one good thing about this product it made the drains in my home smell lime fresh for days after having poured the entire contents down them	15
0	i quickly realized while in the shower that i do n't want to smell like a margarita all day it does lather well and i do n't find the smell to overpowering but it 's not that special warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair	15
0	i ca n't say enough about philosohpy but i read another review recomending not to get the mimosa scent because it smells like the tang drink so i purchased the margarita instead i hate to say it but it is probabloy about the same for this product it smells so much like kool aid that i ca n't use it the smell is way to sweet i am a big margarita fan but this smells nothing like it ! just a caution	15
0	poor quality construction the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use plus it was much rougher than something like loofah you might as well tie a couple of shoestrings on a dog brush and use that	15
0	did n't like this product all of the actual scrub \( salt \) is at the top and minimal felt like i would 've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub it did smell nice and i like the packaging	15
0	i ordered this march 17th and didnt recieve until april 5th ! ! it smelled horrible like a weird chalk chemical smell i called lush who said it was probably just a bad batch and to send it back at my own expense \( 5 \) this is after i waited forever to recieve and the product smells horrible im very mad at lush com and will not ever order anything from them again except for the angel delight soap pissedoff	15
0	i was soooo excited to get this in the mail i have very oily skin the smell is great but the product is messy and my skin looks like i have acne i tried it with fresh farmacy and was so disappointed the shipping is insanely high i will stick to mac skincare from now on	15
0	i enjoyed using this product because i liked the tingling from the mint not necessarily a good thing actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face the kaolin and bentonite are drying agents peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin if you separate out the so called natural ingredients you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses and if it does n't come straight out of the ground it ai n't natural anymore ! i give it a 2 because i was a sucker for the tingling not because i saw any improvement in my skin 's texture look or feel	15
0	well i dint like the smell at all i see nothing lovely about this perfum if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season check out fantasy by britney spears it smells so nice or curious by britney thats a classic its a must give or have j lo 's live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present or for urself its not really worth ur money !	15
0	and it 's called narcisso rodriguez buy the nr you 'll like it a whole lot more	15
0	i have oily blemish prone skin and i was told by my mother who used to work for the clinique estee lauder family to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non cosmogenic this product irritated my skin so much that i just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness the only reason why i used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working if it was working it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than i ever had all at once not worth your money	15
0	i do n't know why i keep giving clinique a chance i have extremely oily skin and this only made it oilier if you want a very expensive toner that keeps oil away try clean clear for oily skin it 's better and cheaper	15
0	overpriced for a mediocre soap with a terrible perfume	15
0	i love clinique products in general but i do n't like the soap in the liquid form it has a strong chemical smell to it and i find myself holding my breath while washing my face i much prefer the bar soap and would n't buy the liquid again for all that it seemed much more convenient no complaints on cleaning ability	15
0	both lipsticks were on back order i never received either one please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received	15
0	this product might be better on oily skin with no make up the point of it was lost on me it may create a barrier between treatment products moisturizer and make up but it did nothing to perfect my skin in fact when i touched my face i could feel make up pilling and rolling off it has a dry heavy feeling to it do n't use too much and be careful about dry patches i thought it would make a better canvas of my skin i now use laura mercier 's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow i did n't like the formulation of philosophy 's product at all	15
0	i really wanted to like this i had heard so much about it and everyone seems to love it it smells like sunless tanning lotion on me i hate that smell does it smell like that to anyone else \? oh well i am disappointed because i really wanted to love it	15
0	i wanted it to smell good but it just smells so cheap to me i tried it several times but it is not amazing i would not recommend this perfume	15
0	i normally like warm sensual type perfumes but i wanted to try something different for a change i liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey well i have to disagree i think it is very perfumey and not subtle at all to me it has a very sharp high toned scent which is almost acrid i thought at first that maybe i had sprayed too much on so i tried just a little spritz still very strong and sharp and i agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets i will definitely not be ordering this again	15
0	i know this is philosophy 's big seller but i hate the way it smells it reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous my husband hated it too as did my son i like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet that is about as close as it gets if you want a good philosophy scent go with falling in love pure grace or philosophy the scent all of them are better than amazing grace i do n't care to smell like a perfumy granny thank you i 'll stick with my falling in love	15
0	i had trouble rinsing this stuff out it weighed my hair down and my hair is dry also my son came up to me and said why does your hair smell so funny \? i think it 's too conditioning for my hair and too smelly	15
0	one of my boys bought this item for me and well its ok for the price its kinda sticky on the skin unless you rub it in really well and the scent is extremly light which i dont like now if they were to make it stronger this would be a 5 star product	15
0	i read many positive reviews on pure grace and decided to try it since i love a fresh clean scent i was very disapointed when i used it as it reminded me of jean nate which to me is an old lady smell it was more musky than clean smelling i could n't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it it smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil that is the only way i can describe it	15
0	i am dissatisfied with lush 's claims that many of its products like this one are natural i encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in lush 's products i have yet to see a lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety there are numerous other brands of truly all natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently	15
0	its cute but it blocks barely any light lace strap is itchy and uncomfortable	15
0	i 've had this dryer for almost a year now and like the styists who also own it i find it temperamental it does a great job while it 's working but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months if you turn the dryer off you 'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on now it turns off while i'm in the middle of doing my hair the stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other \( s \) cool off as i said when they work they 're terrific i'm going to replace mine with another brand	15
0	it could cover the tattoo but after while it fails not fully invisible	15
0	if you order this kit make sure you have time to practice with it ! it takes several practice applications to get the shade just right while it does cover completely it is not flawless you can tell that you 've covered something up on your skin if it 's not a big deal you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit	15
0	i bought two clarisonic brushes one as a gift and one for myself although the product works well unfortunately both brushes were defective the trouble started occurring about two months after using one brush started out with two speed settings but eventually only functioned at the low setting the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged ! my experience with the customer service has been terrible they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty be careful if you are going to travel abroad the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v !	15
0	this fragrance is ok for the teen princesses this scent does n't linger and is too subtle not as nice as vera wang vanity or sheer veil i do n't recommend this unless you are 16 and under i gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it	15
0	did not care for this one really it is better as a body wash	15
0	i ordered this for fun and have since decided that it 's definitely not for me in any way it 's very drying on my skin even though it 's thick and creamy the label says it 's award winning but does n't state what award it 's received \( if any ! \) i fail to see what might warrant it being award winning the scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy also it 's absurdly priced given the quality i 've tried a few philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed	15
0	i'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product i opened this bottle expecting a totally yummy scent but what i got was nothing like what i expected ! when i read that it smelled the nesquick i thought i 'd like it anyway because i love strawberry nesquick but this stuff smells like well i ca n't describe it all i know is i wish i had n't paid 16 for it live and learn i guessperhaps the strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel smells better off topic why do they have a strawberry milk shake 3 in 1 gel and a strawberry ice cream 3 in 1 gel \? would n't they smell just the same	15
0	after reading reviews of the other philosophy items i was hoping this would smell more like a strawberry milkshake than fake strawberry quick	15
0	i bought this hoping i would look good and get my face cleaned no lie this soap makes you look uglier than you really are so unless you wanna smell a little weird and not look your best dont buy this soap ! im serious !	15
0	this soap washed really well but after i rinsed it off it felt like my skin had a soapy film over it it also made my skin feel stipped i did not really like this soap and instead recommend basis facial products instead	15
0	i knew i was taking a chance buying a cheap eye cream and sure enough i was right it did nothing ! well yo get what you pay for ! i was going to try the ocuderm or ddf products and i guess i will do that now costs more but the results i hear are great i should of known better	15
0	you gotta love this woman 's moxy when the high life of being robert prayer requests in the dumpster tilton 's wife evaporated she picked herself right back up and developed a riff of her own selling worthless cosmetics always plenty of suckers to be found	15
0	i will keep this review short the product does not work period i have been using the product morning and evening since the begining of february and have not seen a single change i just bought some olay eye cream a week ago and can already see an improvement	15
0	some of the lush products are wonderful this is n't one of the	15
0	i bought this make up at neiman marcus excited to try it and i was horribly disappointed it was hard to apply \( i accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air \) and what i did manage to get on my face it did not cover much for the price they wanted this is unexcusable i promptly returned my airflash and got my money back i do not recommend this product	15
0	i have this gloss in carney while i like the color the gloss is very gooey and gloppy and it does n't stay on long at all i would not buy it again	15
0	i have noticable undereye cirlces and bought this product in the hopes it you lighten them a bit i use this product in the mornings and evenings for several weeks nothing changed i figured maybe it would take more then a few weeks to notice anything so i continued to use this product \( use the entire jar just to give it plenty of time \) still not difference could be seen for me it was a waste of money	15
0	this item did not even work and for the price you pay i feel it was a rip off	15
0	i received this free from sephora as a birthday present because i signed up as a beauty insider i gave it to my neice for her 7th birthday and she likes it but there 's no reason this product should cost 16 i'm betting the ingredients packaging shipping costs do n't total more than 3 i would n't buy it	15
0	i like the philosophy line but the vanilla birthday cake body wash does n't smell so much like birthday cake as it does bananas the product is great though	15
0	i was n't really thrilled with this product it smells great but as soon as the shower is over the thrill is gone	15
0	i read many good reviews for this product on this site and elsewhere so i eagerly bought it it came in a quaint little tin but i thought it smelled kind of awful as a skin softner it worked well but i threw it out after using it only a few times because of the way it smelled	15
0	i bought this and shortly after i started using it the sides of my noise started swelling up and peeling i did n't know what was going on and i stopped using it and it immediately went away as soon as i started wearing it again the swelling and pain came back i am a person who does n't break out very often and i can tolerate many products i now have a permanent red mark on the right side of my nose and it has n't faded yet i tried to take it back to nordstrom and they would n't exchange it this product sucks and as it was the only one i was using i know thats what caused the swelling	15
0	my fiance' left this bottle of prada on top of her jewelry box and the next time she went to use it it was empty ! ! ! seems the perfume was siphoned up and into the atomizer \( pump sprayer \) and then it all leaked out and down the bottle glueing itself to the jewelry box now we have an empty bottle of prada and a ruined finish on the top of the jewelry box i have sent sephora an email explaining what had happened but have not heard back from them beware of where you keep this bottle ! ! !	15
0	this stuff is the worst smelling conditioner i ever encountered the perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed it took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness i wish i could give it a negative rating i am glad all i used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink	15
0	might be a great product i ca n't be sure because uh hello \? mine did n't come with any instructions whatsover i opened it up and i was like ah hello \? where are the instructions \? but the tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze did not answer my questions if anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions i would greatly appreciate it until then my tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze is just gonna sit there not being used like my box of floss a bag of onions and my heart	15
0	if philosophy makes it for my skin i think i own it i love the microdelivery peel kit which came with 30 of these pads when i bought the set the micro peel is awesome but these pads were disappointing they dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit i have seen no difference since i discontinued using this product seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths	15
0	my experience i heard such great things about prevage restores youthful skin reverses damage etc i could n't wait until it was available finally i was able to buy it nice packaging great dispenser of just the right amount after two months i found it to be only a great under makeup moisterizer and there are plenty of others of equal efficacy for 1 10 the price eucerin for instance kinerase did nothing for me either so it may just be me just fyi fair sensitive dry skin middle aged	15
0	i am asian and i have very thick and coarse hair i bought this product due to all the rave but it did nothing for me and it does n't even smell nice after trying numerous products and flat irons i had thermal reconditioning done my hair has never been smoother silkier and so easily manageable no product or styling necessary just wash and go	15
0	the front material is cheap feeling and grainy also there is a large plastic gold colored cris notti button adorning the front that does not appear in the online picture otherwise it is functionally useful and of good quality	15
0	i use the philosophy 3 in 1 with conditioner it works great and keeps my hair luscious the one time i accidentally bought a 3 in 1 that did n't have conditioner in it my hair dried out after two washes and got horrible split ends after only three applications i had to throw the bottle out i lost more than an inch off the bottom of my hair i do n't understand how their products can vary so widely in quality but they do this is one of their better scents however i would recommend using this as a body wash only	15
0	i ordered this product for my wife 3 weeks before christmas with several other philosophy items they shipped this was backordered i 've sent three messages to them and have not heard a sinlge response terrible aparently customer services is not a philosophy this company subscribes to i have gone ahead and filed a formal complaint through amazon you are probably better off buying their products at a brick and mortar store their online presence is unreliable at best	15
0	i love the scent of this bathbomb but the clean up is annoying noone wants to take a nice bath and then have to get out the tub cleaner afterwards but now i can finally use this bomb again someone advised my to put the bomb in an old nylon to catch the petals this worked fine but took a little away from the whole bath expeirence to have to watch an old nylon float around meif you love the scent then its worth it if its only so so to you move on because this ones a mes	15

0	i was using this thing religiously from my 5th month with coco butter as well i still got stretch marks ba	15
0	i still got the marks iwish it had of helped i used it for a while after giving birth but it did n't help	15
0	i love the cinnamon buns shower gel so i thought i would try the lip gloss for one thing it smells tastes nothing like cinnamon buns i do n't know what the flavor is but i do n't like it maybe they have added almond or something secondly it 's way too sticky my hair kept getting stuck to my lips it reminds me of vaseline since i got this product in a kit i cannot return it but i will not be using it again	15
0	this did nothing for my lashes which are blonde but long so it does n't take all that much it somehow made them look skimpy and clumpy too i discovered diorshow after this and it 's phenominal ! but if you want a very good mascara and do n't want to spend the money i recommend max factor 2000 calorie	15
0	i tried this mascara expecting great things but was very disappointed the mascara seemed dry and it took too long to apply enough so that it even looked like i had lashes \( my natural lashes are almost clear \) back to the drawing board of looking for the holy grail of mascara	15
0	i bought this mascara based on a review i read on amazon maybe it 's just me but i still find that my lashes clump or stick together with this product it might be the navy color i do n't think its worth the extra cost i do just as well with drugstore mascara	15
0	i have been on a search for the perfect mascara for many years now just as many of the reviewers had been i purchased this mascara based on the reviews and i am more than disappointed in the mascara i would not give you 2 cents for the product and would love to return it the mascara is clumpy and will not stick to the eyelash i do not mind paying 25 00 for a tube of mascara if it doe 's the job this one doe 's not i had better luck with max factor clinque etc	15
0	for me it barely looked like i had mascara on at all i have blonde eyelashes so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop and this did n't really i ended up giving it to my mom thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it and she did n't like it either it ended up in the garbage i 've loved dior show mascara and of course great lash i 'd recommend those over this especially for the money	15
0	this perfume is very mediocre one of my friends loved it and on the spur of the moment i decided to give it a try what a waste ! its not unpleasant but so unremarkable that 10 seconds after spraying you forget what it smells like would n't be buying it again	15
0	this product does absolutely nothing it made my face look even more queasy and dry at the same time save your money	15
0	the eyeshadow is n't bad nice color but the packaging was a disappointment the brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you ca n't get very much onto the brush there is no way to open the casing either so its pretty useless i found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also	15
0	very clumpy ! i would never purchase this again it looked like i had one big eyelash they were all clumped together worse one i have ever used	15
0	i thought this was tea holy was i in for a surprise \? did anyone else think this was tea \? it i couldn't get that taste out of my mouth for about four weeks	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	i had never tried anything from philosophy and wanted to try the 3 in 1 stuff and i thought the lavendar pound cake would smell really good i was actually really disappointed it sucks as a shampoo and body wash too i ordered the blueberry pie too and i haven't even used it its just sitting in my closet for the price you get a lot and lasts long but i wasn't impressed	15
0	i usually love the philosophy brand bath and shower gels but this was a major disappointment did n't smell anything like pound cake or lavender for that matter in fact the odor is quite strong and nauseating there are other gels that are great but avoid this one ! phew ! !	15
0	it does n't work for what we intended it for blackhead removal my teen son was really hoping this would help him and it did n't not only that but the safety cap for the lance end does n't stay on	15
0	the company shipping was fine no beefs there the product itself i find to be rather damaging to the skin in order to extract you have to press down extremly hard \( if you can even locate what your attempting to extract w that darn pin hole at the end \) i ca n't imagine this would n't leave scars i would n't reccomend this product i just put it in the drawer never to be used again	15
0	so i 've owned a tweezerman extractor before and i am now questioning why i didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar this extractor is no help what so ever the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that i would press the right pore its just too small to even target the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful you could damage your skin i would recommend not buying this extractor i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman	15
0	the only reason i'm giving this two stars instead of one is because i love benefit that being said this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper it 's so faint that you can hardly smell it but when you do it 's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better if you are looking for a young fun perfume stay away from this one it smells old and drab like your grandmother 's china cabinet or an antique store but if you like that	15
0	maybe i expect too much however even my lowest expectation wasnt met just go ask a dermatologist to help dont waste your money	15
0	i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make up sales representative at nordstrom 's i was less than pleased with the product i used the entire container and saw no benefit ! !	15
0	why is this product advertised here for 100 more than the cost of purchasing it directly from the la mer website	15
0	listen up ! ! ! l'occitane shea 24 hour ultra rich face cream 1 7 ounce has the same moisturizing results for a fraction of the cost ! ! ! \)	15
0	over 1 000 for moisturizing cream \? as the saying goes a fool and their money are soon parted	15
0	a complete waste of money i still have all my stretch mark	15
0	i did n't care for it it smelled good but that 's the only good thing i can say it neither helped or harmed my hair i do n't think i would buy it again	15
0	yikes i was so surprised at the size of the bottle i had no idea it would be that small for the price the scent is nice but i would not reorder	15
0	i bought this with a kit this stuff was just not worth it to me but unlike the others i cannot stand the smell it is very strong and gave me a headache so i could not really leave it on that long my scalp did feel conditioned though but if you are sensitive to strong smells be aware that this stuff may bother you	15
0	what 's the point of this mascara when half the container does n't do what it 's supposed to do \? the black mascara is not good quality it comes off very quickly part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara and the silver stuff the only reason someone would seek out this product is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15

0	beware ! it is a fake not a real genuine mac lipstick do not buy the amplified creme from this seller he has only fakes amplified cremes i got a few	15
0	i work in the cosmetics industry beware this is a copy not a real mac lipstick ! not even close to the formula or color of moxie	15
0	not what i expected ! this shampoo soap ruined the texture of my hair it has no conditioning whatsoever i used the jungle conditioner after the shampoo it is equally hopeless ! it is like the clothes washing soap you get in the villages of india ! a waste of money a lot of false advertising and a lot of hype	15
0	it is true that this product smells absolutely awful after it is applied to the face worse it does absolutely nothing i have been applying a significant amount morning and night for 6 weeks allowing it to soak in and dry it does nothing	15
0	i have been using the product faithfully for several weeks usually twice daily and have not seen any difference in facial brightening i would not repurchase this product	15
0	i 've had excellent luck with tweezerman products in the past but the quality of this blackhead remover was second rate the item consists of a hollow metal tube with two screw in attachments neither attachments really work the threading of both seems to be flawed and to use it as intended would mean to press an unstable attachment against your face no thanks ! my e mailed request for re threading or replacement to tweezerman went unanswered this purchase was an expensive mistake	15
0	i received the vanilla grapefruit sticks as a gift from one of my boys the sticks are very thin and only burn about halfway down the entire length re lighting is useless bc there is no fragrance left at the bottom half of the stick to burn the scent does n't remind me of vanilla grapefruit more like plain burning sticks which wo n't cost you 13 votivo does candles well but the aromatic sticks leave something to be desired not worth the money	15
0	i ordered this product because it was recommended to me on another skincare website however i have n't wanted to use this product much due to it 's odor very medicinal chemical smelling makes me wonder what sort of harsh chemicals are going on my face ! i used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and did n't notice any difference in my skin i would n't recommend this product unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it	15
0	i received my order and was very dissapointed the skin tones online are deceiving i ordered the medium and it appears like clay and ashy does n't blend well with skin suggest you order a darker color to match your skin tone	15
0	i love philosophy products but this shower gel smelled nothing like strawberries more like fluoride treatment for kids i was really bummed out try the cinnamon buns it is so much better	15
0	okay so in the beginning i was so excited about this perfume it smelled amazing and the scent lasted forever when i say forever literally forever you spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep \? it lasts until the next afternoon it 's not even just a weak scent that 's left on you it 's like as if you 've been spraying it constantly but here 's the bad part after using it for awhile i felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong i felt like the scent was a little too deep it 's great for people who like strong distinct scents if not though this is n't the product for you	15
0	there is absolutely nothing special about this leave in conditioner besides the fact that it smells really good however i did n't see any changes in my daughter 's hair after using this conditioner none it is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly otherwise it will run down your face and neck \( wish it came with a spray pump instead \) i was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well known and has a lot of star celebrity power behind it however i found this conditioner to be all hype	15
0	i just received my conditioner today and it 's going back to sephora i do n't know how this can be called a conditioner because it 's nothing more than water it also smells nothing like vanilla the only scent i could smell was coconut and i do n't want my hair smelling like that	15
0	ok so this is the 2nd philosophy product that i 've tried and felt the need to write a review on i have to say this product is far below expectations i sprayed in on and the only thing you smell is the alcohol there seems to be no other notes to it even after you let it settle all you can pick up is alcohol definitely not recommending this product	15
0	i bought this for travel gym bag use when it arrived i opened all bottles and sniffed the frangrace was very masculine smelling i guess this is the yerba mate aroma which is very earthy smelling	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	i bought this stuff because i heard it helped with razor burn my husband likes me to shave a bit more often than i liked well too bad for him ! ! the pain from putting this stuff on was way worse than any sort of razor burn ! no thanks !	15
0	i really do not feel tend skin works as advertised the irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed one good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning tend skin helps for that ! just take a strong whiff and you 'll be alert and ready for your day !	15
0	i used to use tend skin it works ok but there are better things out there now tend skin is an outdated product like the sytptic pencil tend skin stings smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill i recently switched to min solution2 like it much better than tend skin min solution2 has a roller application \( no waste \) organic spearmint \( fresh smell \) and does n't burn like tend skin	15
0	this mascara works great it lengthens separates and defines your lashes and it does n't smudge but it 's so hard to take off ! i used lancome 's bi facil makeup remover which is designed to remove waterproof mascara but it was still hard to remove i lost quite a few lashes in the process i would recommend buying the regular definicils not the waterproof	15
0	i love these products however this particular candle does not have the same intense scent as previous candles i 've purchase	15
0	i should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like lemon pledge it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all i'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room	15
0	this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over it was terribly strong and just not quite what i wanted the company did promptly give me a refund though i suggest you try out demeter fragrances they are more natural smelling	15
0	this product is no better than any regular washcloth and or headband to hold your hair back save your money	15
0	i have tried the lush products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the melt product line any benefits i thought i was getting from lush out the window their products seemed all the sudden unimpressive and i really like that melt is denver based ! try them out and see what you think for yourself \( if you are n't here in colorado i know they have online products too \) and make your own choice i recomend them though and i have told everyone i know to switch !	15
0	when i got this candle i was very excited but when i lit it it seemed to make a scent that strongly smelled of fart when i put it out the fart smell went away	15
0	i bought this for my wife for the holidays it was a bit expensive for a candle but i believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly however in our case after about an hour the candle went out the wick burned too quickly becoming too small and now the candle wo n't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax the return shipping will cost a lot so we will just toss it out waste of money do n't buy one	15
0	try bill 's sliver gripper tweezersi have not purchased any other tweezers since finding bill 's sliver gripper tweezers they are simply the best easiest and most painlessly precise tweezers i have ever owned and amazon has them	15
0	i got very irresistible by givenchy perfume as a gift for christmas as first smell i loved it then i spritzed it and yikes ! that was 2 months ago and i still have the scent on me it 's too flowery it 's not a clean fresh scent more of a i sprayed a little too much potpouri in here scent not for people with mild allergies to perfumes either ! !	15
0	if you 're really looking forward to brightening your blonde go to the salon and ask for a non ammonia hair lightening or use an otc temporary product chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color the expense of this product is not justified by the results and while lush likes to toot its horn about being natural that designation could apply to arsenic it 's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives the parabens	15
0	i'm black and for my hair type 4b i try to use natural products on my hair and it did n't have those no no chemicals and oils that are known to be damaging to black hair well this product did not as it advertised which was to stay put i tried to use it with my hair clean and dry and then with my hair clean and damp and it did nothing both times to hold my comb coils or finger coil in place i did give the product 2 stars because it does smell pretty good sad thing is that i ca n't get my money back i use it as a hair grease for my scalp i hope i 've been helpful	15
0	this brush was not as firm as expected i expected greater quality from the sephora brand however the price of the brush was rather cheap in comparison to finer brushes so in actuality you are getting whay you pay for with this item and nothing more	15
0	it stings burns and irritated my skin didnt prevent any breakouts i bought the whole complex set and this is the one that hurts the most 0 stars if i could need i say more	15
0	i ordered the saturday morning special gift set and tried the tui herbal shampoo right away as with everyone else no lather and lots of tangles after the second wash i decided to use my pantene relaxed and natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair this stuff is a rip off on the plus side it works fabulously on my children 's hair they are bi racial and have naturally curly hair i do n't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair it just does n't work	15
0	this shampoo is just awful it 's greasy and it 's made up of a 90 10 ratio 90 being oil and 10 being soap smells great but leaves your hairl slimy and gross	15
0	maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products however this shampoo did not work for me like the previous reviewer said it was watery and did not lather at all it also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard i followed up with a hair smoothie but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair i do not recommend this at all	15
0	this shampoo is so bad that i thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake it is watery and does not lather my hair felt like it had n't been washed for days and the next day i had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film i never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting 10 00	15
0	all i can say is do not buy this i just got this stuff and used it for the first and last time it smells horrible it left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad i could not even get a comb through it i had to wash my hair \( with a different product of course \) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again what a complete rip off ! ! !	15
0	i have glorious white hair and i thought this would be good for it but it seems to dry my hair too much and frankly i do n't see that it 's any better than the two dollar bottle of suave that 's out there i 've also used lush 's big shampoo and soak 'n' float shampoo bars and i like them much better	15
0	i have to agree with another reviewer this product is not worth the price tag it claims to have a vanilla scent and it does but it is barely noticible do n't buy this product based on how it smells as a moisturizer you can do much better for 23 00	15
0	the shipping was very slow and the product really is n't worth 23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar the product goes on like lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what i expected or wanted i was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer	15
0	like said in an earlier review after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you ca n't see a thing in it in the shower i run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes then you ca n't clear it with any method total waste not worth a dollar	15
0	i love laura mercier 's skin products but her makeup line has these dark cherry burnt orange rasberry colors that just do n't work for fair skin or blonde hair \( which i have \) i wish her colors were better there was only 1 eye color i could wear in this kit and the 3 glow stick things were confusing because they were n't sticks	15
0	as rosey as this oils smells it just is n't as good as the real thing being a fragrance oil it has no medicinal properties i certainly would n't use it on my skin or in a bath ! thanks but no thanks you definitely get what you pay for	15
0	this product was such a waste the little granules made a mess when used as a styling agent for blow drying the hair i will not repurchase it	15
0	i first bought inis cologne in ireland in 2001 and have not used anything else since that time i will go to great lengths to find the cologne i am very glad it is now being offered by amazon	15
0	when i first spray inis energy of the sea cologne spray i could not smell any thing ! then i spray more and more 'till i found out how it smells ! it has nice scent okay i 'll tell you how i found it it is not bad ! but despite that it does n't last for more than half an hour and then it hardly can be smelled you may need to have it with you all the time and spray every half hour this is what disappointed me the most ! i am telling you my taste here that is n't necessarily yours	15
0	i opened my falling in love compact expecting a lovely smell after reading the hype this is the worst smelling perfume ever when i put it on it smelled like burnt clothing like an iron had just done it 's worst on cotton it was so awful i put it straight in the bin	15
0	the description represents a 2 ounce solid fragrance as a lover of all things philosophy i was very disappointed to get something half the size i expected which was 13 ounces ! my 2 stars are only because the fragrance is divine as are they all !	15
0	i was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when i got this soap but sadly that 's not what happened the smell is a very strong herbal like the kind you would add to an italian pasta dish not very appealing ! there is some complexity to the scent but it 's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through on the plus side the color is beautiful \( a rich dark purple \) and the lather is equally lovely to look at if you like true herbal scents then you should give this a try it just was n't for me	15
0	love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product ! well this one used to have about 3 five star ratings i added my two cents this product did nothing for me whatsoever so some people love it i do n't get it and it 's pretty much the opposite of an anti oxidant so that does n't make sense i pointed this out in my review wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough \? also it 's listed at 45 on amazon as well from the same supplier huh	15
0	i bought this from sephora it left my hair a greasy mess and i have dry coarse hair it was very greasy and did n't rinse out well at all	15
0	i can truly say that this products does n't work i have silky wavy fine hair and i am a hair food junkie so i used a lot of things but this do n't work usually anything can tame my hair but all this conditioner do is make it hard matted and tangled carol daughter 's products may work for some but it has n't work for anyone in my family and we all have different hair textures	15
0	happy has a really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins it is like cheap colognes	15
0	i ordered the gift set and it came as advertised very cute package unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast \( that i could find \) so i could not test it it is far too strong a scent even the lotion the candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes my advice find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing	15
0	i should have known better people were telling me to use dermaaction from www topicalbeauty com but i wasted my money on hylexin instead saw no results dermaaction on the other hand is making a huge change in my skin and my eyes look way better now next time i 'll listen	15
0	i really wanted this to work i have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else but i 've been using this twice a day for two months and i have n't noticed any improvement at all not even a little in fact my eyes might actually look worse it has not faded the dark circles nor has it improved the bags	15
0	i fell for the hype and now am out quite a bit of money save your money trust me ! i used this product 2 3 times a day until the entire tube was gone \( took several months \) and saw no change whatsoever ! i have serious dark circles which is what it claims to help i am very disappointed with this company and their product and will never buy any item with their name on it again ! what a bunch of crap btw look at all the reviews this product is listed in several places here ! !	15
0	after i ordered this product one of my co workers told me about the reviews on amazon i checked it out and i was really surprised ! the reviews are poor the worst part though is that the product is listed three times ! ! what 's the deal \? \? a product gets a bad review so they re list it more bad reviews and they re list it again ! see for yourself do a general search for hylexin and you will see several listings of the same product trying to out run bad reviews \? \? \? \? i now think less of the product and amazon shame on you both	15
0	this stuff is very expensive and i 've diligently used it as the directions state i havent seen growth i am actually losing more eyelashes ! ! i was going to buy the mascara if i grew the eyelashes but it does n't seem to be working sigh	15
0	the click stick applicator is ridiculous you have no control over the shadow when you click it nothing comes out you have to twist about ten times and then suddenly a huge blob enough for eighteen applications comes busting out the only way i 've found to apply this is to use my own shadow brush dipped in this huge blob i purchased three colors at the same time and all three tubes work in this same way as far as the actual shadow it 's fine nothing spectacular you could get the same product from wet'n wild for a buck	15

0	i paid 100 00 for a tube of hylexin because i have serious dark circles unfortunately i fell for the hype because i would have tried anything that says significantly reduces dark circles ! i followed the directions and waited nothing ! i teach business ehtics at a university part of the course involves ethics in advertising i use the hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording the packaging etc please take my word for it and save yourself some money	15

0	okay but does not keep cool for long i do like the massage effect from the beads	15
0	until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave ins it made my dry curly hair soft shiny and smelling great ! but lately something has changed the once thick silky liquid has turned thin and watery with a distinctly alcohol like smell it 's so disappointing this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book do n't bother with it anymore unless the original formula comes back	15
0	in all honesty i 'd rate the fragrance itself as 5 stars however the scent does not last for love nor money which is why i give it a mere 1 star you 'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and consequently before you know it you 've depleted your perfume ! talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and if they 're honest they will tell you exactly what i 've written here because i adore the scent i'm going to try the baby phat goddess body lotion and see if that has a lingering effect	15
0	ive had this product for the past 2 weeks and it does not do what it claims to do i still have to reapply makeup and it still smudges of	15
0	i think this product would be great but was n't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy 's website does't give you one tiny bit of information the very last step the very last sentence says that you should n't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout the reason i bought this was to clear up my face so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin	15
0	this did n't do anything for me is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect \? i am returning it i'm really surprised others had such great results because i tried it twice and left it on for double the time and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream it does have more than baking soda and h2o2 also contains catalase some stearic acid and some vitamin c of course your skin already has its own catalase	15
0	this is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda which would cost the average person about 3 dollars	15
0	i 've read so many positive reviews about this and i wanted to buy it so very much but when i got around to actually smell it i was so dissapointed i can only smell an old lady perfume a bug spray i do n't know something so strong and not strong in the right way my favourites are dior j'adore red delicious intuition \( estee lauder \) try them instead if you want to feel sexy and powerful	15
0	small thin fragile not worth the five dollars find a better product from another company	15
0	i got my bottle of curve today and tried it out my girlfriend said i smelled like dust oops ! too bad they do n't have scratch and sniff on the computer	15
0	the product has made my skin much worse than when i started i am so sorry i even kept at it ! ! \( how can i reverse all the damage now that murad has given me	15
0	this dryed my skin out really bad and it did n't even work dont use this	15
0	this product should be listed only for people with really oily skin it dried my combination skin out so bad that it got red flaky and it hurt ! i also got horrible pimples all over my face due to over drying this is actually harsher than proactive unless your skin covered in oil it probably wont be able to handle it good luck getting your refund i'm still waiting for mine i also cancelled the shipments twice and they keep charging me and sending them	15
0	i really wanted to like this one but just could n't get past the smell it was really over powering lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this is n't one of them i did n't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely it was just too strongly scented for my liking	15
0	i generally love lush soaps but do not recommend this one demon in the dark has a great name but it does n't smell very good \( a sort of faint slightly minty scent \) it also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off but must be removed for the soap to work properly i would try red rooster or karma soap instead	15
0	i'm in my 30 's light skin everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try did n't work for me after using it for a while i had break outs and my skin became greasy it 's not what they say it is i 've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is amazing grace for your body but the skin care products are a scam go for neutrogena or clinique good luc	15
0	ick i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that i used to love by loreal smell fake grade school grape aid smell grossed me out feel i like lip gloss that feels glossy this stuff did not shine enough or last long enough color the color was to mild for me i was very disappointed i felt like i had wasted money and time i still recommend loreal lip juice though i believe it 's the same company and lip juice is glossy shiny long lasting and way more cost effective	15
0	i had very high hopes for this cream as it appears they went the extra mile for quality not so the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face making for some tense moments that should not be there i have used many creams so far art of shaving is the best casswell massey is ok as is aveda avoid truefitt update trufitt and hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems they sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as massey it is good the standard is still substandard	15
0	i thought the product arrived in a timely manner the instructions were clear but it 's hard to hold the stencils and put on your eyebrow at the same time not a bad product for the price	15
0	i received this as a christmas gift and loved the smell of it after my second time using it i broke out in a terrible itchy rash there is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin the smell is great but is gone after you get out of the shower	15
0	i have worked with two women who have worn this perfume and frankly i ca n't stand the smell of it it does n't even smell like perfume it is like some bizarre animal musk there are no floral notes and no woodsy notes either nothing clean or fresh or pleasant i wish this perfume did n't exist i hate it	15
0	i had such high hopes for this product i thought it was going to be the perfect scent for me as it turns out that could n't be futher from the truth it smells like cheap old lady perfume yuck to top it all off they raised the price of it by 5 dollars ! ! talk about inflation ouch !	15
0	when i think of an almond cookie i think of something sweet especially given the description of this product the smell of almond is so overpowering its all i can smell i did n't catch vanilla or sandalwood i 've already returned my products	15
0	i ordered this item all of your information indicated that it was in stock the company shipped another product instead the mirror i wanted was out of stock i never received any information so i ended up paying more from another vendor and still did n't have the mirror for christmas i am so disappointed with amazon and bebeautiful	15
0	i have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer i used just a little bit and it was really greasy i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum it works much better	15
0	i would n't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself after using this so called instant detangler my hair was more tangled then ever in my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job	15
0	i was very unhappy with this product first the shipping took way too long second the tube is much smaller than sold at macy 's and the cost is more and the contents were gross very goopy not smooth like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months i 'll fight the mall to buy this next time	15
0	i love love love lipglass normally but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go go dancer	15
0	it only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is not the solution for ending blackheads enlarged pores using this extractor is equal to using one 's fingers to squeeze out imperfections which may produce very temporary results but is ultimately fruitless those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep cleaning instead which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation	15

0	i used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend my face esp my forehead became very greasy and every pore on my forehead became inflamed i thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina my face cleared up instantly when the aquamarina ran out i went back to herbalism but surprise the skin problems reemerged now i'm using aquamarina instead and love it though you ca n't get it through amazon for some reason check the lush website i'm sure this wo n't happen to everyone but give that pink glop a try instead	15
0	disappointingly this tape did not perform as well as hoped it was unable to hold medium or heavier weight fabrics in place using a one inch piece under bra straps did not keep them from slipping the tape and straps eventually started rolling and it definitely was unable to help prevent a strapless bra from succumbing to newton 's law of gravity ! so not only did fashion faux pas continue to occur the tape caused a rash skin irritation with each use	15
0	if you have some respect for your nose please do n't buy these wipes ! ! ! i bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house ! ! ! and i would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby	15
0	these wipes have more perfume in them than any wipe on earth they are about the same softness as the kirkland brand but cost a lot more and wooohoooo they smell stronger than este lauder herself	15
0	at 23 i do n't have age wrinkles around my eyes but i have laugh lines that i want to soften this product has done nothing for my laugh lines i could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines this product did not	15
0	i was talked into buying this product for minor fine lines this product that i used for 4 months showed no signifigant results as well as any other product ive used by estee lauder dont waste your money on it i usually look at it like this if any cosmetic retailer offer a free gift with purchase it usually needs one to go with it this product is crap !	15
0	that 's the drawback of buying a new thing on the internet because you can not feel or smell it i bought the whole set as i am a sandalwood fanatic i could n't have been more disappointed this thing whatever it is does not smell like sandalwood a complete waste of money	15
0	why did shiseido have to ruin a good idea with a sub par spf \? they got the broad spectrum part correct by using avobenzone as the active sunscreen ingredient but then came up far short to the widely preferred spf 15 uva uvb spf 15 or more is a standard widely recommended by dermatologists the skin cancer foundation the american academy of dermatology and others plus as a moisturizer this one is just ok there are far better formulations on the market even some made by shiseido containing not only a better daily sunscreen but antioxidents and better moisturizing ingredients	15
0	although this worked well on some of my blackheads i felt it was very harsh to my skin i was worried that using it would create even more scars i would not buy this product again	15
0	used daily for 3 months minimal improvement in dark circles zero improvement in lines around eye area \( i am 35 years old \) i hope this is not the best product out there	15
0	i bought tendskin to help with the irritation and razor bumps i get on my neck from shaving the product claims to reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps ingrown hairs and redness from shaving but despite it 's lofty promises and high price it does none of this in fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse i have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol the directions tell you to apply it after shaving but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving it only made my problem worse i wish i could have rated this product zero stars because it is absolutely worthless	15
0	i used tend skin for a few years and it was the best one that i could find but a few weeks ago i saw a nother product on amazon called solution 2 and ordered it instead i was a little worried because i was getting good results with the bumps with tend skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps	15
0	for medium length hair it lasted about 4 uses smells way funky ca n't say i noticed anything different just did n't feel that it warrants the hype	15
0	i think i may have had a bad batch because when i read the reviews on how yummy it had smelled made me curious so i tried it and i hated it ! the smell of it turned my stomach it did soften my hair a bit but i do n't recommend using it again sorry lush	15
0	let me just say that i have thick dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp and this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess it dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage the smell was really good at first very coconuty but then after a few uses it developed a weird scent like playdoh and pepper so i just used up the rest of it as regular soap it has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars	15
0	i was really excited for this ! i hoped it would be a faster easier way to do make up and what not but its not it smears like crazy and the end is so sharp it hurts to apply but that does n't matter ! the end stops working after a use or two i suppose if you wanted to do make up similar to a raccoon with blueish eyes \( for the black is more navy then black \) you 'll be happy i 've always loved the mark products but this is a disappointment	15
0	this stuff has great shine but it dries my lips and it starts peeling and uber sticky	15
0	at first it smells very sharp and citrusy almost like men 's cologne then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal after 15 minutes you wo n't be able to smell it at all very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag you 'd be better off buying a bottle of herbal essence shower gel and getting identical results	15
0	i bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair sensitive skin which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation this product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face hands etc it did not irritate her skin at all the problem the one and only problem is the fragrance if you can call it that it stinks so bad i did not want to go near her after i wiped her down i had to give her a bath it was so bad	15
0	the beads in this ice pack do not get cold at all it gets a little cold but warms up in about 45 seconds i also noticed very little over all effects from using it	15
0	i ordered the fedora i am so dissapointed it came off within a few hours ! just peeled right off do not order this brand of fingernail polish it is the worst i have ever used	15
0	i have to write in caps because i am so irritated i have tried 5 different carol's hair products and none including this one has worked not only that the smells aren't all that great and they scream it's like people who wear bad perfume that's extremely strong but smells horrible they think it smells good but it disgust everyon	15
0	was n't anything special you can go to any beauty supply store and get a similar oil that 's half the price	15
1	i bought the shampoo theory and condition theory and this redo freshen up mist i have normal type hair that needs to be washed every other day and if i use a lot of product it needs to be washed every day i have very sensitive skin too this mist worked very well on my hair definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry and it feels awesome on my skin well done jonathan	15
1	if jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products the aquasana shower filter is an excellent product which i use whats it matter who 's name is on it it is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher	15
1	i love jonathan products and especially how it makes my hairfeel so soft and sexy looking keep up the good work jonathan	15
1	finish firm hold spray is absolutely perfect for my needs it has a firm hold yet is n't heavy or hard i do n't have a complicated hair style but my hair tends to go flat after just a few hours this product prevents that	15
1	very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair i can tell it has made a difference	15
1	it 's the best product i 've used to create volume and hold i did n't notice it after blow drying but while using the curling iron and styling my hair had a lot more volume and great hold i have straight fine limp hair and it is very difficult to get it to hold a style i truely noticed a big difference i plan to purchase the other volumizing products once they are in stock	15
1	i have tried just about every hair product on the market and this very much surpassed my expectations ! i was n't sure when i put it in my hair but as i was styling it i was amazed it created a lot of volume and my hair stayed shiny i am ready to try the rest of the product line	15
1	this works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry i have long hair and i love using this product it works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life fantastic	15
1	its pretty expensive for gel but i like it my hair does n't get rock hard like other gels and holds pretty well throughout the day	15
1	its good for waking up because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire i like the sting and the shine of it it finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips but i think it 's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips this stuff is strong did i mention the great smell \? yum ! me and my boyfriend loved it	15
1	i just got this item \( from ebay it 's cheaper \) and feel it 's worthy of praise i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair i have n't figured out how it curls but to wave it 's incredibly easy ! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w o burning your hair like a curling iron would also w a curling iron it 's difficult to wave the top close to the roots it heats fast ! and comes w a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools	15
1	t3 is worth every penny it is very easy to handle my hair is soft and shiny no more frizz it cut straightening time to half no hair pulling and it is lightweight plus 2 years of warranty hellooo ! ! ! bye bye chi	15
1	i thought i was just going to have to put up with fly away hair the rest of my life this product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it it 's serious taming for seriously stubborn coarse or frizzy hair mine falls into the first two categories do n't use too much ! i use it after i 've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair even combing it gently in to reach every strand for the first time in years my razor cut layered hair is smooth	15
1	like any other leave in creme conditioner anything if you put too much of it on it will attract dirt i know this because i have baby fine hair and had to model in the dry dry deserts in the middle of summer needed anything leave in to keep my staticy hair down yes the more you use to more dirty you get \( but in photos you ca n't really see this but it felt nasty ! \) so wash your hair well condition towel dry apply sparingly like a touch and smooth into hair it 's not rocket science if you need a little more later add a little more	15
1	high beam is a nice subtle highlighter however be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting \( it 'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face \) it also has a tendency to emphasize pores so only use it on areas of your face where you do n't have any like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows	15
1	high beam provides a glow or sheen where as my cheeks seem dull it does not look greasy i would say it makes the skin look healthy and vibrant	15
1	this dry iron is absolutely amazing i really ca n't say enough about it great for all types of hair ! it heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time plus your hair comes out extremely straight highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours it is an investment in your hair one of the better ones i 've made	15
1	i absolutely love this hairbrush ! i have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now i have not been impressed with any brushes this brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck you will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer \( the featherweight \) ! oh another thing i like is it extremely easy to keep clean	15
1	its pretty expensive for gel but i like it my hair does n't get rock hard like other gels and holds pretty well throughout the day	15
1	its good for waking up because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire i like the sting and the shine of it it finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips but i think it 's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips this stuff is strong did i mention the great smell \? yum ! me and my boyfriend loved it	15
1	as a lip gloss addict i have easily over 200 glosses too faced fat kiss is by far one of my favorites the superb shine makes my lips look so good ! although it does n't really plump it still tastes like cinnamon and it will warm you up in winter i have two different colors because i like it so much ! i strongly reccomend getting a couple so you can keep them in your purse make up bag car everywhere ! this rocks sooo much	15
1	very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair i can tell it has made a difference	15
1	this is the second product of jonathan 's i 've used and i'm equally happy with it i have thin hair when it 's straight and something in the middle when it 's curly either way i 'd like it thicker and this foam certainly helps it 's great and i 've found it does what it promises it smells good and you do n't need to use too much it feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day it does n't matter if your hair is curly or straight hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as i have	15
1	it has a clean soap smell ! i also recommend the volume shampoo conditioner it made my hair feel very soft	15
1	i just got this item \( from ebay it 's cheaper \) and feel it 's worthy of praise i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair i have n't figured out how it curls but to wave it 's incredibly easy ! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w o burning your hair like a curling iron would also w a curling iron it 's difficult to wave the top close to the roots it heats fast ! and comes w a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools	15
1	i have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks i love this product ! no build up no dandruf make sure your hair is wet not just damp and you should not have a lathering problem i purchased this from qvc and i will definately be a repeat customer i have short hair so this will last me a while i loved it so much i bought some for my daughter this is my new shampoo	15
1	i love the benefit line everything i have tried works great \( not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products ! \) that said high beam is simply amazing it only takes a little dab to add a nice glow shimmer to my face i especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow high beam works so much better for me than other products i 've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky not to mention those other products cost a lot more ! if you are looking for a little glow a little shimmer high beam is the answer	15
1	high beam provides a glow or sheen where as my cheeks seem dull it does not look greasy i would say it makes the skin look healthy and vibrant	15
1	i recently discovered benefit products this is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin i use it to highlight my cheek bones you can use it any where you want a glance to linger the best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin i suggest you try this product it works wonders	15
1	this dry iron is absolutely amazing i really ca n't say enough about it great for all types of hair ! it heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time plus your hair comes out extremely straight highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours it is an investment in your hair one of the better ones i 've made	15
1	i am a big fan of this product my hair is very strong it needs a product which can keep it tamed however most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which in my opinion is a bad look for today 's fashions the matte look is more flexible american crew fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold it also smells nice not to strong and not too girly	15
1	i have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head the results are great no unwated shine no gooiness very easy to wash off your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged reasonably priced and more available every day	15
1	this is a great product for getting the bed head look i can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild ! trust me the results are great if you apply too much you 're hair will get oily the good thing is that this product washes out easily with any shampoo	15
1	this stuff is great i used to buy new gels pommades pastes etc every month because i could never find one that worked exactly how i wanted it to but i first tried this a year ago and it 's all i 've used since and it lasts a long time so do n't be afraid of the price one container lasts me about 6 months so you only have to buy it twice a year i 'll be ordering my third order of it soon	15
1	this works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry i have long hair and i love using this product it works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life fantastic	15
1	this is a great idea for a product ! for those of you who do n't wash your hair every day this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you do n't wash it i used this after 5 days without washing and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful ! well done	15
1	i bought the shampoo theory and condition theory and this redo freshen up mist i have normal type hair that needs to be washed every other day and if i use a lot of product it needs to be washed every day i have very sensitive skin too this mist worked very well on my hair definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry and it feels awesome on my skin well done jonathan	15
1	i got a sample of this conditioner when i bought a similar product by another company i did n't care for the one i purchased but the sample was awesome and i am going to buy the jonathan conditioner i have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products i used this for a week and this is the only thing i have ever seen any kind of difference with i love it !	15
1	its effect very much depends on the climate you live in if you live in a colder and dry climate especially during winter it does exactly as it promises great moisturizer lines are diminished as is puffiness i really love using it i am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate but in hot and sometims humid climates or during summer it just does n't work as well i do n't know why i like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle although i am using it as a seasonal eye care	15
1	i could n't say if this diminished wrinkles or puffyness but it 's fab for great feeling eyes the whole area is velvety smooth and skin feels as soft as silk	15
1	i never wanted to waste my money on a manicure because my polish would be chipping peeling by the next day my pedicurist bet me that she could keep the polish on my manicure by using this stuff and low and behold it worked ! it kept the polish on for a week even through housecleaning and a trip to vegas	15
1	sounds like a pitch but something about benefits sharpeners has obviously been designed better to sharpen without the usual amount of waste these are all i can use anymore	15
1	cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance that certainly is chanel no 22 it 's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of chanel no 5 coco chanel and ernest beaux developed yet another fragrance naming it no 22 for the year it was presented it may have been created in 1922 but it 's as up to the minute as tomorrow especially in the new spray	15
1	i have always used what i thought the best skin products but after using relastin for only a few weeks i was pleasantly surprised to see how amazingly this product has revitalized my skin ! at this point i am sold out to relastin and will only use this product	15
1	i 've been wearing makeup to some degree or another for over 30 years and i 've never ever found foundation as good pure non irritating glow y or simply as perfect as bare minerals i truly believe it cleared up my adult acne within a month that i started using it i just ordered this kit and i'm confident it will perform as well as the other products i have by this company do n't waste your on the imitators everyone 's jumped on the mineral makeup bandwagon now but this original line is hands down the best	15
1	love the bare escentuals line of products not one for makeups to begin with this allows me to even out my skin tone give vibrance and is good for the skin have never had any skin problems with this line and believe me my skin is sensitive	15
1	i 've been using strivectin sd for almost two years there is n't a day that goes by that i do n't get a complement on my skin i do n't wear any make up aside from lipstick my skin alway glows and the fine lines are hardly visible i'm in the beauty business and i recommend this product to my customers i am not a spokesperson for the company only a happy and satisfied customer	15
1	i 've gotten a few compliments on it by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent moreso than the big bottles i bought the 50 one and i do like it but i think it 's gonna take me awhile to finish it so from now on i 'll buy the 1 7 oz first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent but overall very fresh and sweet smelling	15
1	obviously some people do n't care about reviewing an item just about bashing a pop artist that does n't deserve it anyway i think it smells great obviously it does or it would n't be the bestselling perfume right now but do n't take my word for it go to your nearest store and give it a sniff also be sure to check out fantasy i think it smells even better	15
1	i 've tried all types of eyeliner and they all end up smudging or flaking off very messy by the end of a long day \( or night \) i bought this one to wear at my wedding \( in the fantastic chocolate shade \) and it was absolutely perfect ! well worth the price great wear easy to apply \( with a very skinny tipped brush i ended up using a tiny paintbrush \) and stays exactly where you put it	15
1	this scent is so clean and not over powering ! i love this product ! it lasts too ! there 's really no need to reapply	15
1	i was very pleased with this purchase the perfume arrived packaged nicely and was actually bigger than i expected 1 oz to be i love the scent and will definately buy more when this one is gone ! great experience with amazon	15
1	i have always loved happy but i love my happy heart ! i wear it 99 of the time my guy loves the smell too and i often get comments that it smells wonderful not too strong just enough \) i 'd recommend this perfume to everyone young and old	15
1	i may be the only woman alive who does n't like happy but i love heart ! it 's a perfect fragrance not too strong but not too light it 's very feminine	15
1	this is probably one to keep away from the kids it smells good enough to eat and its frothy whipped consistency makes it even more tempting ! it 's a bit pricey but it lathers up really well i found that about a teaspoon full on my loofah was more than enough for my shower and it just smells amazing ! very refreshing and a definite mood lifter now i want to try the whipped body delight in this scent	15
1	the flavor and scent are great ! i continue to smell the sugar scent for a while after applying and it lasts on my lips for a long time it 's a nice shiny look but does n't go overboard	15
1	this lip gloss smells good goes on slick and stays on a long time great value for the price i love philosophy products they 're all great	15
1	i read many positive \( and very few negative \) reviews before i ordered my first tube i am 65 living in florida and have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months the cream goes on smoothly and i have had no negative reaction friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking with less wrinkles in fact two friends based on my favorable experience are also planning to purchase kinerase	15
1	foams nicely in the tub rinses away cleanly skin is n't left with any film instead your skin is left very soft and with a good scent falling in love smells sweet and relaxing and makes me think of cotton candy the large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower	15
1	i must say that i have been really impressed with this product i tend to have skin that is combo oily which results in occasional pimples here and there not really acne but annoying blackheads and bumps i had been using something else similar to this with ok results however within just 2 days of beginning this i noticed immediate results my breakouts have been a non event and even if i get a pimple here or there it 's gone in a day i 've even noticed a drastic improvement in those hard to eliminate blackheads my skin feels much smoother and my pores look better i do n't see how i could ever be without this	15
1	this is the only blemish treatment that i have ever tried that will get rid of anything ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down you can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up it isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though it is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face it 's a little pricey but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year	15
1	this powder is great it has great coverage without looking cakey i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched up a little more often than other powders i 've tried but it 's worth it	15
1	i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it in beige i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage fast shippin	15
1	this being my first badger brush i do n't know how competent a reviewer i can be but i am really happy with it it is large enough to hold a lot of foam \( sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much \) it is fairly heavy and robust which i also like i 've been using it for about 6 months now and have a feeling that it is going to last for years make sure to hang it to dry and wash it thoroughly after each use for anybody who is new to the wonderful world of shaving with a brush i highly recommend this page as a intro	15
1	i have been using strivectin sd eye cream for one month i am 30 and have no wrinkles but some uneven skin tone so i cannot comment on wrinkle restoration my goal is prevention however i have a small unsightly broken blood vessel underneath one eye that i have had for 10 years applying strivectin 2x per day has diminished the appearance significantly in just 4 weeks i am of course hopeful that it will disappear completely with continued use i never expected that the broken blood vessel could be treated topically and i was thinking of having a laser treatment \( a bit scary though near the eye ! \) i am thrilled with the cream and will stick with it	15
1	laura mercier cosmetics are a bit like bon bons you ca n't have just one she makes it easy for us with her eye color duos 2 compatible eye shadow colors in one mirrored compact while there are five appealing color combinations all fresh and sheer my current favorites are moss and azure with two colors one light and one dark i have a veritable palette of possibilities each can be used alone or together with one shading under the brow and the other on the lid or the colors can be mixed for a completely different effect colors are intensified by a second or third application \( a sponge tipped swab is very effective for this \) merci mercier !	15
1	i want one in every color it glides on very smooth and the color lasts	15
1	i ca n't even begin to explain how much i love this product although teen age acne is long gone for me like most women at that certain time of the month i get a little flair up here and there this product is great totally takes the red out and i say speeds the healing process as well i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when i saw the begingings of one ones i caught early on never really turned into full blown acne yes it 's pricey but i think it 's worth every penny	15
1	if you are like me and get the occasional zit when you least expect it then this works out well it will not remove the zit but it will cover the nasty monster pretty well ! ! i put it under my lancome powder and it really made a difference because it is clear it will blend in with whatever foundation or powder you use oh yes and it covers all the redness that comes with those nasty zits a girls new best friend	15
1	if you 're like me you get the occasional zit at the most inopportune time benefit 's boo boo zap ! is a bit spendy for such a small amount \( about the size of a small tube of lipstick \) but it does help while it wo n't erase the zit overnight it will get the red out you can dab some on under or over makeup too because it goes on clear not tinted definitely worth a try	15
1	i used this product in the evening and noticed immediate plumping i also use lipfusion xl \( 50 00 \) but sometimes the results are not long lasting when i used the too faced lip injection mask the results were immediate and seemed to continue for hours when i woke in the morning my lips were very plumped much more so than with lip fusion alone i will use these products together the lip injection mask from too faced is amazing ! used first then with lip fusion xl layered on top after rinsing off the mask it seriously looked like i had undergone medical procedure lip plumping ! i highly reccommend this lip injection mask	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	i am 51 and recently visited an upscale retail store in manhattan the yves st laurent gal behind the cosmetic counter noticed my complexion was a little sallow put this product about an inch on each side of my nose and blended it in what a difference it made a worthwhile investment i use it under my eyes and just about all over my face for a nice touch up concealer and brightener covers freckles and sun spots too	15
1	awesome product best concealer i 've ever used it is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye creases that my almost 50 year old eyes have the pink undertone brightens and lightens	15
1	my wife bought this lipstick in spain and was happy to find that she could purchase it in the u s also it 's the perfect color for her and does n't smudge	15
1	this is a great product however i would like to know if its organic a very good value too	15
1	i 've used paris hilton perfume for about a year now ordering it online at amazon was terrific i did n't have to drive and the price is half the amount you would spend in the department store ! ! ! if you have n't tried this fragrance please do so you will be wonderfully surprised at how special it makes you feel ! donna	15
1	this paris hilton perfume is wonderful i got it 2 months ago in september as one of my birthday presents from my mum i 'd heard of the paris hilton perfume a while back but i thought it would n't be that good however a few days before my birthday my mum brought home a tester and i was really shocked the perfume smells delicous every time i have it on i get tons of compliments it really is a gorgeous scent perfect for night and day i have had a lot of perfumes in my life some of them really expensive but this is by far the best ever i would recommend this to anyone	15
1	very rich a little heavy though can cause buildup but still excellent quality	15
1	this is awesome for thick curly hair apply when wet and it absorbs and keeps you moisturized for days also good with shea butter to 'slick smooth' edges for a ponytail	15
1	i absolutely love this product ! it 's been effective on both my natural and now permed hair it 's worth the price i have n't found anything on the market to match it yet	15
1	this product will not work for everyone it 's not really for people with straight fine hair it 's formulated to target mostly women of color who have tightly curled thick natural hair i apply about a nickle size of this stuff to the ends of my hair before i style it it leaves my hair soft manageable and conditioned eliminating breakage so that it can grow long and healthy the aroma is a little too earthy for my personal taste but i can handle that as long as the natural ingredients work i give it 5 stars	15
1	i love this product it has healed my brittle hair after being bleached one too many times i use it every day and it not only heals and conditions my hair but it holds my style in place as some people mentioned it can make your hair greasy you have to make sure to massage it into your hair and only use a little	15
1	i liked this product so much i'm buying some for my family members who live out of town ! only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft shiny and moisturized and it 's great on my ends especially with roller sets ! plus my darling hubby loves the scent i use it along with the khoret amen hair oil	15
1	this product is fantastic ! i use it for my daughter who has very thick beautiful and coarse hair ! it tames her enough so it is not unmanageable and leaves it shiny and soft this works well with the hair balm ! !	15
1	i have tried many face cleaners murad acne clarifying cleanser and it is great murad acne clarifying cleanser has a nice scent and leaves my face feeling tingly clean without dry it out murad acne clarifying cleanser helps control my acne and i would recommend murad to anyone who needs help with acne	15
1	this oil smells so good i just love it all of my friends say i smell so good	15
1	i have very thick hair i stopped relaxing it one year ago and felt it was not very easy to manage i found the kerastase shampoo and combined it with the smoothing mask and my hair became much more easy to manage ! now i can comb through it as soon as the conditioner is rinsed	15
1	my significate other bought the shampoo for me i use the hair butter and various other products from carol 's daughter i was very fortune to actually make it to the store in new york i have very short barber style hair and the scent drives people wild i will continue to buy these products if you like the fruity tuttie smells and your hair grease non petroleum based carol 's daughter is for you	15
1	this is a wonderfully light sunscreen that makes my face feels very smooth definitely worth the money ! if you do buy this product make sure you apply it over your moisturizer otherwise it will flake when it dries	15
1	this is an excellent product but i have a problem disguising the white look it leaves on my face at first i thought it was because i used too much but even when i use only a tiny amount it is still white it will certainly suit persons with pale complexions wish there was a tint to it	15
1	if you want an spf that is strong light non greasy and does n't smell this is definitely it i am addicted and will never use anything else	15
1	i absolutely love this scent i originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much i bought the lotion the scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell i have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells if you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you 'll love this	15
1	i 've been using city lips for the past 6 months and i absolutely love it ! i especially love the moisturizing effect i used to have to use chapstick constantly but now i never use it my lips now are always soft and moisturized and fuller !	15
1	citylips has made my lips larger ! i love the clear i use it all day long i will buy this product again	15
1	when i first tried this perfume it reminded very much of victoria 's secret pink it had that same distinctly sweet strongly scented unique floral note yet here the bouquet was significantly softer sweeter it would work well for someone who likes a sweet girly scent that is light yet still pronounced the one drawback is that the staying power is poor i could n't detect any trait of this just a few hours later this is a bit disappointing give the high price yet this still might be a good choice for someone who is looking for an everyday fragrance and does n't mind having to reapply	15
1	i absolutely fell in love with this fragrance it smells like a day at the county fair absolutely lovely you have to layer it though to make it last wash with the shower gel put on the body lotion first thing when you get out of the shower or bath \( perfumes stick better that way while you 're moist \) and then spray if you wash your hair spray while your blow drying it out carry the spray in your purse you will need to touch up during the day	15
1	i was afraid of this fragrance in the bottle since it smelled like carmelized sugar to me i tried the shower gel first loved it had to try the perfume everyone loves it ! my friend even asked if she could copy me and wear it too ! of course i said yes everyone needs a little love ! we both agree to spritz a little extra on if you want others to smell it it goes on very light an extra spritz is not obnoxious with this scent	15
1	this scent is truly intoxicating i have tried various perfumes like arpege evelyn rose and j'adore but there was always something missing flower by kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance it has the elegance of arpege sensuality of evelyn rose and classiness of j'adore this product line also have matching deoderant so not to clash with the perfume how nice is that ! it is not too strong either but lasts for a long time i have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good	15
1	i have to admit i'm a very picky perfume shopper but flower by kenzo is amazing is light flowery elegant casual truly wonderful	15
1	i have only used clinique eye shadows and have been so happy with them i 've tried different brands and always come back to this one they have great colors and it lasts all day without creasing or looking too powdery	15
1	this product really does feel like silk out of all the eye products i really like this one i would recommend it !	15
1	love this scent definately not too strong and it seems to last quite a while perfect for everyday wear it has a strong undertone of vanilla so if that 's not your bag i would n't recommend it	15
1	im really sorry about my review below my friend did it without me knowing off my accout im really sorry	15
1	i wish it smelled more of cinnamon and less of clove but that 's just me i'm not a huge clove fan but it worked great made my hair scalp feel awesome will definitely buy this again and i ca n't wait to try other lush products	15
1	i love this shampoo it make my hair so soft and shiny i cut the shampoo in four and use it every other day then i keep it at dry place this shampoo last long too the smell is great too love it ! i'm going to buy it for my mom	15
1	i just bought this the other day having owned the regular sized kabuki brush i find i like the baby buki better it still gives great coverage just in a more compact size which i love	15
1	my title says it all this smells so amazing and is such a lush and fabulous lather that i will never wash with any other soap again i even bought the perfume because i found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower it 's fantastic it 's totally worth the money and it lasts a long time one bottle lasts me 2 3 months bathing every day i 've even used this in my hair before but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and i need a lot of moisture because i have blonded curly hair	15
1	the kerastase line is hard to find \( used to be only sold in kerastase salons i believe \) the shampoos do exactly what they say in this case this is a moisturizing shampoo for dried hair that may be overly chemically treated i only wish they came in larger bottles	15
1	i have straight hair and this products makes my hair insanely smooth and beautiful the smell is strong but i like it though everyone wo n't use very little of the restorative treatment or your hair will be very oily	15
1	i use renergie microlift active redefining treatment as a preconditioner prior to the placement of foundation on my face i cannot imagine using anything else i find it challenging to find a product that allows my foundation to go on silky smooth yet without feeling greasy or causing blemishes i am in my fourties and this is the best product i have found	15
1	great salt scrub and it really does get warm on contact and leaves skin baby sooofft	15
1	everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received	15
1	this product is the best of this type i 've ever used i would recommend it	15
1	this is the best concealer i have ever worn it covers well without making me look fake or cakey around the eyes not greasy either the powder that comes with this is a nice touch for traveling however i gave this a four star because it is pricey amazon should try and give customers discounts	15
1	this stuff goes on easy stays well \( but will rub off with water wo n't withstand a good cry \) nice not quite as nice as the victoria 's secret liner \( i swear by that stuff discontinued 3 4 years ago \) but way better than anything cheaper i have tried other things plus wo n't irritate my very sensitive eyes	15
1	this eyeliner really matches the description it goes on super smooth and does n't tug or drag i was told at the counter that it was water resistant but it 's really not i used to wear it under my lower eyelashes but by the end of the day it would be totally smudged and gross i would even try to put powder over it but to no avail however in defense of laura i am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes are n't friendly to many pencil eye liners i was just hoping against hope that laura 's would be different ! so now i only use it over the upper lid	15
1	i have used many many products from the cheapest drugstore ones to the high end department store stuff and kinerase cream is truly one of the best for overall skin improvement i am a big fan of minimal redness and irritation and this cream delivers in spades leaves my skin beautifully soft super smooth and all without added perfume \( who 's going to smell your face \? \) and additives i have also used the lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate but i much prefer this cream which adds more moisture and does n't contain any retinoids which can cause irritation is n't that the whole premise and purpose of kinerase anyway \? great stuff	15
1	i have tried so many products b c i have tiny laugh lines and i am so not ready for them yet this product has helped beyond belief ! i love it ! ! ! i wanted to write a review because beauty products are very expensive and i wanted to say save your money and do n't buy anything but kinerase if you want results ! it is awesome ! !	15
1	i bought this 3 in 1 for my fiance' because he loves banana stuff we were both very pleased with it it does smell just like bananas i'm hoping philosophy will come out with a body souflee in the scent soon	15
1	this is the best long wearing lipstick i have ever bought it lasts on me for about 6 7 hours through meals drinks etc the best part is that it is n't flakey it also has little hints of glitter in it that really make your lips shine the icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell	15
1	this is hands down the best all day lipwear i have ever owned i own alot ! ! ! not only does it stay on all day beautifully but it does not dry your lips out with other extended wearlipsticks you are given a seperate hydrating gloss sephora maniac long wearing lipstick does not need it my lips never dried out and looked moist and smooth all day not cakey and cracked as others tend to do purchase this lipstick with cofidence and without hesitation you will not be disappointed	15
1	i like this scent my first thought was pears before reading what the notes were yes apples this is not a hardcore apple scent but enough so very fresh and sweet but not too sweet crisp and spring like a hint a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose just a tiny bit my husband likes this scent on me as well which is saying a lot he hates roses and foody scents but still likes this	15
1	beauty is hard work and savvy and so is this product you 'll find your fresh alluring face that 's been hiding since you were a young child	15
1	i have purchased many different brow pencils over the years and finally found one that is truly wonderful ! the color is perfect and the application is easy and the results are phenomenal the bourjois precision eyebrow pencil is the best i 've ever used i highly recommend it also the brow brush that comes attached to the cover is very nice and leave the brows looking 'finished' and natural i have senitive skin and had absolutely no problems with this product	15
1	i purchased this item for my boyfriend and he loves it it is a great lower end badger hair brush it also conveniently transforms as a metal cylinder for easy travel	15
1	this keychain is very cute and great if your'e friends want to try it becuase it is cheap so they can buy it for themselves i have the pixie flavor and it is great but it fell off my purse once so that 's why i am not giving this item five stars if they made the keychain a little stronger i would definetly give it a five	15
1	i recently bought all 3 of hard candys key to my heart lipgloss there are 2 different shades of lipgloss a sheer shade and a darker thicker shade my favorite one out of the 3 is pop it is a sheer light purple with shimmer and a darker purple gloss they smell and taste like candy it dangles on my keys and it is so cute ! it might be handy to bring a pocket lipbrush with you so it doesnt get on your fingers	15
1	this product actually works as described it helped significantly improve the appearance of a scar created by a chemical burn within 2 weeks the scar is still visible but has lightened a number of shades and feels smoother i highly recommend this produc	15
1	to be totally honest i'm not entirely sure what these ingredients are all about but i do know one thing this stuff really works ! after using this for a couple of weeks i started noticing a visible change in the small dark spots on my face it was n't dramatic but i kept using the repair formula and about a month later i could definitely see a difference ! people have commented on the way i look and i recommend it to all of them it just makes your skin look healthier	15
1	no wonder this is a bestseller ! the results are highly visible and real fast i noticed a change in my skin 's pigmentation just a few days after using it highly effective i recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality product and tired of just fancy labels and marketing	15
1	i 've been using this product for a few years now and it always rescues me when my eczema pops up in the cold weather i once did a comparison between cortisone cream and dream cream and the dream cream won hands down because it kept the scalies away longer than the cortisone did the scent is lavender herbal and very nice	15
1	i have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck that dream cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks i 've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after i get out of the shower on my legs it has completely gotten rid of the red bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter i 've tried dozens of body lotions creams and this is my absolute favorite	15
1	i absolutely love lush products and this is my favorite of them all it smells great \( kind of herbal \) absorbs quickly and is very soothing	15
1	the clean crisp smell of this 3 in 1 product will wake you up in the morning and keep you smelling fresh without overdoing it	15
1	smells great and it is wonderful especially the fact that it is three products in one	15
1	i purched two of the lemon shampoo my wife tried it and i never got it back i was fortunate to have ordered two or i would have gone shampooless \( women ! ! ! \) most excellent product and it smells good also order two or you to will loose yours	15
1	i really like this product i would not however agree with the person who said that it is entirely too strong a scent i would actually like it to be stronger and have less peel and more juice smell but it is a nice scent and cleans very thoroughly not the best i 've used but very nice	15
1	great scent and the body wash and the sparkling lotion alone is well worth the asking price i brought the same item inside of my local mall for twice what i am going to pay here and i never even had to leave the comfort of my own home thanks for the dea	15
1	this soap is unbelievable ! it leaves skin soft and smooth and had no added chemicals	15
1	i always buy this soap when i travel in france when i found it on amazon i was elated ! it is so moisturizing that i never need to use any body creams or lotions with its simple and pure properties of olive oil vegetable oil and mediterranean sea salted water savon de marseille is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin the large 1000gm blocks are a great value and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm bars great for ones' own personal use for gift giving the 300gm bars are perfect ! if you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream use this masterpiece soap	15
1	this soap works well for sensitive skin smells like olive oil but hey that 's why they named it olive oil soap	15
1	this is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from cargo i would very much recommend it the lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin the four stars are because i love smelly things and this one just smells like lipstick it could smell yummier i suppose but so far i love it	15
1	clinique 's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever ! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it i have berrylicious \( sheer grape \) and cherry quartz \( sheer true red does n't look like it does on the color swatch \) and neither overwhelms my pale skin i would n't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse !	15
1	after looking and looking for the perfect brown lipstick that was n't red or too dark i tried this and bought it on the spot this is the best color if you 're looking for a shimmer and just enough color this lipstick is n't sticky dry or cakey	15
1	i 've used a nylon scrubbie for years the salux bath towel is much better ! i received it as a gift from someone who had one and knew how wonderful it was it has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator i use it with a bath gel \( never soap it 's too drying \) and my skin has never been softer it 's extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back it drys very quickly ca n't live without it	15
1	this perfume is my absolute favorite ! ! ! it smells so good i love it ! and this roll on is so easy you can just pack it in your purse and use it whenever its so convenient ! but you wo n't have to really put it on several times day once is enough the scent carries on all day long ! ihighly recommend this fragrance as a gift to anyone	15
1	i just love this product i felt like i was sitting on top of a cloud i definately am going to by this again	15
1	we really like this dish it allows soap and water to drain through you wo n't have the soap scum problem it looks great and has rubber on the bottom and it wo n't slide around on you	15
1	i love the smell of philosophy pure grace the shampoo shower gel smells just as clean and fresh as the perfume it 's not too drying either	15
1	i love the design on the cap but it makes my head look huge ive had it for a year and the elastic is totally stretched out with normal wear beyond that i would buy it just dont expect it to last long	15
1	i used many shower caps but this one is the best i recommend everyone to have it	15
1	this is my absolute favorite product by lush i received a huge box of bath ballistics for my birthday and out of the whole thing this was the best ! it made the water a nice purple color \( without a ring around the tub \) and made my skin smell great even the next day ! i would recommend this one to any first timers so you can see what the buzz around lush is all about ! i am stocking up on this one	15
1	blackberry bath bomb is really relaxing it turns the water a pretty purple color and smells sleepily sweet it 's fairly moisturizing too	15
1	you can feel the huge difference when you put it on it 's really good for normal to oily skin everytime i have a big pimple i put a tiny drop on it before i sleep next day the big pimple almost disappears it 's a magic cosmaetic i will recommand to everyone	15
1	i am no ladies man but the ladies love the givenchy sent it is a young hip classic cologne ala dcg issey miyake etc	15
1	this vitamin e moisture cream has a great soft rosey smell and feels great on my skin i was given a sample which i took home and tried and i was blown away by this product i went back to our local mall a few days later and purchased the product i love it	15
1	i love this soap normally i'm not a bar soap person but this bar really has won me over it smells divine and lasts forever also my skin does n't feel too tight or dry after a bath with this product it is even a pretty color what more could you ask for	15
1	this soap smells great ! smells just like a cherry lollipop ! continues to smell even after the shower throughout the day mix with i love juicy shampoo american cream conditioner and candy dusting powder	15
1	there is actually science to support this serum and per a d magazine article several female dermatologists use it on their own skin you spread a few drops on your face \( and i use it on my neck and back of my hands as well \) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup it does not irritate my sensitive skin \( i have rosacea and seb derm \) or clog my pores a lot of expensive products are just hype but i think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money	15
1	sephora roll up blotting paper is so handy whenever you have to freshen up this is great to use before you powder your face all you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face they feel weightless and matte skin just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff gosh disgusting ! best of all you get so much paper the roll is never ending ! it 's so tiny and compact you would even want to share them with your friends	15
1	this is one of the most perfect concealers i have ever used it goes on nice and creamy \( does not pull on your skin when applying \) and covers those imperfections you also do not need a lot of product to get the job done the colors are very natural and i have found a perfect color in sand for me i will buy this product again	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	i did my christmas shopping in my warm fluffy nightgown the package arrived before christmas i did not pay for gas for shopping i did not fight for a parking space and i did not stand in long lines to pay for my prize my mom 's favorite cologne was also at least 10 20 dollars cheaper then the big stores overhead pricing this is the way to go	15
1	i got this perfume in a set of 4 ohter perfumes from estee lauder this one is really special so good light i loved this perfume more than all the others that i got in the set pleasures was one of them	15
1	an excellent pair of shears sharp and durable i expect them to last a long time	15
1	i bought this along with the some kind of gorgeous foundation faker i do n't have the best skin \( oily \) but like a more natural look these two product together are so great i look natural but healthier and my skin stays less shiny all day i use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it	15
1	beautiful scent not too strong and long lasting i am complimented on it constantly highly recommend	15
1	i have tried ralph lauren 's romance eau de parfum spray and i love its lush floral scent so romantic and sophisticated i use it only on very special occasions and i 've often been asked what perfume are you wearing \? it smells so good i spray it behind my ears and wrists for a long lasting effect so leave a scent of you behind with ralph lauren romance eau de parfum spray a perfume that means always and forever in bloom wholeheartedly recommended	15
1	i have tried i think every product on the market nothing was helping my acne it just kept getting worse i still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this i loved it it did dry my skin out a little but whatever works ! my skin is clearer and smoother it just is n't perfect but who is	15
1	i love this kit my skin feels like velvet new blemishes clear up in a day or 2 and my makeup goes on easier than ever i love philosophy and i 've just bought the booster shots kit to increas ethe effectivness philosophy has gotten me addicted to skincar	15
1	this product is true to its title it is a silk infustion ! ! it made my hair turn from dry and frizzy to silky and soft i hope they do not stop making this product !	15
1	the shade i use is subtle lips i love it ! it gives some color but not so much that i feel done up i could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great and yet it looks great on sundays too because of the mild color it matches everthing and unlike lip gloss it 's not sticky at all \( i ca n't tolerate any stickiness ! \) i am only somewhat picky about scent and taste and to me this one has neither i think it is by far worth the 20 ! !	15
1	the bottle is a good amount for the money and the scent is great last all day	15
1	this one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences it 's not too spicy not sickeningly sweet it 's not trying to do too much just effortless one thing i like about this you 're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses i hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air this one has restraint staying power is debatable but it 's such a wonderful confident woman scent i gave it 5 stars	15
1	this is really a nice product for staying fresh and clean feeling during long flights	15
1	personally i love it i use the lipblush as liner and lipstick for daytime ca n't live without it	15
1	this is absolutely the best concealer ever i have skin that is very sensitive and prone to breakouts with face makeup this stuff has n't been a problem ! it stays put all day long and does not shine	15
1	almost immediately after using this face mask the redness in my face was gone it helps with a number or skin problems and i have sensitive skin so it 's hard to find a product that wo n't hurt me most facial masks cause a minor chemical burn this left my face beautifully soft if you 're unsure of this product or wavering at all let me tell you that you should buy it it 's amazing	15
1	this is a life changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing you just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow and it provides a perfect base twelve hours later the shadow is still perfectly in place i bought this at a neiman marcus store but the product is so good i wanted to make sure i rated it online so others would know how great it is !	15
1	i am very impressed with the whole bobbi brown line this lip gloss is no exception these lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end the colors are fantastic these glosses are all very neutral and natural looking colors none of these glosses are going to make you look too made up just make you look finished the texture is not too tacky or sticky and it has a light scent not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss i highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them	15
1	anyone who gave this lotion a low rating simply did so because they do n't realize achieving great curly hair is a process there is no one product that can do all the work i have thick frizzy damaged curly hair i use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum then after letting air dry for a few minutes finish with gel or mousse for hold the curl enhancing lotion really really improves the look of my curls from uneven ringlets and loose waves to an almost universal loose big curl it 's beautiful ! the only downside is the tiny bottle for such a high price it should be at least 8oz	15
1	i love this light curing lotion ! it smells like orange vanilla creamsicle it enhances the curls in my naturally curly hair makes it more moisturized and smells great ! it has no hold so if you need hold you 'll need to use a gel over it love it and worth the s	15
1	wow ! shesheido has done it again ! i love thier products ! i have oily skin so i like to blot my face once a day the papers are awesome very soft they soak up the oil and i can tell after i throw the paper away usually 1 sheet a day is all i need and my face is shine free ! i love them ! i also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most i have seen so far i love this product and will buy again	15
1	it 's interesting to see all of the oil that this takes from your face it really shows on the paper and it does it 's job not as cheap as washing your face but more fun	15
1	i really enjoyed that this powder let your face looking clean and matte finished instead for shine with glitter like some other bronzers do	15
1	i love this smell its sweet yet warm not too sweet though just right very inviting and you can wear with anything anywhere alot of compliments ! with this one will buy again ! and again	15
1	i first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure it got me curious as they rarely do passing sephora i went in for a test and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent it seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo after a few days i still could n't get the scent out of my head so i went back to grab it up i 've only had this experience with a few other fragrences but they were of a totally different style angel by thierry mugler and flower by kenzo	15
1	the perfume is very subtle with a little hint of sweetness it 's not overpowering or musky do n't try to sniff the bottle or a sample it wo n't do it justice you have to try it on your skin to know how great it smells i 've had other designer frangrances but this is by far my favorite and i 've received a lot of compliments	15
1	all of the bbare escentuals are great ! they make you look so young and fresh i am 61 and people say i look 40 ! even my daugther like it ! she is very hard to please great buy and last a long long time thanks ! ! ! !	15
1	i order the ash color for blondes and found that it is just the right color i also purchased the anastasia brow stensils with this item and finally seem to have found a solution for my thin mismatched brow problem i have ordered many bare escentuals products and love all of them	15
1	i was pleasantly suprised when i received this gift set the bottles are much larger than i had anticipated also the bag is super cute	15
1	feel sexy and tingly without the burn of most lip plumping products your lips will be glossy shiny and soft when you use this product	15
1	i have tried every lip plumper on the market \( no joke \) and this is the best \( besides pure cinnamon leaf oil which burns like hell \) i use b e products and i bought a couple of these bc i liked the colors i was not expecting it to work as well as it did now it is all i use on my lips ! it makes your lips feel cool not burning	15
1	i am new to the world of gloss and have n't tried that many brands but this is definitely on my keeper list if you want something that plumps i would look elsewhere but if your looking for a subtle gloss that smells great and gives your lips a nice chilled feeling this is the gloss for you	15
1	i am so happy they are selling this now outside the gift set i have never had a lip gloss that tastes and looks and feels as great as this does ! i have amber and dolly and plan to try a few other of the colors as its the best i have ever tried !	15
1	i love this stuff i ordered it at a friends body shop party a while back i use it each moring after i shower and it keeps my lips soft all day ! i tried to find something like this in the stores but nothing even came close to being as good as this ! ! ! i highly reccomend it	15
1	very good product and great kind of fruity smell leave hair soft and full of bounce easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long the price here is still more expensive than in europe around 22 euros	15
1	these pencils are the best ! they are the perfect texture and they last a long time	15
1	i love this product it 's a lot more natural looking than foundation and saves a step in the morning it does a good job evening out skin tone and it feels good on my dry skin as someone who does n't wear a lot of makeup it adds that extra bit of polish that makes for a more professional appearance without looking too made up	15
1	i try a lot of products and this is simply my favorite not only do they feel luxurious they look amazing in my bathroom i sent my mom a set and she loves it too	15
1	hey i have been using min shampoo on off for about six months and can no longer go off the stuff because when i do there is dramtic difference as far as the smell goes i do n't need to smell like a coconut or a bloomingsdale just make it pleasant or oderless and give texture and fullness to my hair i do n't think it smells medicated \( unlike reviogen \) but just does n't have too strong of an oder if more people knew of this product more people would be happier with their hair	15
1	it smells as pretty and pink as it looks it 's not to gooey like other shower gels and i will definately repurchase it when i run out	15
1	this liner is thin as advertised goes on easy stays and is really nice stuff be warned though the lightest shade is really light and only good if you 're really pale it barely shows on me i'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even i should 've gone darker on the color recommended	15
1	i found it to have a little too much 'yellow' for my brows \( i have blonde grey hair but it performs well and i like the slim point i just mix in a little of my charcoal to soften the yellow	15
1	i'm nearly forty and i'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight i got this cream and have been using it along with mbt trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer after one month i'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously lumpy legs i ca n't say that it would work wonders alone but as an add on to an exercise program it seems to be helping quite a lot i 've done weight loss programs before and they 've never addressed the cellulite issue this is the first thing that has seemed to work and it 's great moisturizer too	15
1	my husband wears this everyday and i just love it ! ! ! i like to spray my pillow with it when he 's out of town ! ! great smell !	15
1	this is a very rich creme i find it works best for me if i use it all over my face once or twice a week my face breaks out if i use it more often i am 63 years old so blemishes are not a common occurrence for me another alternative would be to use it only on the brow and under the eyes but in that case i would recommend the strivectin sd eye creme which does not have the mint fragrance	15
1	i bought some less than a week ago i 've been using it over my brows between my eyes and under my eyes \( although the directions say not to \) already the fine lines under my eyes have decreased dramatically i love the tingly feel of it as well it 's super expensive here in canada \( 200 a tube \) but so far it 's worth the price i 'd definately buy it again	15
1	unbelievable results was considering botax when i heard about this product thought to try i have used several other products never saw results like strivectin sd used it as directed mainly between brows on top of the lips and the neck within two weeks noticeable results especially around the lip area and the neck have been using it for over 30 days family and friends are noticing it thank you for a great product got all my friends start using ca n't wait to try the eye cream just heard about it	15
1	brush applicator puts it exactly where i want gives my lips a great wet look without being messy never bleeds lasts for hours without touch ups this is the only gloss i 'll use	15
1	i have been using this product for about a year i love it it is a rich non greasy formula that gives my skin a healthy glow i use it alone and under daily makeup great for mature skin	15
1	these are great if you have oily or combination skin just press onto your face and it instantly takes away the oil and the shine it wo n't ruin your makeup and you can use them discreetly almost anywhere anytime these are very similar to the blotting sheets sold by mac cosmetics except these are cheaper and work just as great i 've even caught my boyfriend using it on his face so i guess it would be great for a metrosexual lol ! ! ! you 'll love these as much as i do	15
1	i have loved this product for so many years but have n't found it for more than ten i flew to spain and the evian was an absolute necessity ! it 's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet it is very refreshing and also brightens fading makeup	15
1	love this for hot summer days dry winter days and hot flashes \) a must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun	15
1	great for flying keeps your skin nose from drying out	15
1	great for after the gym great for winter dry skin love it ! ! !	15
1	well i gotta say this one feels goodrefreshing cool calming gives the same feeling you get after you 've just washed your face	15
1	i absolutely love clinique for eye shadow all of their eye shadows go on so smooth never crease and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone the almost peach color is great because i can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base either way i use it just about every day !	15
1	this scent has sweet floral undertones but with a light clean effect many perfumes make me sneeze but not this line i get many compliments while wearing this i sometimes layer it with amazing grace another scent in the philosophy line you wo n't be disappointed	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin bringing newer skin to the surface and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier i was a little wary a first but it works my skin feels softer and looks more even all around	15
1	i am seeing results after three weeks i love this stuff	15
1	i am a hair fanatic test and try everything this comb is the best comb i 've come across for my hair i have a lot of thick hair so this comb really does the job i have been using avon combs for over 5 years now and love them very strong and do n't break easily because my hair is thick i still need to use conditioner to help detangle it other wise my hair would be ruined worth every penny and for 4 99 you ca n't lose	15
1	i use the whole vitament e series \( cleanser toner spf 15 day cream lip balm and the nourishing night cream \) after a year in the desert my skin still looks great i just turned 40 and was carded for buying alcohol last month ! these are gentle products and work extremely well	15
1	this is a perfect winter cream for me and would probably work for anyone else who has very dry skin \( e g you rub eucerin on at night \) it is very similar to the regular cream in appearance \( pink \) and smell \( not offensive \) but it is much heavier i started using this during the winter when i discovered the regular cream was n't heavy enough and it works just as well it spreads on pretty easily for such a thick cream and when i wake up my skin is dewy and moisturized	15
1	i wear stay neutral and have been using this product for years does n't clog pors and it looks flawless this is a really great product and work the 18 00	15
1	okay so i love love love this kit it includes everything you need to have awesome brows except the aestician lol i look forward to see what else this young lady presents us with	15
1	this product works great for bodywash but is much too thick to be a shampoo	15
1	i absolutely love the smell of philosophy 's cinnamon buns like the other reviewers have said it does n't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented i only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense i like the other cinnamon buns products also i use the cream and the lip gloss	15
1	this is a sweet treat ! it smells good enough to eat it also leaves my skin smooth and soft it works good as a shampoo on my thick wavy hair too cinnamon buns 3 in 1 is a wonderful product and everyone should buy it totally worth the dough ha ha	15
1	i have very sensitive skin a thick beard and must shave daily what a hellacious combination ! the art of shaving for sensitive skin is the best shaving cream i have found and i have been searching far and wide as for the rest of their products eh i could take them or leave them i e there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper this shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non comudegenic \( sp \? \) oils that really protect your skin	15
1	i had tried all kinds of skin care systems with different levels of success but in the end the derma step system works the best with long lasting results you can get a free trial and see for yourself here http things4free biz dermaste	15
1	this products delivers what it promises i bought it as part of the makeup optional kit and now i am ordering 2 so that i do n't run out my skin is missing it so badly i discovered good skin i never knew i could have so i must have this product the antioxidants really deliver and roll back the years to reveal younger skin this is my favourite then secondly the purity made simple third the hope is not enough spf cream	15
1	i have been on the search for a new makeup and have been disappointed in so many so i have been pleasantly surprised with how much i like the pur minerals i sets nicely and i do n't feel made up i like that there are no chemicals in it as i have pretty sensitive skin this is not a heavy makeup so if you 're looking for max coverage this is not for you i love the mineral glow too it gives me the perfect glow without looking fake i will be buying this again	15
1	i recently converted to using powder makeup i am hooked i did n't tell anyone i was using it my son was the first person to tell me how nice i looked ! that truly made my day and was all the convincing i needed i absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel goopy like liquid foundation	15
1	this pur minerals starter kit is a great introduction to this brand i am absolutely in love with the 4 in 1 pressed mineral makeup \( included in the kit \) it 's so much better than the bare escentuals makeup which i had been using for years the 4 in 1 provides great coverage as it is a foundation concealer and spf 15 pressed powder all in one with bare escentuals i was having to buy the mineral veil foundation and concealer all separately and i still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well pur minerals is a wonderful makeup very lightweight and even the brush is soft on my skin ! i highly recommend it	15
1	having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks i was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores they seem to enlarge as i age came across this product somewhat by accident i was really amazed at how well it works just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth it mattifies the skin all day \( and i have extra oily skin \) other clinique products have made my skin break out but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks highly recommended	15
1	this is the best shaving product in the whole wide world if you exfoliate first and then use it nothing gets smoother legs for me my sensitive skin yes it seems kind of expensive but you just need a tiny bit at a time in a thin layer so it actually lasts longer for me than several bottles of regular shave gel it also takes up less space	15
1	i bought this as a gift for my head shaving husband he is very happy with his close shave and i have used it as well for my legs a tiny bit goes a long way and it provides a very close smooth shave the downside is the cost it 's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel	15
1	even swimming for two hours in the pool i still have mascara when i emerge from the water would not be without this !	15
1	this product works very well on my fair nordic and sensitive skin it covers well but with a light non oily feeling and combined with a fluff og powder it leaves my skin looking flawless i highly recommend this product	15
1	this is not a strong floral fragrance and not sweet but it smells wonderful it just gets better and better on your skin very complex very different	15
1	my husband and i sat next to a woman on our flight to prague who smelled absolutely delicious a asked her what fragrance she was wearing and she replied marc jacobs i remember it was fresh and clean and subtly floral without being overly sweet now 6 months later i came across it in lord taylor sprayed a tester on my wrist and instantly remembered why the fragrance was so captivating without more than 30 seconds of contemplation i purchased the gift set ca n't wait to experience this fresh winning scent over and over again	15
1	for a long time i avoided anything with gardenia like a plague it always smelled too sickly sweet to me this perfume changed my mind completely yes there is gsrdenia but its very light and fresh and unlike any gardenia you 've ever smelled try it for yourself	15
1	i love this it smells so good diddy struck gold with this one as he always says preserve the sexy this is sex	15
1	lush makes a few products with lemon but i think this is one of the best because it has coconut oil for deep conditioning and it is a little intoxicating with the scent of vetivert the earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the jungle conditioner which also contains vetivert oil use this conditioner after the daddy o shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake i can also recommend the honey trap lip balm and the smitten hand cream all that jas is also a wonderful product for the bath the rebecca review	15
1	moisturize and refresh yourself as you relax in this foamy bath your stress will soak away and you 'll feel truly happy	15
1	i really enjoyed this bomb it was very refreshing and relaxing it is a big bomb and i could have broken it in half but i did n't want to risk missing a thing ! so far i have been happy with my lush purchases and my favorite bomb is sex bomb but i would buy this one again or give it as a gift	15
1	i love zoya polish it is pure and the colors are fabulous they stay and stay and stay i'm ready to order again	15
1	i love zoya nail polish and this is the best summer color ever	15
1	the best i have smelled put this on your babies momma and you'l be smooching all night long you just wont wanna let your woman go if you r a woman buying this your man will go crazy for you and if he doesnt i will lol	15
1	this is not my first purchase from iman cosmetics i love the coverage the powder gives and the color compliments me very well i would definitely purchase this powder again	15
1	this is new for me i have been trying to switch all products to zoya due to the formadahyde free formulas so far so good	15
1	much better in terms of coverage than the new loreal makeup that diane keaton touts which is more creamy but just does n't cover as well avon 's mousse foundation goes on almost like a powder but does n't block my pores i highly recommend it	15
1	this product blended well into my skin and i forget that i was wearing makeup what is amazing about avon is that their products are very economical and yet is of very high quality i am usually acne prone so i am careful about what i use on my face it is not oily and yet even dry skins can use it it is very matte and can be worn alone	15
1	this stuff smells awesome i have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy i have n't used it yet because i love the smell so much and i do n't want it to go away i just ordered a bunch though so i will try it out they are really pretty too if i was a kid and did n't know any better i would probably try to eat it	15
1	covers great \( i have read splotches \) and is good for my skin cannot recommend it highly enough	15
1	this powder provides excellent coverage without being thick \( thick powder base is horrible it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour \) my freckles are still there but my skintone is more even it did its job of concealer very well no red spots no dark circles and it works very well as a foundation powder much better than any other powder foundation i 've ever used come to think of it much better than any liquid foundation i 've ever used	15
1	china glaze is my favorite polish but perhaps it 's because they are the only ones i 've ever seen with this color 86 your touch it 's so gorgeous i 've had compliments on it nearly every place i go china glaze seems to have limited retail distribution so i 've had to order it online for years and this vendor was perhaps the best ever in sending it out so quickly ! great job	15
1	i bought this because i wanted a primer for make up but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out as some reviews have stated initially i did break out a little but i kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth after a week the breakouts went away \( they were minor \) and all i can say is wow my skin looks so much better my make up looks better i look better without make up etc etc i use it with complete me powder foundation and i have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products	15
1	i love this stuff ! i have my mother 's hands as my sister calls them as the years go by they 're getting more and more wrinkly and i also have age spots i gave some to my sister last year and now she 's got me buying it too ! this hand cream makes my hands smooth and silky feeling without being greasy it 's also improved the condition of my cuticles in only a few applications i 'd highly recommend it to anyone who has dry hands and cuticles you 'll love it too	15
1	seriously at first i thought it may be too harsh \( this from someone who has skin that can take a beating ! \) but after awhile i found it not harsh enough ! what i do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub trust me this stuff truly is wonderful	15
1	i am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products i received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty \( also good \) i was blown away by how this product made my skin feel i have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer this scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft i am totally hooked ! you will love it too totally worth the money	15
1	the best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent apply and leave on the skin for about 20 30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly then you start shaving it 's great because you do n't feel the razor on the skin as much which makes shaving quite pleasant i 've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is anthony logistics which i do n't think as nice as philosophy common man a little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long i would buy this again	15
1	i received this product as a x mas gift this year i really do like it considering the last two philosophy products i did not care for \( the gingerbread man bodywash and amen cologne \) out of the tube it 's a little thick but you only need a thin layer to do the trick it offers up a nice smooth shave and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward definitely a keeper	15
1	this is my favorite mascara in the world i 've tried many brands and nothing compares ! i'm sold	15
1	i 've never liked my lashes until i put this on what a difference	15
1	this stuff is fantastic1 it smells and looks like mint chocolate chip icecream \( too bad it does n't taste like it \) it cools and sooths the skin while exfoliateing away the dead skin i keep mine in the fridge as an extra cool treat	15
1	made my skin smooth and very clean i loved the minty smell will definitely buy it agai	15
1	when you buy this perfume for your girlfriend do n't tell her it was under 40 dollars ! i do n't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume yeah like it really smells better just because it 's more expensive anyway sarah jessica parker perfume has a really nice scent that you 'll want to smell over and over it 's nice that you do n't have to spend a lot of money on it either add just a touch for proper use	15
1	i love this scent it makes me feel good ! it is light but sexy it is not overpowering in any way so i even wear it to work i spray it on every morning to start the day off feeling good they say that scents can affect your mood well this one in particular really makes me feel great	15
1	i love this perfume it 's subtle and elegant and just beautiful	15
1	is there anyone that does n't know sarah jessica parker \? great perfume very nice smell	15
1	this fragrance starts off fine but the longer you wear the better it gets and that very nice smell lasts a wonderfully long time ! !	15
1	i got the gift box i love it it smells very modern and you can layer it with a sugar or a vanilla to make your own blend it smells money because it is so sophisticated i love how it wears it gets nicer as the evening goes on i like that in a scent	15
1	once again spending a little more money for a product that does what it advertises is worth it this is the only toner i have ever used that completely diminishes oil and shininess without over drying my skin i alternate with 3 depending on the weather	15
1	if you 're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done nioxin system scalp therapy is the answer \( the numbers only represent the type of hair you have use a lower number if your hair is more fine \) use this once or two times after color and the scalp itch goes away the product claims to help thinning hair i have no issue with that and i think i found an off market use for the product but it works for me so i 'll take it	15
1	this is a really fun gift for children \( although you might have guessed that i like them too \) it has a sweet fruity scent without being a sugar buzz and the colors are very bright and cheerful i would suggest one of those wire or slotted soap dishes to help these dry easier and faster though a regular soap dish without any type of draining makes it melt faster	15
1	whenever i saw glass or porcelain nail files in stores i always thought they were overpriced you can get all kinds of nail files for a couple of bucks and i did n't see a reason to pay more but i was given one of these and now i think it 's worth it it is a really strong file so strong that my mother was startled by how much it took off the first time she used it you really only need very gentle pressure and speed with this type of file it is very easy too clean and shows no signs of wear by this time i usually would have killed a normal file	15
1	these are good and do the trick but it 's hard to get my fingers in the holes	15
1	this mascara goes on like a dream and stays put throughout the day without tearing or irritation your lashes will look like they belong in an advertisement	15
1	i was n't crazy about this mascara when i first put it on but it grew on me the brush is not a regular mascara brush and it took a little getting used to however i love it now it brushes the clumps right off your lashes as you apply they 'll be long and nicely separated and the stuff stays on your lashes like glue all day no smearing and it still looks perfect at the end of the day to the point where i feel like it 's a shame to wash my eye makeup off i'm really pleased with it i want to try lancome 's new mascara too but this one is definitely a keeper	15
1	the pores of the face become clogged with makeup cremes sunscreens bronzing gels powders etc exfoliation washing facials steaming do not remove blackheads whiteheads and clogged pores this simple product gets them out ! buying one will last a life time no need to buy another ever the ultimate cleaning device	15
1	bobbi brown makes excellent lip colors they are very smooth and have some staying power	15
1	this smells so wonderful ! wear it and you will get compliments it seems like it might be a summertime only scent \( i e very tropical \) but i 'd wear it year round i only wish they made a larger size in the oil	15
1	what i like most about these vitamins is that they are very small and easy to swallow unlike a lot of other hair and nail vitamins which are huge i am not sure if i notice a difference in the condition of my hair but i will continue to purchase and use the vitamins nevertheless	15
1	i took this supplement for 6 months and i noticed a dramatic change in hair appearance length and my nails ! ! i would like to keep taking it but i ca n't afford it for a while which i am really bummed out about it i definitely recommend this product it also has a huge celebrity following and now i know why	15
1	i have started taking this supplement a month ago and i feel my hair is stronger than ever also my hair loss has became minimal ! besides that my nails are harder i love it	15
1	i have the beginnings of crow 's feet the essential c eye cream has helped to decrease the lines and restored the elasticity and suppleness of the delicate skin around my eyes	15
1	i was given this product as a gift and i just love it i 'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup it smoothes this skin surface true the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone also i was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin it would create lines etc so i started combining the two things the tinted cream base and the philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and bingo this solved the problem so if you want a tint plus the smoothness you might want to give this a try	15
1	i have been using this powder for about 5 years it is amazing i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear it even comes with the perfect application brush this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	15
1	great towel for the gym or after swimming very absorbant and i also use one to cover the circuit machines when i use them	15
1	i first tried amazing grace a couple of years ago at that time i had a dresser full of department store colognes the scent of amazing grace is somehow undescribable suffice it to say it is the perfect fragrance and those other scents are history it is pleasing to the person who wears it and is pleasing to someone just walking by you some perfumes walk into a room before the person does or is so strong it makes other people 's eyes water we 've all been around someone like that not so with amazing grace it is just in harmony with you and those around you	15
1	i hardly ever wore a fragrance until i received amazing grace as a christmas present i love it it is clean and sensual whoever says this smells like a granny must have a strange sense of smell there 's nothing granny about it it is never overpowering	15
1	i totally disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny ! i do n't know what they 're smelling but obviously it 's not this it does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in but it certainly does n't smell like any granny i 've ever smelled i always get compliments when i wear this fragrance \( which is every day \) complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good i smell i recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance \( 1 spray should do the trick \)	15
1	i am a bonafide lush junkie and this stuff is what makes me so smells great works wonders and for 22 dollars of high end shampoo you could n't get a better deal this stuff will last me 4 months at least	15
1	smells great ! not too harsh on my thin but long hair	15
1	even better than i expected ! light fresh scent that is not overly sweet	15
1	i have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side the problem with most conditioners i 've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it they are very heavy and weigh my hair down i found out about kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at amazon it 's wonderful doing everything i need including making my hair nice and shiny without the heaviness i recommend it highly	15
1	expensive but a small amount makes a big difference excellent conditioner for dry thick hair also very pleasing fragrance the best hair treatment i 've found for my straight coarse dry hair highly recommended	15
1	this stuff is amazing i use candle light underneath my eyes and around my brows it makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long it 's especially beautiful in sunlight really makes my blue eyes pop !	15
1	i am very glad with my purchase it gives a subtle natural glow to skin not a tacky shiny one i am usually not very comfortable with wearing foundation and i prefer tinted moisturizers happy light gives even complexion without being heavy it also offers sun protection spf 15 if you do n't need more than medium coverage it is worth considering this brand	15
1	the charcoal in this soap acts as a sort of rasp for exfoliating dead skin cells the licorice extract soothes and rehydrates this is a very good soap if you have minor break outs or oily skin if you are very sensitive you might want to try fresh farmacy instead \( it has calamine lotion \)	15
1	i love auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume pink sugar to death but it is such an overpowering scent that i am often smelled before i am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate aquolinas new perfume chocolovers is similarly sweet but much subtler if you love the sweet scent of pink sugar but do n't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away try chocolovers	15
1	i bought this mostly because of how obsessed i am with pink sugar this product smells sweet it smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house i personally think of this as a good thing i love candy food scents my perfume collection is such that i am suprised i'm not followed everywhere i go by a swarm of bees if you 're looking for a sophisticated scent please do n't buy this or pink sugar if you are looking to have people ask hey do you smell a delicious cake \? everytime you walk past buy away and who does n't want to smell like a delicious cake \?	15
1	'do n't know what these others are talking about chocolovers smells yummy ! what 's great about this fragrance is that it 's not overwhelming and it 's not going to make you smell like dessert it 's got chocolatey tones but it 's not just about chocolate it 's warm and musky with orange oil hazlenut vanilla if in doubt you can always go to sephora and try a sample first \( see sephora com for store locations \)	15
1	neostrata is simply the best line of products i was introduced by my dermatologist 10 years ago they keep getting better i am 48 and most think i am 36 ! ! ! use all the products ! great	15
1	this is the very best hairstyler and hair dryer in one ! i have very fine thick shoulder lenght hair and was a little skeptical that this product would be usefull for me it is ! actually it is the best hair styling product i have ever purchased it dries and sets my hair very quickly usually in five minutes or less what a timesaver i am so delighted with this product that i purchased eight \( 8 \) to keep in my closet so i do n't have to hunt for the best product ever ! ! !	15
1	this light refreshing fragrance is a classic and you 'll use it every day the simplicity of this cologne gives it a style all its own	15
1	this is really good smelling cologne i hardly use it anymore though because of its current popularity gio may be the most popular cologne out there i would much rather be original than one of the herd you 'll have to make the decision yourself be original or smell like everyone else	15
1	i use to be a huge calvin klien fan until i came across this product i 've been wearing it since 2000 and have not been without it since the ladies love the scent which is obvious as i 've had women come up and sniff me in public \( yes public and then be excused when asking me what brand of cologone i have on \) forget bout those axe and tag promo 's in the real world this is the stuff that get you remembered not just noticed	15
1	every home should have some ! there is no greater soap for beautiful scent gentle cleansing and a unique ability to comfort and pamper a perfect gift and a must in posh top notch hotels etc some scents are universal while others distinctly feminine either way they are worth a try and well worth the buy	15
1	i love lola lip gloss it is n't too tacky lasts a long time and the colors are gorgeous i bought the fantastica color as a key chain lip gloss several years ago and was so impressed with it that i bought la petite menagerie as a replacement i love the idea of having it on a key chain so your never without lip gloss ! all the colors in this kit are great	15
1	this mascara goes on beautifully and looks great but it 's messy it 's more liquid than most mascaras and when i travel with it the tube leaks ! it also tends to smear when i first put it on but after it dries it 's good for the day if you carry mascara with you or travel often look for another brand	15
1	i 've used this cream for years i like the way it feels and makes my skin look i 'd recommend it to anyone	15
1	i'm always skeptical of age defying products but this one really works i 've been using it since it first came out \( maybe 10 years \? \) and people often think i'm younger than i am \( 27 \) i'm not really using it for that though i use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne it prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples so fast when i run out the breakouts are back	15
1	it is a little pricey but so worth it to me ! i had a ruddy and uneven skin tone on my face and this has worked wonders for me i love this product ! it really does what it says !	15
1	wow ! my husband and i both use this scrub it is very refreshing the salt scrub is easy to apply and leaves a nice minty smell in the shower and on the skin for at least an hour ! like the previous review i feel the chill after getting out of the shower then i was full of energy ! i look forward to trying this one after a hot work out or yard work ! this will be a staple in our household !	15
1	i recieved this as a gift and have always loved other products by philosophy this is great for a hot sticky day and you want to jump in the shower exfoliate and cool off the first time i used it i have to admit i was freezing after my shower ! it has a very strong cooling effect that lasts on the skin for at least an hour the smell is very natural not artificial like a few other of philosophy 's 3in1 it 's a combo of mint and wintergreen i would compare it to their candy cane scent i 've been using it reguarly after workouts it 's great ! ! a nice cool down	15
1	murad 's skin perfecting lotion is the best product on the market i have oily skin and this is a light moisturizer it did n't clog my pores or cause any breakouts its great to use in the morning and evening	15
1	not as much coverage as i would like for my mildly ruddy complexion but it definitely smoothes out skin texture and moisturizes very well	15
1	the strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like bonomo turkish candy i bought when i was a kid i like it but i think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on qvc other shower gels are creamier than this i 'll enjoy using this and the eggnog then go back to making my own	15
1	this is one of my favorites i love the scent it does n't smell like fresh strawberries because it 's not supposed to it 's supposed to smell like a strawberry milkshake \( and i think they did a good job of it so this is what i expected \) philosophy does a good job of matching the scent to the name the only thing i did n't expect was that i still need to condition with another conditioner i 'd say it 's a shampoo and shower gel a 2 in 1 not a 3 in 1	15
1	like i stated in the title this is n't my favorite three in one product from philosophy i have several of their scents and i really love cinnamon buns and some of the chocolatey ones strawberry milkshake smells nice but it is very sweet i would n't say it smells artifical but it does n't smell like fresh strawberries either i have used it as a shampoo conditioner quite often and i have no issues with it i have fine hair and it did n't leave me with tangles like some of the other reviewers have complained about	15
1	works exceptionally well dont use water just place 10 15 drops into bowl and like a tea candle creates warm and relaxing aromas	15
1	when i tried this on it washed make up and pores nicely but after i washed my face my skin felt so rubbery and a little too dry maybe because i didn`t get the right skin soap for it but when i tried other ones it still had the same effect	15
1	i find these soaps to be very good there are actually 4 different kinds i believe one also for sensitive skin if someone felt a none clean feeling afterwards perhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type this soap is similiar to dhc soaps from japan if they are to drying try using the correct soap for help i would suggest going to the clinque counter or ask me	15
1	everything is fine except i was a bit irritated by shedding it leaves bristles on my face and they get into the razor i hope it will pass with time as other reviewers reported foaming action is very good and badger bristle is much more pleasent to the touch than boar i 'll report again on this item in few months	15
1	i too am very pleased with this brush my previous brush had a ceramic handle that cracked this wood handle seems built to last the badger bristles are excellent i paid 10 unusually low price for a quality shave brush	15
1	this shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure badger bristle shaving brush i 've now been using it for a year and a half and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market the brush head remains densely packed and quite soft hopefully it will remain that way for some time to come in the meantime i do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush because of it i have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel they just ca n't compare to your average 1 50 cake of shaving soap and this brush this was a very worthwhile purchase for me	15
1	after buying some lush products from here i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful after explaining my horrendous hair issues they gave me some samples of rehab retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream they all work wonderfully rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft my hair has literally never felt better i highly recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter	15
1	i have dry unmanagable curly hair and rehab has done wonders for it ! because all the lush shampoos do n't contain any silicones it takes about one or two weeks for your hair to get used to it the squeeky feeling described in the other review is because of the lack of silicones this feeling disappears however when your hair dries up since i use rehab my hair is bouncy soft and shiny especially great in combination with american cream conditoner \( just love that scent !	15
1	this is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids actually i liked everything about this product certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance no more mini bottles of shampoo for me	15
1	for some reason chicks dig this aroma i 've tried many clognes over many years but this gets the best reaction i'm getting more now at the request of several ladies so i decided to write this review with my luck they 'll stop making the stuff now so i'm buying 5 bottles just in case	15
1	this is a really great smelling colonge really fragrent but not in your face strong i love to where this cologne before i go and do something really fun like going on a date or hanging with the guys cause i really think that this colonge is lucky there are plenty of times i was doing something mischevious and i swear i did n't get caught cause i was lucky \) get it \? i smells good and it is just like a rabbit foot with luck pick some up ! ! ! !	15
1	this is a great mascara it does n't get clumpy but it leaves your lashes fuller longer and it lasts without flaking or smudging well worth the price which is surprisingly lower than most other department store brands	15
1	i received a sample of this mascara \( in black \) and just love it it 's perfect for everyday wear as it 's not too dramatic and is very long lasting in fact it 's so long lasting that i even took a nap while wearing it and it did n't smudge at all i was pleased to find however that it came off very easily with my clinque rinse off foaming cleanser so there was no need for a separate eye make up remover i have more expensive mascaras than this and they are not as good definitely a great product	15
1	i really like using this product the color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle i like using this after i have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older the shimmer powder does n't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	awesome product best concealer i 've ever used it is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye creases that my almost 50 year old eyes have the pink undertone brightens and lightens	15
1	this lip gloss is great not only does it taste great the initial stickiness goes away after a few moments and stays on longer than most other glosses definitely a must have for anyone 's make up bag	15
1	i love lemon curd so i was quite happy to discover philosophy 's frozen lemon custard lip shine the consistency is quite thick and coats the lips well this is by far my favorite lip shine scent	15
1	yum ! fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever i use this it smells wonderful deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge this shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin i do n't like it as a shampoo as much when i do use it to wash my hair i'm sure to follow up with a conditioner it 's a delightful product and i'm pleased with my purchase	15
1	this stuff smell delicious who can resist \? i love it ! ! smells like chocolate mint to me love i	15
1	unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions you should n't use this i have oily normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me it is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients but beware this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing it is not in my opinion as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin and does not contain the retinyl palmitate both are good but kinerase cream is better	15
1	mally 's shimmmer shape glow is the best ! ! ! i love the colors and she gives you an instructional guide that aids you on how to apply the shimmer shape and finally the glow this girl knows what it takes to help you look like jlo or beyonce' on the street i cannot count how many times people have stopped and said how much they liked my makeup and i give all credit to mally roncal for her inspiration to help women feel girly try the product you will like it	15
1	i have been using this product for over a year only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes a little goes a long long way one jar lasted me about 4 months using every day this product blends into the skin quickly and i use it under make up it calms my skin i am happy about this product	15
1	save a trip to the dermatologist and buy this whitehead remover you 'll finally be able to remove those blemishes on your own at home	15
1	i finally did what i should have done before all the black marks i bought a blackhead extractor which is face friendly tweezerman makes fine equipment i use a lot of their nail instruments \( i'm a licensed nail technician \)	15
1	i have used hundreds of kinds of smoothers and conditioners on my thick color treated hair \( it is poofy and rough without any help ! \) and this stuff did the trick to make is smooth lay down and be soft in one treatment ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! buy this stuff if your hair is coarse and poofy and spilt damaged ! you need this stuff it smells good is easy to use \( and just use a tiny bit ! \) and works	15
1	it is a very good conditioner it is light and yet conditioning but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish it smells distinctively barnyard but i see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me	15
1	i have sensitive acne prone combination skin \( oily in the t zone \) i 've used various toners for months at a time and this is the first toner that does n't burn when i use it it reminds me of a better smelling witchhazel astringent i used witchhazel as a kid to help prevent my skin from breaking out it has a nice fruity scent which is great since most toners \( especially clinique \) smell like alcohol i just wish it was a little cheaper ! the bottle is pretty big so it will last me for 3 months which makes the price not quite so painful i use it with the clarifiance oil free gel cleanser morning and night	15
1	i normally do not like anything with a sandalwood scent but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull ! they are not lying when they refer to it as an addictive scent in the description i got a small sample bottle and fell in love it is perfect for the winter fall seasons not so much for the summer it 's fun when people ask what i'm wearing and i get to casually say prada considering i live in tennessee most people have no idea what that means but i still feel special	15
1	i have coarse afrcian american hair that is relaxed straight this conditioner is the best i have ever used i wish i could buy it in a larger bottle the only thing however i think it is expensive because of the price i use it only when wanting to deeply condition my hair otherwise i would use it after every shampoo wonderful stuff	15
1	i gave this to my daughter for christmas and i do not think she has used it because i have used it every day and love it ! great for adult acn	15
1	heads up lightening fast very cute purple works great i wonder if they make these smaller as well ill be looking i love this thing	15
1	go read the review i wrote on the shampoo the same goes for this product cheaper at qvc then amazon like all the other 30 or so products i have shopped around for in the last 6 months go back into the stores people you will find prices cheaper than at amazon ! ! !	15
1	i purchased this after reading the reviews i had never heard of it let alone tested it i had some gift certificates thought i 'll be impulsive when i first opened it i thought oh no this is going to be heady \( or strong \) but it seemed to 'change within seconds upon application and got even better as it settled my daughter wears vera wang princess and she too loves lolita it 's my newest fav a possible signature scent for me will def buy again	15
1	i have been looking for this eyeliner for years ! ever since they stopped carrying it at rite aid i have been on a quest to find the perfect waterproof eyeliner to replace the 2 99 lord and berry one i even tried expensive brands like mac and clinique with no such luck this eyeliner is great for women who like to line their inner eye it goes on smooth and dark and stays put until you wash it off	15
1	of all the other caswell massey scents i 've tried some are kind of old fashioned smelling high quality soaps in luxurious packaging not as long lasting as some other triple milled soaps i 've tried	15
1	very paticular about how i smell dont just wear anything on my skin but this fragrance is just what a person like me would wear i so recommend this lovely fragrance to those women who so enjoy having the sweeetest smell flowing from their skin love this fragrance	15
1	the resort we stayed at in fiji \( maravu on the island of taveuni also highly recommended \) used pure fiji products in their bures and i fell in love with this pineapple soap we showered outdoors and the smell and feel will always remind me of our honeymoon i brought some of this soap back in my luggage but it was lost somehow so i just had to buy some ! we did get some of the shampoo and conditioner samples which also smell wonderful ! mmmm	15
1	this is a great cleaner but i 'd suggest getting the anthony algae cleanser first this glycolic facial cleaner does prep your face for a good shave but overdries it is not suggested for those who have dry skin or acne problems	15
1	this is a replacement for one i bought ten years ago ! i cannot put on mascara without my sepralash i give them out as gifts i panicked when the teeth finally fell out of my last one \( i used it to death \) ladies do n't put on lashes without one	15
1	i love this shampoo ! it smells wonderful is rich and thick and always wakes me up in my morning shower i have tried quite a few of the philosophy 3 in one products and this is one of my favorites	15
1	this stuff smells just like philosophy 's handmade hand cream but not as strong that 's why i took one point off it has a light sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background of course it 's is wonderful as a shampoo and body gell just like all the other philosophy 3 1 's if it where stronger scented it would be my favorite	15
1	i use this purely as shower gel cleanser and absolutely love it the smell is great not too overpowering and really perks me up in the morning it reminds me of the lemonade stands i used to have as a kid easily one of my favorite philosophy fragrances i also recommend falling in love and strawberry daquiri in fact i do n't think you could go wrong with any philosophy products !	15
1	i am impressed with this new scent by philosophy it seems just like lemon pudding that my mom likes so well definitely a new fave	15
1	i received a free sample during clinique days at my local department store i wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how clean and light it smelled two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves it is perfect for a light clean scent during the day to wear to work or a day out with friends or that special someone it smells wonderful but not as though you are trying too hard perfect	15
1	the citrus touch in this perfume keeps it from being flowery and potentially old ladyish it is not too strong even at first application but wears quite well you will not feel as though you are wearing perfume it seems far too light for that i would certainly recommend it for its versatility as well	15
1	it 's a lovely light refreshing perfume lovely for daywear loves it guys	15
1	i love this perfume because it really lifts my mood i always thought of it as a little more citrus y but it 's just a very fun perfume it 's also nice because it 's fun and flirty but still mature in a young professional type of way if that makes any sense ultimately it 's a great perfume and i wear it almost daily	15
1	this product is wonderful for individuals with very dry skin i usually apply this cream right before i put my foundation on and it works very well together it leaves my skin feeling very moist without it being sticky in addition to that it 's got a luscious cucumber smell to it i would highly reccomend this product to those who are seeking to get rid their moisture thirsting skin although it may be alittle costly it will last you about 4 months	15
1	i have amazing grace pure grace baby grace and falling in love these are the only scents i use now but falling in love was a bigger bottle than the other three and i'm almost out of it this is the best i 've ever smelled	15
1	i absolutely love this fragrance i like and use a lot of philosophy products the only problem i have is that it does n't last long when i do put it on i get a lot of compliments when it 's fresh	15
1	i really love this gift set you will smell sooo yummy ! ! at first when i put it on it smelled so familiar then my husband and i decided it reminds us of sweet cotton candy we love it ! although now i am getting hooked on amazing grace also a familiar clean fresh scent philosophy is great	15
1	i have used these for years and when i run out my skin knows and shows the difference i have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather cold or hot i carry these in my purse and have them stashed all over the house misting my face many times a day voila clear and moisterized skin ! they really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin and they keep mine from being red and itchy which makes me very happy	15
1	these are just great for cooling of quickly without a sticky feeling unable to find them in the stores	15
1	love this for hot summer days dry winter days and hot flashes \) a must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun	15
1	ever wished you could rub your eyes while you 're wearing your make up \? now you can you ca n't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never ever smudge one might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night but all you need to remove it is water this stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved	15
1	this mascara is great it 's easy to remove with a little warm water but the best thing about it is that it wo n't give you 'racoon eyes' there 's no dis coloration of the skin around the eyes it also keeps looking great all through the day no need to re apply it the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is that even though they come in different colors they all look more black than colored when dry so the color does n't stand out enough still i can highly recommend it	15
1	philosophy products are very eye catching their smart clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each i work with skin care products and do n't always believe what they claim there are usually far too many claims to be made that simply ca n't be done to someones skin this product however is pretty good it 's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product but it does do the job it promises the only problem i have with it is that for someone with sensitive skin there is far too much frangrant extracts in here it cannot be good for sensitive skin i 'd recommend this to dry skin people only	15
1	someone turned me on to this eye cream and it 's been like getting an extra hour of sleep a night ever since the best trick \? keep it in the fridge apply after you shower you can feel it tightening away	15
1	wonderfully light and clean scent ! both men and women have asked me what i was wearing hours after i thought the scent was gone it does not overpower when layering lotion and spray it 's a beautiful fragrance i love it	15
1	this is one of my favorite perfumes i love anything vanilla and this has a great combination of it with violets musk and iris it is a strong smell so go easy on it one spray lasts all day	15
1	i have had this for many years lasts a long time and doesnt seem to get that old smell even after five years it is very unique and the scent has a 'rich quality' to it the scent seems to change as the day goes on i really like it	15
1	this perfume is n't comparible to anything finally a totally unique scent ! it 's sweet and sexy and the scent changes with you i'm addicted to it so are the men !	15
1	i used the same mascara for years i came across bourjois pump up the volume on an internet site so i thought i 'd give it a go it really does pump up those lashes and it stays put for most of the day too i use this mascara all the time now i think its great	15
1	i got this as a gift last christmas and i loved it the scent is very nice and actually lasts i give britney credit for this one i need to replace it already thats how much ive used it its almost gone i recommend this one	15
1	i love love love this product ! this powder foundation has the best coverage out there ! i do n't like to wear liqued foundation because it makes my skin feel real oily this powder foundation is better than any out there	15
1	i love to include one of these with gifts people love them makes a bath really special little rosebuds floating in the water just charming	15
1	this smells good and the heart shape is cute but it lost it 's scent when it dissolved which was dissipointing and the flowers turned the water darkish i liked it but it 's not one of my favorites	15
1	if you love roses this is a romantic bath luxury with seven rose buds for your bathing delight for a candlelit bath with romance let it dissolve unencumbered for scent but no mess put it in a mesh bag first because little flower bits will be all over the tub at least it has no glitter the scent is not particularly strong but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful	15
1	this is the one you give to someone you love the wonderful rose scent is very light not overpowering at all and the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming i love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me it makes me feel like i'm lying in a beautiful garden	15
1	well for startes this is one of the best cologes out there the smell is chrisp and will last a long time it is a great cologne for any acasion i have many colognes and this one is on the top of my list very masculine but girls love it ! ! ! !	15
1	i had read about these new creme eyeshadows in one of the magazines within the last few months i decided to go to the counter at the bloomingdale 's near my house the sa at the counter said she thought based on my coloring and eyes that the rose gold would be a good choice for me i was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime i took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on not only that but it is long lasting and does n't crease i may have to invest in one or more of the other colors available definitely a worthwhile purchase and the tube will last you a long time	15
1	i love this soap ! it smells so fresh and my skin feels great after i wash with it ! i am definetely ordering more of this soap	15
1	this product is great ! i had always been a non believer but in the eight month with my second pregnancy when i could not take the strecth marks the itching the pain the red skin i used it and it was like magic three days of use and i am a new person with soooo much better skin getting better everyday	15
1	i experianced a small problem that was completly resolved to my satisfaction what a great company to do buisness with	15
1	do n't be afraid to smile and do n't cover up those smile lines you can eliminate them with this amazing product from clinique	15
1	i was pretty wary of buying this because of the price but it really is worth it the can has lasted me almost a year and it 's not even empty ! it 's wonderful ! i have very oily acne prone skin with rosacea and this stuff makes me look like i have a flawless beautiful complexion and i'm not exaggerating it feels like i'm not wearing makeup i just ca n't say enough about it this is the one thing that i could n't live without you need to try it ! ! !	15
1	i have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have also my coloring is very fair red hair and blue eyes even with brown black mascara i always looked a little off matched the brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any i have ever used the ease of removal is the icing on the cake	15
1	it is my first time to buy fagarance the smell is so refreshing enhance my feminine and it do cheer me up i like it v much and will use this fagarance in the rest of the life	15
1	i really loved the clean citrus scent of tommy girl it has a grapefruit like scent very clean and pungent unfortunately after i became pregnant and had my son my body chemistry changed now it stinks on me o \( still it smells great as a scent but you may want to try a tester before buying it this is one of those fragrances that i think are a bit risky to buy sight unseen unless you 're sure your gal absolutely loves clean citrusy pungent scents \( but remember that does n't mean it will smell good on her	15
1	this product is the best my youngest daughter used it at my home and said she wanted the margarita then my oldest daughter said the same i like them both equally do follow the directions	15
1	the first thing you notice is the clean burst of citrus it 's yummy and fresh and sexy then the fragrance reveals its deeper layers and you are drawn in this is a wonderful fragrance for men both of vera wang 's fragrances \( for men and women \) are top quality multi layered emminently pleasing and would make fabulous gifts buy this for your man and enjoy	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	this is truly the best in highlighting products and i have tried many high end and cheaper products out there this is so light and just does n't get all cakey and greasy i have tried so many brands that claim to look natural but they just do n't this really does and do n't let the price fool you either it only takes alittle and lasts a long time so well worth the price for the look it gives i love this !	15
1	i 've been using touche eclat ever since it came out i still love it cannot believe how rested i look after i put this on my dark circles are minimized i look radiant till now no other concealer can beat ysl 's touche eclat ca n't live without this product !	15
1	well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	15
1	i'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color i would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil this is a perfect neutral color i subtracted one star because iprefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush i think it looks more natural brenda christian makes a brow powder which i prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powderi can find sometimes i mix the two i start with the pencil and add a bit of powder all all it 's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils	15
1	i like that the gloss is n't goopy or sticky and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while but you do n't get much product i bought flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips i was n't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen but overall i do like it but do n't know if i 'd buy it again	15
1	i bought this item as a gift but i have used philosophy products in the past they are wonderful and have an amazing fragrance ! ! and they produce amazing lather	15
1	i found this sent the most amazing i found it in the december 2006 issue of gq i was determined to find it i found it i was so excited i work at a fast food restraunt and i put prada amber on before my 8 hour shift and tords the end of my shift people could still smell this fragrance i was so excited i would recomind this to anyone who wants to feel safistacated	15
1	bought this for my boyfriend and i ca n't stop smelling him because it 's unlike any other cologne i 've ever come upon it 's so intriguing that i find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it i can best describe it as a soft suede with hints of amber vanilla and wood it smells better after it 's been on the skin for a while it does have a slight feminine scent however this makes me like it more and makes me want him to wear it more it 's definetely for a confident man	15
1	eternity was signature scent of the late 80 's early 90 's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful classic status now it is one of the best on the market it smells classy clean zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it always worth having a bottle handy even if you do n't wear it everyday it is a yummy scrummy scent	15
1	i 've used this cream for years i like the way it feels and makes my skin look i 'd recommend it to anyone	15
1	this is by far my favorite mascara and i 've tried hundreds' i have very few and very short lashes this mascara pumps them up makes them look twice as long ! love love lov	15
1	like the powder blush this eye shadow is silky not chalky it goes on sheer and looks natural but beautiful all of the colors i 've tried are very nice toasted almond is a wonderful ivory american coffee is a rich brown \( but does n't go on too dark you can layer it for more drama \) caramel is a creamy beige this is a great product for everyday note you will need an eye shadow brush for this just as you need a blush brush it does not come with one	15
1	i have used this product for the past 16 years it is wonderful ! the super double face powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product the product comes with an application sponge goes on dry gives superb coverage ! i do n't even use my clinique concelar when i wear this product it is that good ! this product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin	15
1	as someone who really dislikes making up but needs a bit of cover in her face powder i have found clinique 's superpowder to be just the right product i have been using it for nearly ten years in between superpowder purchases i have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product it is truly no muss no fuss no foundation or concealers just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally no powdery bits sitting on the skin surface no flaking and stays on all day with nary a touch up just perfect	15
1	this is a fantastic product and lasts forever so the relatively steep cost is not so bad this is a great product for using under eye makeup because it makes the eye makeup slip on better and stay on longer or alone for a natural but still 'put together' look i love this product more than mascara and have n't found anything like it in other product lines	15
1	i have never found a compact foundation cream or powder that looked and lasted even remotely as well as a liquid foundation with a dusting of powder over it until now this is an amazing makeup and the best part is that it does n't take a whole lot of product to achieve perfect coverage my skin tends to be red but this does n't even hint at it plus it 's a nice matte without being too dry for everyday this is my time saving face perfecting miracle	15
1	mac lipglass is the absolute best there are plenty of colors to choose from super shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and does n't run the best colors are nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes it 's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer just pure shine	15
1	i'm really anal about scented flavored lipglosses especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla but mac lipglass is n't that vanilla ish at all ! it 's got very pigmented color it stays on a long time for a gloss and each tube lasts a long time do n't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off	15
1	i thought this stuff smelled fantastic and very similar to a lavender poundcake i guess smell is very subjective though so if you 're not sure about this one you might want to have a sniff at your local sephora or department store before purchasing	15
1	i received this as a gift and love it i do n't normally use dusting powders but this is light and silky the scent is very patchouli which i happen to like sort of reminds me of the head shops from the 60 's 70 's i especially like the fact that all lush products are natural without a lot of chemicals	15
1	this product is amazing ! i have very dry skin and this just soaks in leaving my skin soft and rejuvenated for days i even have used it for my shampoo times with good results there too	15
1	a time saver slap in on while still wet right after your shower instant moisturization if you 've got to jump in jump out and go and it smells delicious	15
1	this tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both as a rn with dermatology experience i have used many tools i like this one as it saves you from bruising or squishing your skin so it solves the problem with a minimum of damage if you have n't used anything like this it may take some getting used to but it 's way better than using your fingers i gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small	15
1	i love this scent it 's so fresh yet so distinctive light enough to wear to a ballet or other event where you 're in close qurters with others but distinct enough that people notice it every time i wear it i get compliments on how great i smell	15
1	i really smell the peach in this and thats why i love it i love how its mixed in with the powdery florals its not heavy its sexy without trying too hard and there is something old fashioned about it but it has a modern twist i love this perfume	15
1	soft sensual made me feel feminine and attractive my husand agrees	15
1	if you love the scent of the bathina line benefit has finally come out with an eau de toilette with the same scent i wear this scent everyday and i always get compliments i love to put the scent in my hair because it lingers in hair longer than skin many scents smell different on different skin types but maybe baby is a pretty true scent i guaruntee you will absolutely love this perfume and so will everyone around you	15
1	ok i have really large lips and for years i have tried everything to protect them get this tin for some reason the stick does n't work as well and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day it 's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily trust me i have tried everything even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick	15
1	i have been using this cream for almost 2 months now and the results are amazing my sun spots are lightened and it has also decreased the redness on my face i will continue to use it and highly recommend it	15
1	growing up worshiping the sun had finally taken its toll on my skin as of late i have noticed sun spots on my face chest and hands \( yuck ! \) my esthetician recommended i try murad 's age spot and pigment lightening gel in about a month i noticed the spots beginning to fade ! it is super light weight and soaks in fast too ! now all i have to do is remember the sunscreen	15
1	simplify simplify simplify ! that 's what i try to do with my beauty routine hence i was first attracted to laura mercier's facial cleanser by its name one step cleanser i'm staying with it because it works no more separate purchases for eyemake removers or deep cleansers one step cleanser removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean supple and nourished it 's both easy and effective	15
1	put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling your dark circles will be concealed and you 'll look wide awake	15
1	i like this product but am not sure it is worth the money i have bought other products for 5 at my local store and i seem to have similar results	15
1	i decided to try it out and have found the only soap i want to use the fragrance is great it does not overpower i guess the milling process gives the soap it 's texture which removes the need for all those bath shower accessories and 1 bar lasted over 2 months i will definitely be ordering more and trying other products this vendor carries	15
1	the ground almond hulls are gentle enough for daily use of the soap directly on the skin without being scratchy the scent is strong but not overpowering and both the soap and scent are long lasting this soap is also so moisturizing that my skin does n't require lotion as it does after most store brand soaps and shower gels this particular soap is my main shower bar and my great experience with it convinced me to return to bar soap after years of being a bath and body works shower gel and lotion fiend	15
1	body so fine is the most beautiful and luxurious cosmetic i ever had i recommend it because the description of benefit is absolutely real it 's the most delicious velvet and beautiful balm for the legs and the arms also the retro chic and vintage box and can are romantic and beautiful perfect for me	15
1	i got some of this body balm yesterday the lady at the benefit counter said that it would make my skin look luminescent like a victoria 's secret model she put a sample on one of my arms and i held it up to the other arm the difference was amazing ! the arm with the bathina looked smoother silker and had a pearlized look i ca n't stop raving about this stuff it is slightly expensive but the tin is really big \( and adorable \) and the supply of the balm is huge it should last a really long time this balm is one of the best products that benefit has	15
1	i could n't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging and it does look cute in the bathroom that being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs your calves look great without stockings i find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there 's nothing better on bare legs to add a glow to the skin especially to a tan try benefit 's flamingo fancy	15
1	i 've seen lots of negative feedback on the strawberry milkshake scent but i have to say i love it this lotion takes me back to my child hood it 's got a strawberry quick bubblegum smell to it i think it 's fun for summer days	15
1	clinique 's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever ! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it i have berrylicious \( sheer grape \) and cherry quartz \( sheer true red does n't look like it does on the color swatch \) and neither overwhelms my pale skin i would n't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse !	15
1	i use the dusty pink and i have never ever used a blush that looks so natural and makes my skin glow so healthy with or without the mineral foundation from youngblood just lovely highly recommended	15
1	i loveee this ring soo much it looks cute on my mdidle and index finger and the gloss is moisturizing with a touch of glitter all in one word glam ! !	15
1	here 's a gem of an idea for a small gift or stocking stuffer for the preteen girls on your list a cute lip gloss ring from hard candy the ring is heart shaped with a flip top filled with a lightly tinted sparkly lip gloss it comes in three shades and glosses heartbreaker which is a peach kiss me which is hot pink and yummy which is baby blue all are fruit scented boxed in a ring box with a faceted lid \( presentation you know \) it 's finger fun	15
1	mastering the stencils does require some practice but the color is good for blondes i also follow up the powder with an eyebrow pencil to make my eyebrows look a little more defined i think my eyebrows look better since using this product	15
1	i loved this product the stencils are easy to use and the instructions are easy to follow the browns are a bit dark so if you have red in your hair like i do you might want to start out light you can always go darker if you need to	15
1	after watching anastasia do eye brows on tv i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows after receiving this kit i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves i do however shape my daughters brows in conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person	15
1	i love the product as an afterthought this was sent from sephora where with every purchase you receive a bonus sample and even free shipping if you qualify wish i'd went to their site since i'm a frequent shopper there also oh well amazon is where i will buy books dvds etc	15
1	this powder is great it has great coverage without looking cakey i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it 's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched up a little more often than other powders i 've tried but it 's worth it	15
1	if you have smooth skin this product is not for you my skin had no human quality about it after i went through many procedures of bleaching and laser treatments i suffer from extreme skin dryness uneven and dull skin other lotions made my face look greasy or failed to give it that moisturised look i have tried many products for my extreme dry dull skin issues and this is the first product that has worked for me now my skin looks hydrated and normal it is quite a feat	15
1	wonderful shampoo i have color treated hair and my color stays shiny and my hair is thicker after i shampoo i use the shampoo daily and no longer have scalp problems from product buildup	15
1	this is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp very light and smells great	15
1	i was recommended this product for my son 's hair and have had many recommendations over the years since he has beautiful thick curly hair that can tend to be dry and frizzy i used a little of this product in his wet hair and it leaves it shiny with less frizz and more curls he is 10 and not crazy about the smell but i think it smells nice fantastic product	15
1	i purchased this product based on the reviews and i ca n't begin to tell you how glad i am to have the hair honey it is wonderful ! ! it leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy the smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater i will be using this for a long time to come	15
1	i just started using carols daughters products but i really like the hair honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front i just use a little water and hair honey tie a scarf for about ten minutes and my all natural new growth is smooth soft and exactly where i want it to be without using harsh gels sprays or spritzes i am using this and the cd healthy hair butter as a leave in i love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair	15
1	forgive me for the rhyme but the sentiment is true this product is rich but at the same time light after opening the jar i loved the way the hair honey smelled it has a sweet aroma but i did n't detect the cirtus smell in the product description i am only sorry i did n't get the larger size	15
1	really enjoy using this as body wash the smell is divine but the bubbles do n't last long if used as a bubble bath or shampoo moisturizing to my dry skin	15
1	i originally bought this item because i was hoping for the same scent that yankee candle produces in their candle line the smell is nice although it does n't reach out and grab you like true buttercream still it 's nice to shower with and you wo n't be disappointed with the lather i put a quarter sized amount on my shower puff and still had to ring out foam from it after i was finished also the lather is creamy and it just feels like it is moisturizing your skin all in all i am happy with my purchase i only gave 4 stars because i like a stronger scent but if you like more subtlety i'm sure you 'll enjoy it	15
1	this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage it stays on well it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important	15
1	wear make up every day and i usually wear foundation eyeliner mascara eyeshadow and lip gloss that 's my every day make up by the end of the day i have to get it off in order to sleep well lancome make up remover helps me a lot its very easy to use it takes off make up quickly and without scrubbing it 's gentle and not irritating it also smells nice though it 's kind of expensive it 's a good product	15
1	i use this everyother day before shampooing my hair is much less greasy after using it ! ! i 've also noticed that my hair seems to have more body at the roots it also has a very pleasant orange citrus scent this product is worth every cent i definitely recommend it for those with oily scalps and thinning hair	15
1	this is a must must must i love this kit all of the items included are awesome a must have you will probly not be disappointed gives the best smokey eye loo	15
1	i just got out of the shower a minute ago and i must say this is the best shampoo i 've ever bought my scalp has n't felt this clean and fresh in a long time washing my super thick and waist length hair did n't feel like a chore for once and i actually look forward to my next washing the smell reminds me of the hippie shops on haight street in san francisco i love it	15
1	for the price this product is great the bubbles were thick and rich and lasted a long time the scent was light and fragrant not over powering like some other products for those who love their bubble baths highly recommended	15
1	i 've been pleased with both the quantity and quality of the bubbles but the scent fades rather quickly if the scent lasted longer it would be much improved	15
1	i received this a a gift for valentine 's day this year it 's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam \( rather than big double bubbles \) it 's chock full of natural ingredients and no sls so it 's very gentle even for little ones i do however prefer the deep steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint	15
1	i love the scent of the grapefruit bergamot bubble bath this combination is suitable for men or women deep steep products are really first rate the foot scrub and lotions are well worth the money	15
1	i bought this but the perfume side was a clear color not purple colored and there is no color in the lip gloss it 's ust glittery but i love i	15
1	i used to sell iman when it was in a major department store this stuff would fly off the shelves too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else i stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else ! buy it you will not be disappointed	15
1	i have been using i man line of products for the past 5 years and have been a very happy customer this is my first time shopping for i man makeup online and i realize that amazon com has it for half price this is a fantastic deal and the product is beautiful for all skin tone my friends comment that i look flawless	15
1	knowing how i love everything pink a dear friend of mine gave this to me as a present i love the scent it 's not overpowering but has that lovely and alluring smell it 's so fragrant and i feel like i'm forever in a garden full of freshly bloom beautiful pink roses one of the simple pleasures in life truly pink by vera wang leave a scent of you behind wholeheartedly recommended	15
1	for a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used i found h2o plus to be amazing stuff non greasy no heavy scents it 's worth every penny	15
1	face oasis is n't like any other moisturizer i 've tried one application makes my skin appear plump and well hydrated even if i 've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day it is n't at all greasy absorbs quickly and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup the guys i 've introduced it to have raved about it as well !	15
1	like most others i fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years i had to buy the latest greatest design in razors with each new design the blades got more and more expensive until i realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money about a year ago i bought a merkur razor and have not regretted it if you are a newbie to this type of razor you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique then enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket	15
1	i have hard facial hairs \( thanks dad ! ! \) and after being gilette user \( last used mac 3 \) i finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with double edge \( de \) razor and blades merkur are the first ones i have used after the multi edge blades and after 4 5 shaves i am getting closer shaves \( w no irritation \) than by using mutli edge ones also to get better results i would recommend a badger brush which really softens the skin before these de blades with a good heavy razor \( merkur is a good one \) can smoothly get your facial stubs good luck !	15
1	this is the second time i have ordered these blades for my husband he has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he 's ever used that last anywhere near this long regular blades dull almost right away \( sorry he 's not here or i 'd ask for the details from him i do n't know how long a long time is \) but at 50 he 's tried a lot of blades ! he says never buy him anything else again so i guess these are the best ! ! !	15
1	this product is awesome nice texture great tingling feeling and very smooth clean feeling after use but i'm not sure if you should use it daily as exfoliators should only be used 2 3x week because they 're too abrasive so just remember that otherwise this is definitley a top notch exfoliator	15
1	the 2nd day i shampoo d with this bar it was amazing the compliments i received it made my hair right after going to the salon shiny i 'd highly reccomend this to anyone	15
1	like all lush shampoo cakes it does a great job in cleaning hair and is nice and sudsy i find the smell to be nothing to write home about yes my hair was shiny but it tends to be with all of their products do n't be scared of the glitter though it 's barely there all in all i prefer new and karma komba to this one	15
1	during the winter months i have flaky skin under my beard and on my face this product has prevented that problem the last 3 winters that i 've used it i 'd recomend for that use i do n't think it has much of a scent at all certainly not like most soaps and skin care products	15
1	this is a wonderful addition to taking a bath ! the size is very nice quite large and makes for an awesome spa like exprerience in your own home ! the sponge is clean and has no smell rinses out easily ! highly recommend	15
1	when i ordered i didnt read the word double so when i got it n put it on it was pretty thick and i was like whooa but its good stuff just heavy for me so im ordering a regular one now	15
1	as someone who really dislikes making up but needs a bit of cover in her face powder i have found clinique 's superpowder to be just the right product i have been using it for nearly ten years in between superpowder purchases i have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product it is truly no muss no fuss no foundation or concealers just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally no powdery bits sitting on the skin surface no flaking and stays on all day with nary a touch up just perfect	15
1	this cologne smells great a guy i know wears it and whenever he hugs me i smell this and well he smells fantastic in fact the way he smelled was one of the first things that interested me in him i'm a big fan of the original curve cologne which smells really nice as well boys men ca n't go wrong wearing either of them	15
1	this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright shiny hair for me i have nice hair to begin with \( if i do say so myself \) but i used this in conjunction with one of lush 's conditioners \( american cream \) and my friends told me i had shampoo model hair that day i'm not crazy about the beer ish smell which is why i 'll give it a four rating however it does n't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it	15
1	i have terrible skin lots of scars stretch marks burns bruises acne etc but people always come up to me comment on how beautiful my skin is \( due to the makeup \) dermablend is way too dry \( i like to mix it with a little lotion before applying \) but it stays on even in water if it looks a bit flaky pale ghostly put some lotion over it any type of makeup looks bad if you do n't know how to apply it duh	15
1	i'm a sort of sweaty type so i usually like an antiperspirant deodorant but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash and it 's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy aromarant is quick and easy to use does n't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge	15
1	it smells beautiful and is very relaxing by far my favorite out of so many i 've tried !	15
1	i recieved a couple of these while in college as a gift and have been using them ever since up until now i have aways had a hard time finding them i have been usinghte same two for years now and i gotta tell you washclothes come and go but these still look almost new after all these years i am so glad i can stock up on these ! ! buy them you will ove them i have ultra sensitive skin and these washclothes are outstanding for exfoliating	15
1	i bought this for a frriend and she love it so i have to give it 5 since it was not that expensive the only problem i had was the item was not giftwrap as i pay 2 99 to have giftwrap and it was n't so the gift wrapping option does not work very well with the seller	15
1	subtle yet powerful ! i love this scent i actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance many compliments from men women a little spritz does the trick ! you can also purchase a sheer moisturizing body spray perfect for daytime wear especially during the summer pricey but definately worth it ! !	15
1	so i 've been wanting this particular fragrance for a long time now and my boyfriend finally purchased it for me for christmas it arrived on time with no problems and also came along with various perfume samples what can i say \? it was exactly i expected to be no disappointments	15
1	i bought this conditioner for my daughter 's hair the smell is wonderful ! ! ! plus the product works great ! ! ! it now comes with a pump at least mine did which makes it easy to use it leaves my aa daughter 's hair soft and managable	15
1	i really like this product because i have a natural do products that are too heavy do n't work this is perfect for my hair it makes it easier to style and it leaves my hair soft and smelling good	15
1	i have tried many different products and this one is the best i rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else i have tried four stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it you can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem especially if under makeup	15
1	i use this on the ocasional hormonal breakout and it is super it is easy to apply goes on clear and is very powerful it works to clear up that spot in record time i 'd highly recommend it	15
1	although i find this soap a bit sweet \( almost bubble gum sweet \) my daughter \( teen \) loves it all little girls would love this especially with the glitter stars and random colors we get it often the bathroom smells nice after a shower too	15
1	what a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow paula dorf says where are the brights \? not here and calls the shadows softly muted that is true but do n't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow it 's also named glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it the selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone i bought the gold which is subtle but is still gold i love the way it goes on and it 's suitable for day or night paula dorf will never have you looking like a clown but i do n't find these shades boring either	15
1	i absolutely love this chanel foundation it is lightweight and yet provides fair to good coverage i like this foundation because it does not feel heavy and it is water based it can be worn in the daytime or evening use with chanel loose powder and chanel concealer for a perfectly flawless finish	15
1	due to the ravages of 60 years worth of gravity nursing babies and losing a lot of weight the girls need a little help \( actually they need a lot of help but we wo n't go there ! \) i have worn bra inserts from the fabric store the ones that kind of remind you of a shoulder pad they do the job but create a line across the bra cup and have to constantly be adjusted during the day i love the silicone inserts iinserted in your bra they look like the real deal and since they cling to your skin they stay in place all day i call them my ex plants ! love 'em !	15
1	i have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked initially i was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised it certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes it may seem expensive but a little goes a very very long way has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating and i have sensitive skin try it i do n't think you 'll be disappointed i was n't	15
1	if you need something to get you going in the morning shock therapy will do it we 're talking major minty shower gel here your skin will be tingling the smell clears the mind and gets the blood flowing to the brain a gift note this would be a good gift for someone who does n't like flowery bath products even guys would like this	15
1	i use this constantly i 've bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at sephora i do n't blend it in though i dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry not too much but it 's still so vibrant that a little goes a long way i 've reccomended this to everyone	15
1	this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage it stays on well it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important	15
1	i was worried about buying this kit because of the cost but it 's worth every penny in less than a week my feet have gone from cracked and peeling to soft and healthy this kit is amazing	15
1	my boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck and he was very skeptical about using this now he does n't get any ingrown hairs and he does n't pick at them anymore he will not live without it now and we both recommend it !	15
1	tend skin was introduced to me for after waxing ingrown hairs but she said the secret was that it stopped itching from mosquito bites and within 24 hrs any pimple and just blooming pimple are gone ! ! ! i introduced this to friends at work and now everyone uses it we all have clearer skin when nothing else \( even pro active \) did n't work	15
1	the scent is so unforgettable fresh and sexy and sweet and it 's just the best among the best	15
1	this is a 'must have' fragrance it has an exotic scent that will have everyone around you asking what perfume do you have on \? it can be worn day or night the entire burberry line is fantastic	15
1	i'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents the candy apple is definitely the most accurate and i 'd sell my soul if i could only continue buying it on its own but the other 2 are good too the cotton candy is awesome but not 100 on accuracy and the cherry sno cone makes me start slobbering when i smell it highly recommended	15
1	this stuff is awesome if you have dry coarse or damaged hair this is lush creamy and lathers up well this is a wonderful luxury shampoo you will feel like a queen star when you wash your hair with this the smells is fresh and yummy i love using this stuff except i cannot use this every day as it will weigh my hair down my hair is fine and straight and has some natural wave in the back i highly recommend this product and will buy it again	15
1	i originally wanted the black ginger aromatic candle but after reading the reviews it seemed that the red currant is the all around favorite the smell is nice but i think i expected something a bit different the candle 's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated and it seems to be burning slowly the candle itself is fine quality and comes packaged nicely ! if i found a scent that i liked a bit better i would be 100 pleased	15
1	i received the soku lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled ! the box itself is decorative and i re used it as a pencil holder on my desk the scent is very aromatic and long lasting i had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house i was very pleased	15
1	this candle is the ultimate pleasure ! it 's smell is not over powering but is pleasurable at the same time you will be sure to love it as much as i do !	15
1	i have tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market and was dissatisfied with the results until trying this combo my curls are well formed and bouncy and i use less styling product plus this line smells great ! it has a light citrusy smell that i wish they 'd bottle into perfume i even got my boyfriend \( who has curly hair like mine \) to buy and use these products by letting him sample mine i am hooked	15
1	i 've been using avon products since i was a teen i started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel i will be 60 this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either though i am a dry skinned redhead contrary to what someone else here said i find that it does absorb very quickly i buy it because it is not oily oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn and this gives me no problems at all also i have sensitive skin so i have to use hypoallergenic makeup this fills that bill too try it ! ! it 's great ! !	15
1	i agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice it is very strong and i realized after spraying it twice it only needed once most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette very much worth the money i was complimented on it the entire day it does not resemble lemon pledge to me at all	15
1	i tried the lemon sugar perfume and i am absolutly in love with it it is like no other perfume i have ever smelled before i will probably be using it the rest of my life i hope they never stop making it i think everyone should try it the scent is lemony and sugar just like it says it is light and last a very long time i am already going to order a bigger bottle tomorrow do not just take my world for it order it today and experience something great and new	15
1	this fragrance smells great if you have used the awesome fresh lemon sugar shower gel it smells exactly the same it smells much better than the other sugar fragrance that has been around a long time this one is clean and fresh and uplifting	15
1	this is a very lemony smell and the sugar takes away the sour 'edge' of the lemon it is simply only that lemon and sugar then it gets warmer and airy throughout the day if you want to just try it get a sample size one from ebay or a mini perfumes website if your considering the more expensive clean fragrance but are n't sure about the price fresh lemon sugar is similar in scent the only thing being left out is the laundry 'air' fragrance	15
1	not your typical thick floral smelling perfume this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises like lemon juice mixed with sugar it 's a seasonal perfume \( i ca n't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter \) it smells very crisp fresh and clean which i enjoy a lot but i imagine others would not the same things i like about this perfume could smell like a cleaning product to others go to your fridge get a lemmon squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar if you enjoy the smell you get buy this perfume i highly recommend it if not stick to something more traditional and vanilla floral like ana sui 's dolly girl	15
1	i am in love with this product it smells wonderful once you put it on and it really seems to relax sore muscles the only problem i have with it is i go through it too fast \( i probably use more than i need to \)	15
1	after a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8 hours and a brutal workout after i came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience i have ever had by myself with a bath bar ! \) the cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar the cool air in the bathroom mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing blissful enjoyable shower i feel great ! i 'll sleep great tonight ! this experience has made me a lush customer for life	15
1	i havent gotten the treatment myself yet but my husband loves it dont rub it on too long or you 'll have too much it melts quickly when it touches skin i love the peppermint cinnamon mixture scent and he likes the heat it provides it leaves a coating of the buttery stuff on your skin so wear a shirt to bed so it can soak in and moisturize	15
1	i bought this after using other murad products and loving them i like this but i would n't say i love it first it 's a bit overpriced i can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price the toner itself is decent but does n't seem to clean as deeply as other toners however for those who find toners to be a bit harsh this may be a good option non drying and does n't have that toner burn overall a decent product but not one i am sure i would re purchase	15
1	so glad to find this hard to find item ! i have tried every kind of polish dryer but it did the surface and left a tacky mess underneath for years i have used dry and shine with the great success it goes on like lotion drys to a haze and you buff it off to a beautiful hard shine and dry nails i love it ! ! ! it is magic ! ! ! !	15
1	a clean and refreshing scent not heavy at all its top notes are citrus based and this is appropriate for day or night wear it is one of my favorites it reminds me a little of happy for women which i love but do n't wear because of its distinctly feminine smell cudos to clinique happy is a terrific man 's cologne it smells clean but not like laundry soap \( which too many men 's colognes smell like these days \)	15
1	i have ordered a few of these as gifts and the recipients are always delighted responses i have heard about the products are marvelous ! heavenly ! and to die for ! and keep in mind that these are ladies who take there bath times seriously ! ! ! the range of flavors makes it easy to give this gift again and again the order always comes pre wrapped suitable for gift giving you ca n't go wrong with giving this as a gift i give this seller my highest recommendation ! kudos	15
1	i love to wear safari several times a week someone will ask what kind of perfume i am wearing and comment how nice it smells i will continue to wear it until i can no longer get it someone said it is discontinued does anyone know \?	15
1	my skin was winter dry and i expected this product to have richer moisturizing qualities the scent is nice but quite strong not a 5 star product as i usually get at body shop but works fine for more balanced skin	15
1	i love this scent it smells warm and spicy on my skin the eau de parfum is strong but not overpowering at all and the dry down is wonderful it also lasts all day long which is great because i'm a spray it and forget it kinda gal	15
1	this fragrance is both sexy and playful it truly embodies the essence of a woman both men and women find it to be a truly amazing scent	15
1	these candles smell true to their names make the room smell nice but are n't overpowering they do smell good when you burn more than one scent too	15
1	i light this candle every other day in my bedroom because i enjoy this scent so much it is a very light scent but the smell does fill a room quickly if you like the amazing grace and pure grace lines from philosophy you will like the clean crisp white candle the candle is high quality and comes in a very nice container that i did n't want to throw away great for gifts	15
1	tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers i 've ever purchased they stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise quick and virtually painless and when they do go dull all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so they arrive back good as new you ca n't beat that !	15
1	i'm sure that you do n't need any more assurance but just to let you know i 've had my tweezerman 's for over 5 years now they are still sharp ! plus if you ever were to drop them they probably would n't be significantly damaged these tweezers are a must have	15
1	i got this as a gift from my mother last year this product saved my hands and feet ! it helped them stay soft no more itchy ankles or knuckles i preferred to use this at night but i do use it on my feet almost everyday before i put my socks on for the day it moisturizes without too heavy of a feeling	15
1	i like this lotion it is moisturizing retexturing but sort of waxy hence the 4 stars but it is still good stuf	15
1	very moisturizing and smells nice too the sea minerals and exfoliating ingredients keep my cuticles looking good and help cut down on hangnails too i apply lots of it at bedtime	15
1	i love this fragance it 's my favorite no matter where i go if i am wearing this perfume i always get compliments it has a very floral sort of sultry scent to it i love it	15
1	givenchy 's very irresistible is magnificent ! floral yet spicy overtones with a touch of black current in a rose peony base better than bob mackie 's perhaps perfume and infinitely complex so that the scent is never tiresome irresistible lasts all day and is a fragrance that captivates this perfume is different than the typical scents that arrive on the market and well worth a try !	15
1	love love love this scent i have received many compliments about it long lasting and definitely addictive i think its more of a late fall and winter scent if i do say so myself	15
1	this product is perfect for dreadlocks i buy it whenever i am in the us i live in the caribbean and even in the extreme heat this stuff is the best for my hair type	15
1	i have shoulder length natural dredlocs and while this did n't lock my hair it did smooth out the flyaways around the crown of my head it also has a great light scent that does n't compete with the other hair care products i use like the vanila leave in conditioner and the hair butter	15
1	it smells good and made me hair relly soft it did lighten it a little bit but i also used the blonde with it after a while i think my hair will get even lighter highly recommended	15
1	i love this conditioner ! it smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk ! my hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour regardless i recommend this product highly especially for dry damged hair i recommend this product in conjunction with new ! \( hair \) solid shampoo bar also made by lush cosmetics	15
1	i 've had my marilyn hair treatment for some 3 months and it makes my hair smell great ! kind of like a smooth scent in my hair it did n't really lighten my hair but it smells great and it did add some extra softness to it	15
1	got this sample from a friends mom who worked for a major department store and i loved it but i could n't believe it was a scent from clinique ! love that it 's light and has little hints of powder and citrus to it i definitely recommend this scent especially for the springtime great for daytime wear	15
1	the gel has a slight tingling sensation but it does n't itch or burn and after using it for a few times the tingling stopped i love this stuff ! ! ! give it a chance it works great	15
1	i purchased the tui shampoo and conditioner and although it is watery it lathers very well and leaves your hair squeaky clean i wear my hair natural with no chemicals and it held my natural curls in place the entire day my hair did not dry out nor did it become poofy all day i love carol 's daughter and i am thankful for her products	15
1	i use this conditioner as well as the other pumpkin products having bleached hair i did n't think i 'd have healthy looking and feeling hair until i discovered these products they are worth their weight in gold ! they leave my hair soft manageable and healthy looking and the smell is wonderful	15
1	i found iman lipsticks from the kits to be not as nice as the picture but the eyeshadows are very soft with high pigments in beautiful colors the pencils good quality and very versatile overall the kits are a great buy	15
1	i was so surprised by this eyeshadow i usually buy cheap brands from the drugstore but when i tested this on my hand i had to have it ! be mine is a light shimmery pink paired with a soft charcoal pink usually looks weird on me but this shadow is so soft smooth and lightweight that it glides on and does n't look cakey since i bought this i hardly wear any of the cheap stuff i own this is worth the price and now i'm saving up to buy a few more shades	15
1	i just love this product it takes away the dead skin on your face and leaves it sparkling clean there are little diamond flakes left as well you face looks radiant and young i will not be without this produc	15
1	worth every penny someone gave this red currant soap as a house warming gift and i became obsessed i really cannot tell you how good of quality these products are the candles burn forever and really scent the place up but not in an ovepowering fake way i ca n't wait until they make body perfume in red currant all of them smell good however cheers from berkeley c	15
1	ive never liked spicy or musky scents but im in love with burberry brit its got a great musky overtone but its not too heavy like most fragrances like it the scent sticks around all day which is also a plus i 've a ways used light scents like romance by ralph lauren and ck one but burberry brit is easily my new favourite im actually here to buy my second bottle	15
1	this is alittle heavier than usual summer skin products ielight and non greasy but when you are maintaining your tan and or recovering from skin peeling this cream is rich and works great ! the ingredients are rich and they really make the skin feel smooth	15
1	this is a treat to wear i alternate it with my secret sparkling lily clear gel deodorant the fresh deodorant does n't dry my skin and my it rubbery feeling but it keeps me from sweating it smells just like fresh 's sugar perfume sweet and lemony but does n't last as long that 's why i only gave it 4 stars it also does n't cake or pill up like other deodorants this is my favorite deodorant	15
1	this lip gloss is so wonderful i do n't know where to start long lasting shine perfect color goes on smooth does n't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do mild fruity flavor i highly recommend this lip gloss to anyone the expense is worth it 100x over	15
1	i have been using this mascara for years i have tried other brands drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else i have ever tried why \? this mascara is smooth it does not flake off and fall into your eyes it does not ever look clumpy it is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes i would not say that this mascara will make your lashes a mile long or dangerously thick or whatever hype you hear from other brands those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara just a simple nice natural looking mascara that wo n't irritate your eyes	15
1	i do n't remember when i first tried this product but now i 've been using it for years and i love it ! this is a great eye color base it goes on smoothly without rubbing or pulling the skin and provides a smooth base for powder eye color i wear it every day under my eye makeup it makes my eyeshadow last all day without creasing or fading plus it comes in many colors to compliment whatever colors of eyeshadow you 're wearing try it and you 'll love it too	15
1	in one month this product made my skin so smooth and refreshed that a facial scar from six years ago disappeared from my cheek	15
1	instant non greasy moisture for the tender eye area smooths out fine wrinkles	15
1	this product is great ! ! ! i wear it during the day under my moisturizer but the biggest difference is when i put a drop or two on at bedtime one night i was really beat too beat to wash my face so i tried putting a little on over everything instead it worked great when i wear it at night my skin looks dewy and fresh and soft like i'm 19 again ! \( i'm almost 40 ! \) i ca n't say that everyone will have the same results i do all i know is that i am very very happy to have found this product !	15
1	i hsve used clinique moisturing gel for years and this was the first time i had the pump what a thrill as only a little bit is extracted and that is all one needs	15
1	great product from a company that only offers innovative wonderful products this product should n't cost this much though it costs less at authorized bb retail outlets and buying bb products online does n't guarantee the consumer that they 're getting authentic bb so beware check out www bumbleandbumble com for authorized retailers	15
1	i love the shine lip glosses offer but really do dislike the stickiness when wearing a gloss lip prints come off on glasses \( paper cups are the worst ! \) napkins and whoever you 've just buzzed found the answer to the stickies with chanel 's aqualumiere line the lipsticks give the slick shine without the telltale spots it can be blotted and still shines as if that were n't enough it 's spf15 my favorite shade is macao a rosy pink	15
1	only drawback it stays wetter onyour face prior to shaving than the competitive stuffi e afta which dries quickly so youcan get to shaving quicker	15
1	i like this cologne although my wife uses it mostly the fragrance is incredible and from time to time i use it as an air freshner as well it is subtle yet long lasting and i may only recommend it	15
1	inis has a very fresh crisp clean scent that i love it 's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering which is what i like about it it 's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it whenever i wear it people always sniff and make comments like what are you wearing \? and mmm ! you smell so good	15
1	this is a really great scent but it could of been better i think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals i mean seriously animals want to smell nice too	15
1	inis has become my favourite perfume every time i wear it i am always being asked what perfume are you wearing \? it is light fresh fragrant not overpowering but makes an impression i have tried lots of perfumes but none compare to inis the fact it is not tested on animals is a bonus and also it is not too expensive ca n't recommend it enough buy and try	15
1	got perfume for my wife she loves it me too of course	15
1	this is a great product but way too expensive on this site you can find it for 28 00	15
1	i 'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when i tried burberry brit 's eau de toilette one day i could n't believe how wonderful the scent was especially after it had been on for a while i splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time \( even with almost daily use it 's still mostly full \) i consider this to be my signature scent and get many compliments on it	15
1	i got this as a gift i had tested the eau de parfum version at a department store cosmetics' counter and was less than thrilled however the edt was just right for me ! i believe in signature fragrances so i 'll let this be the signature of one of my many moods	15
1	used the cleansing foam then bought the moisture cream whatever is in rice bran is truly wonderful it cleanses without any dryness and a rosy glow has returned to my skin have stopped using my old department store stuff replacing 4 of those products with just these 2 with better results good value on both they should offer a deal on the shampoo and conditioner too	15
1	i love the smell and i much prefer the solid perfume to the spray just subtle enough	15
1	i absolutely love this fragrance when i put this on i get a warm musky scent that lasts for hours i put the spray cologne version of falling in love on top to brighten it up a bit when i feel like it it is subtle but i think it is a very sexy and warm scent and not at all overpowering definitely something my husband wants to be near	15
1	i was unsure about this item in the store but took a gamble i cut 1 3 of the bar up and crumbled it and i was n't particularly impressed with the smell of it dry so i grabbed the rest and tossed it all in wow ! it was so silky and smooth against the skin i jumped out and grabbed my husband to join me ! with some nice classical music on in the background and a tahitian vanilla candle you 'll think your back in the womb all safe and warm the bubbles did n't last very long but it leaves the skin silky and comfortable with out a perfumey scent	15
1	my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid there 's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar i really like that it 's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar it 's great for those who do n't want a flowery bath but who ca n't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar i wish i 'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies plus this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb really probably any bomb would do good stuff	15
1	bubbles nicely but does not smell like hot milk i 've never tried milky bar so i have no idea if the two compare hot milk \? is comforting though its like being wrapped in warm fluffy towels straight from the dryer	15
1	this is the one for you i love love love lavender and this soap is it concentrated lavender goodness very dark purple in color and complex in scent layering wonderful light texture to soap	15
1	i bought this on a whim because i just remodeled my house after hurricane katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub nice to take long baths in so of course i needed some bubble stuff the bath bombs smell wonderful my whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until i used them all i even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful \( for about a week \) ! the bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve the fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day i loved them and will definitely buy more	15
1	forget all those other so called good colognes out there happy for men is the best smelling one of them all ! it may be expensive but it is well worth it example i sprayed down a shirt with it and send it home with my girlfriend at her request ! she requested this because she wanted have something of mine that she could sleep with it while we are apart that is how good it is ! enjoy	15
1	for me happy has a subtley orange undertone and evokes a sense of vibrancy and youth as with the signature female clinique scents you do n't need much to cause a stir and it always leaves a lingering subtle trail of sophistication	15
1	as we 've heard it 's not easy being green it 's more than easy it 's delightful if you 're an avobath bath ballistic infused with avocado \( hence the name \) and olive oil it moisturizes skin the fragrance is fresh rather citrusy thanks to lemongrass and rosewood bath water is a lovely shade of green rather like new spring grass if there 's glitter in it i did n't find any which was as i wished it 's suggested for morning i 'd relax with an avobath any time of day	15
1	i love the fresh scent of the avobath there 's just nothing like it it smells like springtime to me i have yet to notice any glitter in an avobath bath \( and i 've taken about 10 \) so if you 're glitter shy do n't let that stop you from trying this one	15
1	i like to eat avocados i like avocado face masks and now i can bathe in eau de avocado ! this bath bomb is possibly my favorite very softening great color \( turns your tub into a nice green lagoon \) and great lemony scent i did n't find the glitter to be very noticeable so do n't worry about that stock up on this one	15
1	kai is like lying in a meadow in the warmth of the sun with a gentle breeze and the aroma of a million sweet flowers embracing you oh how i love it	15
1	o k these glosses are just plain yummy ! actually they do n't taste like lipglosses at all which is a good thing no one wants waxy orchemical flavored gloss thatmakes you want to throw up right \? all the flavors are amazingly delicious each one tastes just like sweets the colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky they go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle i wish the tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky overall nice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes	15
1	i am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss i own over 300 different brands of gloss and this is by far one of my favorites it 's a pretty good deal at only 28 for so many colors i like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket it 's fun to layer the different colors as well and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors they also taste amazing each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar it goes especially well with the aquolina pink sugar fragrance for a sugar themed cosmetic experience	15
1	i bought this cream after i tried about a dozen other brands and i loved it it a bit pricy but it worth every penny i am 24 so i bought it to smooth out starting lines that i had and prevent new ones it worked ! now i look like i am 20 again	15
1	was using philosophy 's various light scents discovered this burberry london sample in my last sephora shipment went to macy 's and bought the set for under 77 lotion shower gel and 3 3 oz fragrance fretted over price until i actually used the products layering them recieved so many compliments ! not an old lady 's perfume not strong nor weak it has an elegant floral fragrance top notes rose clementine and honeysuckle heart notes tiare flower jasmine and peony dry down notes sandalwood veil of musk and patchouli all my favorites	15
1	one of the best perfumes i have tried in a long time my boyfriend goes crazy over it	15
1	reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to especially if you 're not already using lush products it does n't 'sud up' much and feels a little bit muddy and grainy do n't fret though ! it will certainly clean your hair and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices \( almost as good as arabian bright \) the highlights are not something that come with one or two washings but with many many washings and they are very subtle but there the only reason i do n't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is and i needed to use another conditioning product with it	15
1	i bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands hydrated and soft after leaving them on for half an hour with the glamour gloves gel my hands felt reborn i could n't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated i 've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they 're still doing the job i 've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and do n't know how well they work but these are very high quality	15
1	i first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester i fell in love with the sweet sugary light smell of it and so did my husband it 's perfect for all seasons since it 's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you 're wearing i 've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet now i want to try some of their other fragrances if they are half as good as this they win in my book	15
1	this is the first bronzer i actually finished this gives the most natural finish and blends really well i like that it 's matte because i'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer ever since i started using this i'm just addicted and ca n't live without it it gives the skin a really natural healthy looking flush i 've got medium olive skin and i use light my skin does n't look orangey or dirty try it and i'm sure you 'll like it make sure you use a really good brush	15
1	i love this fragrance ! it reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of hawaii if you 've ever visited the islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes and thought to yourself what is that heavenly smell \? this is it ! there is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as kai my only concern about this fragrance line is the cost but how i feel and think when i am wearing it makes it all worth it	15
1	this mattifying moisturizer is great ! it definitely helps with my oily skin and works all day long i ca n't say more than enough positive effects this moisturizer has had on m	15
1	i am satisfied wih both the product and the delivery time i would order it again	15
1	this foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look while also giving a good coverage i 've been using this foundation for years all year long and it is one of my favorites not too heavy and not too light it 's the perfect foundation being asian american and with a light complexion finding a good color match had always been a problem unless i spent 40 for a bottle of makeup zhen is one of the best deals around clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside	15
1	this product is truly amazing ! the application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you will have long long lashes my lashes are medium length but when i use this people who know me thing i am wearing falsies this stuff rocks ! i 've never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does	15
1	i had an amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on it so happened that i needed new tweezers i read the reviews and thought i 'd give these a try wow i ca n't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers i have ever owned they almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp it is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair tweezerman tweezers rock !	15
1	i'm sure that you do n't need any more assurance but just to let you know i 've had my tweezerman 's for over 5 years now they are still sharp ! plus if you ever were to drop them they probably would n't be significantly damaged these tweezers are a must have	15
1	i purchased this one month ago and i will never use anything else blends wonderfully great colors i bought it for my daughter from amazon sephora as well great product	15
1	these are great for removing excess oil when you ca n't stop and wash your face or do n't want to disturb your makeup i prefer this brand because they unfold to twice their size when you pull them out instead of the size of a half dollar like the rest of them	15
1	i have been wearing obsession since 1986 and it has definitely not gone out of style every day i get a comment from someone about how good i smell my boss even bought some obsession for his wife because he likes it so much on me this is my favorite perfume	15
1	i'm a cologne junkie and of my vast collection armani mania is clearly my 1 i'm into my 3rd bottle of this potion and it continues to bring on the compliments and inquiries of what 's that cologne you 're wearing it smells fantastic ! you cannot repeat cannot go wrong here a modern classic	15
1	this is by far the best shampoo and conditioner set i have used i have very fine very straight and very long hair that breaks easily but not with this shampoo and conditioner this set makes it smooth but not oily and so when i brush my hair there is no yanking going on my hair is noticeably more shiny and soft it has a very pleasant scent and it is all natural what a great way to pamper yourself ! definitely worth the extra investment	15
1	i was a bit apprehensive to purchase a candle this expensive but i was very pleased with the scent clean burning and look of the candle and the packaging it came in the havana is a scent that both my husband and i enjoyed	15
1	the cream is great it instantly gets absorbed after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries \( which causes black circle appearences \) i suffered from chronic dark circles this cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness i would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me i still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes but never the less i find it effective	15
1	have had dark circles caused by pigmentation for four years and have tried everything have been using hylexin for just five days and honestly its been amazing i saw all the bad reviews and im glad they didnt stop me for the first time in years i dont need a concealer will continue to keep you posted as i hope in the nxt week or two not to have any circles at all \( if it continues this way \) i think mayb the product doesnt work for hereditery circles	15
1	i love how this product works and feels on my skin ! ! does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out ! makes skin feel cool and clean ! ! i have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out or be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin but that was n't the case my skin did n't break out nor is this product drying highly recommend !	15
1	i used this relaxer for the first time after using many brand name ones i was impressed with the results it leaft my hair with much needed moisture and very shiny i normally apply the realxer myself at home but i choose to go professional to really capture the promises that this product states the smell was not noticeable which was good since most chemicals are so harsh and strong it did n't burn my scalp like most have the quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give i think that it was worth the price ! i 'll be buying it again	15
1	this is not sticky lip gloss the rose tone is easy to wear it's sweet and natural tone you can mix colors and than create new color on your lips ! ! you don't need to shop tons of glosses and lip sticks this is it ! plus the palette case is cute	15
1	i love this formula for my thick naturally curly slightly hilighted hair it does a great job cleaning without stripping and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down i did get a good deal at my salon 9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner	15
1	to tell you the truth i have tried everything on my hair to take away the frizz nothing really worked at all but biosilk is a miracle ! the first time i tried it i noticed a major difference in my hair just add a little bit to your hair and it will immediately smooth it out adding shine and softness it will also not weigh your hair down or make it too greasy just do n't use that much of it i mostly use this with my flat iron and i get amazing results i happen to like the smell of it it reminds me of being in a salon ! try the shampoo and conditioner as well	15
1	i have wavy and coarse hair and i have a whole lot of it i use this product after shower on damp hair and then blow dry this product really works and makes my hair soft and silky and it gives the hair nice movement and makes it easy to style my hairdresser who has similiar hair as mine recommended me this product and she said she loves it i am very happy to find this product before wasting a lot of money on trying others that do n't work it is a bliss	15
1	my hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and i 've used it ever since it makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good just a little of biosilk goes a long way gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair i definitely reccomend it	15
1	i was hooked on sebastian 's shine serum forever then i switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews it makes it just as shiny as the sebastian but for my thick wavy hair it is easier to apply i only need about a quarter size amount way less than any other product it has a nice soft finish so if you like sebastian and redkin 's shine serums you 'll like this i'm not going to go as far as to say it 's a miracle worker it makes your hair shinier it helps a little with my frizz but does n't depouf	15
1	i have straight hair but it is super long and thick past my waist so i have problems combing it and keeping it smooth biosilk is the best stuff i have found to detangle after washing and keep my hair soft after it is dry i have tried everything else and i mean everything and nothing compares i'm so hooked i have bought it by the gallon and believe me that is not cheap ! it even smells great it 's not greasy and it is fantastic for giving or receiving massages too	15
1	this is truly one of the best hand and nail creams out there it is quickly absorbed and not at all greasy i put some on before i walk out the door in the morning and again before bedtime and it has made a real difference in the softness of my hands and the health of my cuticles hangnails have always been a problem for me but this product keeps them under control as long as i apply it regularly love it !	15
1	i really like this mascara i only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and i have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out otherwise it is the only mascara that does n't cause me to loose a ton of lashes everything else from estee lauder bourjois to great lash causes me loose a lot of lashes i also like that if i cry i do n't wind up looking like a raccoon it subtly melts away no mess ! it washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible not flaky	15
1	this mascara is great i 've tried many and this is the only one that does n't smudge all over the place the only drawback is the price it 's triple what drugstore brands cost	15
1	follow the cleanser with the komenuka bijin skin lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of sake in fact this cleansing toner does contain sake along with rice bran seaweed aloe yeast glycyrrhizate orange lemon matricaria algae luffa cylindrica and fountain water the toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion the rebecca review	15
1	this salve is just perfect under bliss 's softening socks it 's amazing how much you can smear on leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks it leaves feet renewed use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies	15
1	this is for sure one of my new favorite sets the scent is nice and clean the lotion and gel left a very nice scent also	15
1	i bought this perfume for my husband and both of us love it very sexy and yet a clean scent at the same time it 's light enough to be perfect for the man who normally does n't wear perfumes yet elegant enough for the man who does	15
1	this razor rocks the proper technique is easy to learn short light strokes down then up \( if you want a closer shave \) this gives me hardly any nicks compared to the gillette mach 3 and is way easier to unclog than the shick quattro the sample blade continues to last with about 2 shaves a week since dec 2006 typical razor cartridges would n't even come close to that longevity and they cost about 4 times as much as the replacement merkur blades which are 50 cents each i am just doing facial shaving with it at this point hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving i expect i 'll be using merkur for the rest of my life	15
1	i'm a first time de shaver and this razor is great my grandfather used these types of razors and it feels wonderful to be able to enjoy shaving rather than scraping my face with a mach iii only advice is try a couple different blades depending on your skin type beard you 'll need a different type of blade one blade does n't fit all and always remember this is n't the mach iii do n't apply pressure	15
1	this razor returns one to an augustinian sense of progress and history it is similar to what my grandfather used to shave with and is simply the best way to shave so long as you have a decent brush and soap at hand	15
1	this conditioner leaves hair ultra soft and does n't weigh it down if you have trouble with conditioners leaving a strong residue on your hair this one wo n't the ingredients contain rosemary infusion lavender flower infusion seaweed and fresh lemon juice the lemon is great for washing the hair clean of residue it 's a great conditioner	15
1	i used veganese for quite awhile quite happily as there is no artificial fragrance or strong natural fragrance oils in the product it has a ho hum scent this actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market i felt veganese adequately conditioned my hair did not irritate my scalp i liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product	15
1	this is my favorite scent from philosophy it is clean and crisp never over done	15
1	i purchased this pumice stone to help remove the dried skin on my feet and ankles that appears as you get older it does a good job and comes in its own small case i use it frequently and find that i have much less dry skin in that area now	15
1	you use the peel kit by mixing a clear gel capsule with water and smear that onto your face you then put some cream on top of the gel on your face which mixes together creating a shaving cream beard after using the creams you then scrape it off using a tongue depressor look alike to shave off the foam after a quick rinse my skin looked less dull and helped clear blotches 4 stars because i ran out of the cream and still have some unused gel capsules	15
1	i really like this peel it is very easy to use and i have noticed a difference in my skin it is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading i even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing i recommend this peel to anyone i have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation i use this one about twice a week i also recommend the microdelivery vitamin c peel that one i use once a week jennife	15
1	i wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that i have are horrificly sticky and if they are n't sticky they do not stay on for long this one however manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick the color \( apple a day \) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and does n't go anywhere it also has no stickyness ! yay ! i love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs !	15
1	the first time i smelled this intoxicating scent i knew i had to have it for myself it 's heady rich very exotic dark and mysterious when i wear this perfume i envision a room filled with beautiful brown skinned women with dark black hair and richly colored silks of red and purple covering their bodies laying around on organza and brocade covered chaises eating sweet dark fruit and sipping red wine from cobalt glasses	15
1	though i have never traveled the world this perfume allowsme to feel like a veteran globe trotter it is sophisticatedwithout being obnoxious i genuinely feel like a woman ofintrigue and experience though fanciful it is fun for ahomegrown rose	15
1	caleche is an absolute classic i'm often stopped and asked what i'm wearing pretty much everything at the department stores smells the same \( like chemicals \) caleche is the real thing and the soie de parfum lasts make sure when purchasing that you do n't accidentally buy caleche eau delicate it 's a completely different frangrance guaranteed to make you gag why do marketers keep coming up with subtle twists to existing fragrances \( miracle happy pleasures poison \) \? once you try caleche you 'll no longer look for anything else i highly recommend the lotion and shower gel too	15
1	i love get fresh products especially the lemongrass lavendar scent i use the hand sugar scrub \( which is very moisturizing and gets rid of cooking odors on hands \) it is very light and pleasant as are the others i love the look better naked kit and the relief for tattered tootsies kit i am a beauty junkie and i have used much more expensive products but i never seem to like them as much as these great gift the hatbox design is very cute	15
1	ooohh sparklies ! ! ! ! ! you can put this on your face make you very much pretty turn the heads of boy types stops traffic ! !	15
1	i 've never smelled anything like this if you 've ever been to the mediterranean coast you will be instantly transported by this scent it goes on strong lasts long and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air but not the yankee candle ocean water type scent this is the real thing like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you ! rejoice all women who are tired of sugary syrupy womens' perfume ! this is it	15
1	an awesome product that sells out and that 's the only problem ! i had to call around the us to find it in a department store in stock and that would ship amazon 's supplier was sold out	15
1	proraso shave cream is the best bang for the buck in hi end non drugstore shave creams i 've tried them all and keep coming back to proraso the texture consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate and you do n't need a badger hair brush ! i initially missed using a brush at first but do n't miss all the product i wasted that were left behind in the bristles couple proraso with a good safety razor \( may i suggest merkur \) and you 'll get a shave that trounces anything a mach iii can throw at you trust me	15
1	bravo pronto pregovery nice product great shave and the eucalyptus is divine	15
1	this is a nice smell that turns babypowderish on me my fiancee luvs it he is also a huge fan of chanel no	15
1	as a dentist i am in very close physical contact with my patients this is the only fragrance i wear because it is light yet feminine and does not bother my patients i receive so many compliments every time i wear it	15
1	i typically do n't wear much cologne or perfume but this one is a winner ! my husband bought this one for me for christmas i 'd never even seen it before but he liked how it smelled what a great guy ! i could n't have been happier with this gift i love this scent clean and fresh you can wear this scent day or night not heavy or overwhelming the unique beauty of the bottle is wonderful too highly recommend beyond paradise	15
1	beyond paradise is a wonderful flirty floral scent that is n't too overpowering i recommend wearing it whenever you want to feel extra feminine	15
1	i bought this last month in purple looks awesome and it does n't hurt when you put it on best of all it stays on and if you set it it will stay all day	15
1	this lip gloss is super ! ! ! not only does it glide on your lips it has staying power the colors are so subtle and pretty it is worth every penney and i will not waste my money on cheaper sticky and short lived lip glosses	15
1	almost every time i wear curve i get comments from the ladies a very good thing i currently have 10 different types of cologne and i wear this one a lot it seems good and the scent lasts throughout the day without having to drench yourself in it	15
1	these are absolutely the best they get every hair easily the points are soo sharp these are worth the money trust me id recommend to anyon	15
1	i have an oily t zone or i should say had i started using this product because i was breaking out a lot due to the extra oil my skin was producing to keep my face moisturized not only has my face cleared up but it has a nice healthy shine to it all day no makeup necessary	15
1	this product is worth the price ! i use it every day especially my whole eye area and i love it ! it does not leave my skin feeling or looking greasy either	15
1	murad promises the miracle cure for acne while the product is good it 's not a miracle i 've been usines murad for two months and while my skin has improved it 's not flawless i still get break outs and they still take a while to heal i 'll keep using it because it 's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows maybe my skin will improve	15
1	this is my favorite soap in the world a new bar will scent my bathroom for weeks and the scent lingers on my skin as well the soap is gentle and long lasting i recommend it highly	15
1	naturally with a name like buffy i would have tried this whether i like it or not i get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it lucky for me i like ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby 's butt' \? erm no \? easy simple to use obviously no messing with jars or bottles just go to town massaging those pesky areas i'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin and cannot be persuaded otherwise	15
1	i am 40 and fell in love with this scent right away the nice thing is you do n't need to douse yourself with it to get the effect my mother who is 75 never mentions my perfume noticed it right away and kept asking me about it i just ordered her some for her birthday	15
1	this body butter is yummy it smells good it feels good on it is a must for dry skin	15
1	the smell is great the feel on the skin is great ! just like the other reviews suggest !	15
1	this is a minty fresh soap that keeps its fragrance by being topped with a black wax layer \( hence demon in the dark \) before you put this in the shower cut off the wax then enjoy the tingling soap very invigorating	15
1	i purchsed this product for my husband and he hates beauty products when we got it the minty scent was soooo strong in the box when we opened the box it was like a minty apple juice drink he used it and i was all over him and the minty smell gave him just the right energy to bring it	15
1	best face cream ever but even though cosmetic mall com had it for less the three week shipping and poor service from usps from china i 'll pay the extra buck and get it from nordstom again next time	15
1	fahrenheit by dior has a fragrance like no other i 've been fascinated by this fragrance ever since i can remember it is bold and fragrant generally people seem to either like it a lot or hate it it seems a little overpowering at first but as i said you either like it or hate it the fragrance is masculine no doubt and it 's not something that i 'd use in summer essentially a night fragrance	15
1	lancome 's juicy tubes in simmer tastes like my beverage of choice orange julius when you apply it it feels like you 're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips \( minus the cold minus the cream \) the color is a very subtle pink ish beige but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a simmer ! this is my 4th tube of juicy \( also a big fan of spring fling berry bold \) and so far this is my favorite flavor	15
1	i used to use mac 's glass lipgloss before juicy tubes were around any time the wind blew i had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which as you know is extremely unpleasant and annoying juicy tubes stays on but does n't have the overly sticky feeling which is wonderful i do n't wear much makeup and find juicy tubes to add that something special to a dewy face i recommend daiquiri or berry bold for the most natural looks daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while berry bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally you will adore this gloss i ca n't live without it	15
1	oh my gosh ! i love this lip gloss so much i first bought one last year and it was the best item of makeup i 've ever bought ! it goes great over other lip gloss lipstick or alone all of the colors are great but i 'd start our with pink first my personal favorite is spring fling because it 's not so bright but it 's still juicy you will deffinetly not regret buying one of these it 's worth every penny	15
1	this nail polish is by far the best nail product i have ever purchased ! i stumbled accross it in france two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since the brush is great depositing the polish smoothly and thinly the product dries quickly and lasts a long time it is amazing	15
1	i have been using this product religiously since i gave birth in february unfortunately i have not noticed a difference i mean no change at all	15
1	my boyfriend has this cologne and i love it ! it smells so good even if he is wearing the deodorant and not the cologne it smells as if he was it may be a little on the expensive side \( not as expensive on amazon com as macy 's or other department stores \) but it 's well worth it just be sure to correctly select the item you want because the picture shown is of the cologne	15
1	if there is a better shaving cream out there i could n't find it i 've not had any problems and a year later i'm still on my first purchase with about 40 left fantastic stuff	15
1	after hearing so many good things about philosophy 's cinnamon buns i just had to try it out for myself i found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns but more like water mixed with sugar if you use it on your head it will leave a lingering smell but it wo n't last long on your body after taking a shower i think this product is a nice way of treating yourself but i definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns which left me slightly disappointed overall a great product	15
1	i put this in a bathroom soap dispenser for christmas and it adds a nice touch during the holiday season smells nice and lathers well	15
1	i am a huge fan of the creme but not of this lip balm for the price they want this should 've been much much better it goes on nice and has a neutral taste and moisturizes ok my l'occitane lip balm or just plain shea butter does a much better job moisturizing my lips than this does save your money and do not buy this	15
1	i have been searching for years for something to keep my lips from chapping and this is it it 's absolutely amazing better than anything i have tried and i have tried so many lip products the lemon custard flavor is delicious too put it on at night and in the morning your lips will be soft and smooth this is the ultimate conditioner for your lips	15
1	i first got a whiff of blue in a magazine advertisement when it came out and it was love from that moment i went out and purchased it and this is all i wear now it is all i want to wear nothing else compares to this for me i get so many compliments ! i had one coworker once who would walk by me just so he could smell it he told me what he was doing of course he just loved the smell people want to know what i am wearing and where they can purchase it i feel great when i'm wearing it and i will keep using it as long as they will make it	15
1	this is by far the most delicious scent ever no other perfume comes even close i use it everyday and it is worth every cent	15
1	definitely a must have perfume ! the smell is just awesome not too strong not too mild and stays for long i strongly recommend this it is also a great gift	15
1	a great product for dry skin without leaving a greasy feeling not only does it make my skin feel soft but it smells wonderful	15
1	i've seen carol's daughter advertised in countless magazines i've also seen it on tyra's talk show and after hearing so many wonderful things about her company i've been dying to see how good it is for myself well today i received my carol's daughter products and i am throughly pleased ! ! ! this almond cookie fragrance smells so delicious ! ! ! i love how it feels on my skin ! ! ! finally a product that works as good as it smells ! ! !	15
1	i absolutly love all of carol 's daughter 's products everything to me is true to description i recieved my almond cookie gift set in the mail and i couldnt wait to open it the smell is to die for sometimes i open my shea souffle' just so i can smell it i also love her labels and containers i will forever be a customer of carol 's daughter and i look forward to the day where i can walk into one of her stores her prices are worth every dime remember you get what you pay for	15
1	i thank god for carol 's daughter i have finally found a quality product that makes me feel like i'm at the spa in my own home for a a resonable price i rather pay 25 00 any day for spectacular service and a fantastic product any day than 10 so so product filled with water and vaseline i am a carols daughter member so are my kids and most of my family kudos to lisa price for setting that much needed standard in the beauty industry god bless you al	15
1	this product is very well built the mirrors are clear and free from any distortion magnification level is just right the only negative about this is the light is very dim and not adjustable	15
1	the mirror was very easy to install after using the mirror a couple weeks the plane and magnifying mirrors are very clear and easy to adjust to the correct distance for great viewing the only negative is that the halo light does not provide sufficient brightness but not an issue if mirror is used in a well lighted area	15
1	was very happy with the service of delivery and i use the mirror every day	15
1	i love this product i use it when my son spits up and it either goes on his face or body sometimes it still stinks from the spit up after wiping with just a wipe so i pump a little of this on a wipe and it does the trick i have various mustela products and they all work great	15
1	this is a fabulous product i use the whole mustela line this is great for sponge bathing when your newborn arrives home i also use it on a cotton ball after baths to make sure my baby is extra clean this is great for helping babies complexion	15
1	i love this product ! i look forward to the end of the day knowing that i can soothe my tired feet with fair trade foot lotion ! i 've seen this product work wonders prior to this purchase when my husband was in the army his feet were extremley worn and torn when he came home from iraq after using this product for several days his feet looked and felt brand new	15
1	i actually got a sample from the lush store in san francisco and just tried it it 's fabulous on my cracked and peeling heels	15
1	this is my all time favorite perfume bar none ! i get millions of compliments when i wear it most people think it smells like baking cookies or marshmallows but not a little girl scent definitely a grown up girl scent men love it because it smells like food a definite turn on ! lol \) you truly cannot go wrong with this perfume it is absolutely faboo	15
1	this is a great finisher use after you 've drenched your hair with leave in conditioner and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape smells great but does n't compete with the smell of other products only con a little bit does not go a long way it 's expensive to stock up	15
1	mac lipglass is the absolute best there are plenty of colors to choose from super shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and does n't run the best colors are nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes it 's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer just pure shine	15

1	i'm really anal about scented flavored lipglosses especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla but mac lipglass is n't that vanilla ish at all ! it 's got very pigmented color it stays on a long time for a gloss and each tube lasts a long time do n't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off	15
1	i reach for ck one on days that i want a crisp fresh scent intended to be a unisex fragrance it is not at all sweet or flowery however it does have a softness to it that i personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man i find it to be slightly musky without being masculine overall this is a really nice neutral fragrance for everyday wear	15
1	ck1 is a very nice toilette spray it has a very good smell to it i gave it as a gift and now i am going to have to purchase it for me to	15
1	i love this perfume it 's the best that i have in my collection it 's not too strong but it 's enough for everyone to notice i practically wear it everyday and this size will usually last for a while	15
1	this is an amazingly fresh fragrance it 's a light lush and sparkling floral fruity blend a lot of people asked me what i was wearing i highly recommend it for someone looking for a nice scent that they can wear all day	15
1	i use both this mascara and lancome flextencils when i'm going out flextencils first then coat with hypnose my lashes look huge and not too clumpy flextencils add great length while hypnose adds volume i use hypnose by itself on just an average day great product ! makes my lashes big and not clump	15
1	i 've always used lancome mascaras before hypnose i used denfincils hypnose is a great mascara never clumps the non waterproof version is easily removable and your lashes look amazing definately give this product a try	15
1	so far this is the best thickening mascara i have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores it is not sticky or gloppy and you wo n't look like tammy fay with spider lashes i do however have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes but i have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras my journey ends here	15
1	this bath melt was nice it smelled great but it is pretty sweet it did n't do anything spectacular to the water just kind of made it look soapy the melt took it 's time melting and the smell lasted throughout the bath i took the melt after it sat in the water for a while and rubbed it directly on my skin which made my skin smell nice it also moisturizes well and makes the water feel smooth and silky but the smell did n't linger on my skin once i was out of the water	15
1	if you have n't tried lush or creamy candy do it ! creamy candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft for soap to match try rock star mmmmm ! ! ! i ca n't place the fragrance it 's cherry but not cotton candy but not it 's very sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts enjoy	15
1	this is the best micro peel i have ever tried ! the thing i noticed first was that when i applied when hope is not enough and the present they went on so smoothly they absorbed equally in my mid 30 's my young skin is fading but this really brought it back i wo n't say i am 19 again but i am sure the difference is obvious i am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since i added this to my bag of tricks it is a lot more effective that i would have thought and i have not had a microdermabrasion since i started using this 2 4 times per month	15
1	i love love this product i ca n't believe how much i actually used it i ran out of my box within two months ! all those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder this kept my straps in place all day and night ! a few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom i use the strips to close the flap in place so it 's smooth all the way down tip in some cases i cut the strips in half even half a strip holds my bra straps in place this product holds things in place or down it does not lift and hold its not ducked tape	15
1	the powder foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large pored it is one of the best around for no caking no oil smooth surface skin if you ca n't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations chanel does it best ! ! also my seller was terrific	15
1	i love this foundation it is a easy one step process i do n't like to use liquid i need something easy quick and foolproof i am always in a hurry with 3 kids i do n't have time for multi steps i also have acne and red cheeks this evens out my skin and covers my acne my skin looks flawless i have tried so many products including mac bare minerals lancome origins shiseido etc my only problem with this makeup is it is so expensive what do you expect it 's chanel pure perfection	15
1	i absolutely love this kit it keeps my dry slightly acne prone skin so soft smooth blemish free \( for the most part \) i use both everyday along with an intense moisturizer my complexion has improved greatly	15
1	i absolutely love this kit i love that i can use the great mystery every morning and it is n't harsh on my skin and i love using the greatest love at night and when i wash it off it just melts into my skin i do n't even have to put on a moisturizer for something really nice try using the great mystery and then put the greatest love on top of that it 's really amazing the only caution i would have is when using the greatest love do n't rub it in you have to massage it very lightly otherwise it will irritate your skin and can cause breakouts or make you feel like you have a sun burn	15
1	i suffered from a severe case of shingles that affected the right side of my face the infection left scars on half of my face i started using the exfoliate kit regularly after four months my face now looks normal and i'm able to go without makeup again thanks philosophy	15
1	best skin care line i have ever used frequent air travel wrecked havoc on my skin and the exfoliate kit revealed a complexion i never knew i had i'm currently using other philosophy products and have recommended them to family and friends	15
1	this is a great prodduct at a reasonable price whenever i need these i order and the arrive timel	15
1	i absolutely adore this scent ! it certainly is not just for men ! anyone who loves the smell of limes will love this ! the sea salt is amazing ! i literally have n't been able to use any other soap since discovering it two years ago and i used to be a body wash person ! never again ! give it a try ! it 'll wake you right up in the morning and keep your energy high	15
1	this is such a nice lightweight conditioner and makes my hair smell super clean and fresh	15
1	i have been using this product for years i have a really oily t zone and i find that this product keeps it in control it is a very good cleanser that removes the oil without drying your skin no matter what color your skin tone may be i think you will like this product !	15
1	product works well it 's a whole lot better than using your fingers	15
1	this product is absolutely brilliant in the past i have always had to go to the bathroom and blot with tissues and get my powder and puff out taking too long plus ending up with a cake face as the day goes on with these powder papers i can do it anytime discreetly without having to use a mirror or a puff just a fresher face with a slight dusting of powder perfect	15
1	terrific for the area around the eyes gets rid of dryness and does n't sting the eyes or feel greasy	15
1	this cream cleanser is wonderful ! i have used the clinique 3 step program since i was a teenager until i went to an at home body shop party and tried this cleanser i have been using it ever since it is so soft and creamy feels great going on my skin and leaves it feeling clean smooth and moisturized its great at gently removing make up in the evenings and is a nice pick me up first thing in the mornings	15
1	this is a very suttle fragrance that lasts for hours slightly floral however is a very intimate scent most people need to get very close to notice which can be good but also a sign that you need to spray yourself all over i would recommend picking this up if you want something to carry around in your purse to spray here and there it last for hours but is not an all day perfume	15
1	i bought this perfume about one year ago with a gift certificate i was skeptical about purchasing perfume online but i was not dissapointed this perfume is absolutely fabulous ! when you first put it on the floral freshness and ruby grapefruit awakens your senses as the top notes the middle notes included a powdery musk that is sensual yet not to woodsy and the bottom notes of jasmine are so graceful yet grasping buy this perfume you will fall in love with it	15
1	i love this perfume it has been my signature everyday scent for several years now alot of people ask what you are wearing because it smells so good and guys love it too	15
1	of all the higher end mascaras i 've tried this one is by far the best your lashes look longer and thicker with just one coat and looks like natural great lashes not made up the creamy gel formula goes on smooth never clumps or feels sticky and true to form your lashes will curl up nicely although not a water proof mascara it has incredible staying power cleans off easily i love this mascara wo n't look elsewhere	15
1	i have this product working in my hair right now it is simply wonderful ! first off it smells like lovely victorian rosebud almond pudding it has a similar consistency i can get about three to four uses from each container and i have very thick hair my hair was preciously quite dry and abused i had dyed it twice in the last six months after one use of this product my hair felt better than it had in years silky strong and shiny i love this product ! i highly recommend it	15
1	i love this product my eye brows are growing but not all over in the areas where i'm putting the product the hair has become darker but nothing extreme just in a way where i'm able to see it now \( i'm naturally a toehead \) i would recommend this to others but i'm saddened that it 's so hard to find and i was unable to do so in a store	15
1	i love this shampoo my husband bought it but i definitely use it more than he does \) anyway it smells amazing and really works well with my unruly hair	15
1	i am a fan of ralph lauren and check new products from this brand i liked this scent although i am probably more used to polo blue which is also great it is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews anyway it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for st valentine 's day	15
1	at first spray this can be a pretty potent cologne but after 1 2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it 's green original polo brother lasts all day long and into the night worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto or lighter scented cologne	15
1	this has to be by far one of the best lip treatments on the market pricy yes but well worth every cent in as few as two uses my lips have gone from cracked to whole tastes as good as it smells lemon brownsugar like the body scrub of the same name my only complaint it does n't have the longevity of say prada 's lip balm \( which i use when running \)	15
1	i love these inserts ! i had trouble finding ones this size not too big not too small they definitely help me to fill out my bras ! i would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts i tried just setting these in my bra but if i moved my arms up and my bra moved around i was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out these are a great product though	15
1	but it definitally did not work as it was intended it is intended to moisturize hair i have long fine oily hair and i received trichomania as a gift i love the smell but when i first used it it left my hair very dry which i consider a good thing considering the state of my hair it just didnt do what it was supposed to however if you have really oily hair this is the thing for you no problems with lathering either especally if you rub the bar in your hair not in your hands doesnt leave white flakes either	15
1	if you have dry hair trichomania is for you it smells like real coconuts not that synthetic crap in suntan lotions and works wonders on my dry colored and generally abused hair plus it lasts forever all of lush 's solid haircare lasts much longer than bottled stuff and contains no silicones they do take some getting used to but once you adjust everything else will smell so chemical and you 'll wonder why you ever used them	15
1	i 've tried several eye shaddow bases including laura mercier and find the laura geller eye spackle to last the longest i generally have my makeup on by 6 00am and keep in on until 9 30 pm it looks as great at night as it did in the morning i definitely recommend this product	15
1	this is the best perfume that i have ever used i tried estee lauder lancome and i always come back to paloma the scent is wonderful and it stays on your clothes for a long time buy it today	15
1	works exceptionally well clears pimple faster than other types of treatments i have used and reduces the redness very quickly my 2 teenage daughters love the product as well because such a small amount is needed a tube will last a long time will definitely buy it again !	15
1	murad acne spot treatment really works to drive away those unsightly blemishes ! it heals even the big nasty pimples in a few days with the smaller ones healing in hours it really does help to minimize the appearance of most acne after i apply it too overall i would say it is a great produce for anyone who like me considers even minor acne to be a major annoyance	15
1	i love this portable perfume it 's really sleek and easy to carry around to reapply the smell is delicious and it leaves a nice shimmery sheen on your skin	15
1	i have very fine hair and this is one products that thickens without weighing the hair down it leaves hair soft not stiff yet easy to style and keep the hold	15
1	i have this lip gloss in sweetie and will be trying other shades i am very pleased with it ! i wear it over stay on type lip colors in other brands and it keeps my color on all day \( even after eating \) ! it does n't really feel too sticky if you blot after application i only wish it tasted as good as it smells \( not that it tastes bad it 's just blah \) !	15
1	i love this lip gloss the cake batter taste smell is totally addictive the colors are lacking though all of the colors are light very sheer shades i bought the color babydoll which is a light pink it goes on sheer and i love the smooth texture too this product is supposed to have glitter in it but i didnt' notice any and or its not too glaring which makes it fine for me to wear it at work	15
1	i am a true believer in the phrase if it is not broke dont fix it its hard to improve on perfection keep up the good work until next time ! mike michalsk	15
1	these bristles have just the right combination of softness and strength however since i only use this as a back scrub brush the detachable design is not optimal for me after a few months the brush handle attachment point became compromised \( probably from all the exposure to water \) and i found that the brush would often detach from the handle as i scrubbed my back at this point many more months down the road the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all so i am looking for a \( non detachable \) replacement even so i recommend this product because of it 's great bristles and also because the handle was great while it lasted	15
1	the tounge and grove way the handle detached make it easy to use in the shower \( dont have my glasses on \) the detachable brush has medium soft bristles and will be easy on the skin the strap on the brush is cotton so this probably is n't a once in a lifetime purchase but very good for the price everybody needs one	15
1	the wipes work well they do not irritate my daughter 's face but they stink ! ! ! ! ! i usually use them before she goes to bed so that i do n't have to smell her skin as it makes me nauseous	15
1	great iron and its purple ! heats up fast stays hot variable hotness levels great i own this and the next size up and love them both	15
1	this is the only fragrance i have found that truly smells tropical this is my boyfriends favorite scent and he thinks all perfumes stink the four stars is because it takes this spray awhile to go from greasy and oily to dry you have to wait awhile before you get dressed but it smells great	15
1	this is very good soap however it 's too expensive to buy on a regular basis unless you are rich very good quality though and i would buy it again if i had some money	15
1	although this is supposed to be used as a deep conditioning treatment i used it several times a week and loved the way it made my hair look and feel only drawback is the price and the container which you have to be very careful with in the shower ! but all in all it 's a wonderful product for fine hair and i 've come back to it again and again !	15
1	i 've been using this kit for several weeks now and i am absolutely amazed at the results ! i 've had severe acne scarring due to a birth control pill i was taking they were bright red and no concealer on the market would cover them after one week of using murad i 've noticed the scars fading ! i thought nothing on this planet would fade them but murad is ! i 've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin murad drastically reduces the amount of shine i have i highly recommend this product to everyone	15
1	this product made my skin look absolutely great ! i use it twice a day and within one week i saw a huge difference i 've been now using murad for a month and the improvement is astonishing i get compliments on my skin every day i highly recommend it	15
1	i discovered the murad acne complex kit about six years ago and have been using it since it cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away some products i tried dried my skin out but murad acne complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells i recommend anyone with acne try murad acne complex to see if it will work as well for you	15
1	i love this product it takes only a few drops to make my hair shine it is light smells quite nice and is not at all overpowering or strong smelling i do n't buy cheap fragrances so i do n't know what bad perfumes reviewer nycoleb is comparing this with i suppose everyone 's body chemistry is different i have n't found any other product that does what this does so i 'll be buying another bottle when this one is done	15
1	i was amazed by the quality of this product when i first purchased it in the summer of 2006 it gives my hair a perfect sheen and softness that i have never achieved with such lightweight hair oil before and my hair has acheive lengths that i have not seen in years ! tui hair oil has a beautiful scent which does not change over the course of wearing it in your hair for a day or two or even longer if you wish	15
0	i admit i have n't finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women 's health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense is n't alternative enough for her !	18
0	i tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that i put it down in frustration it reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat the theme is interesting the execution poor cannot recommend	18
0	i have been a fan of sue henry since her first jessie arnold mystery i was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure but was very disappointed in this outing the characters were one dimensional after discovering who the bad guys were i needed to reread part of the book for clarification sue henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters they had n't a notion just how decidedly things could and would change in the next few hours even the relationship between alex and jessie seemed stilted i realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher jessie arnold but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little	18
0	i hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction if thoughts are that powerful they need to be resrained earlier i do n't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive logic can be quite painful when left alone but sometimes it has to be	18
0	i agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring it seems roth is trying to glorify philip roth and not the characters he goes on and on describing the overwhelming feelings zuckermann has for the swede without letting us know who the swede really is roth should let the characters tell the story or try to use less erudition in his narration it gets to the point where the reader loses interest in finishing the book i loved the plot against american because it was more character based than philosophizing about about the historical context of the times	18
0	let me see how many books can i write to preach to the choir about the same thing she must of got dumped by a handful of liberal boyfriends \( what intellegent person would want her \) and now she 's trying to get back at 'em ca n't wait for the next i hate liberals so much and here are my reasons why book she should join fox she would fit right in	18
0	all throughtout this book alex delaware and his police friend milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover they have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture the reader longs for the pair to actually do something in the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings that is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking i read and enjoyed several of the early alex delaware books and then quit looking for new ones now i know why	18
0	this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up	18
0	why in the world would anyone publish a writer 's bread and butter notes to his agent \? besides the money i mean there are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor whom heinlein feels did him dirty but in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master just enjoy the stories and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published	18
0	i thought it was me until i read several other reviews of predator ms cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess if she 's going to continue the scarpetta series she needs to get back on track creating characters that we care about i finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me what a disappointment	18
0	i did not finish the book \( i got about 70 of the way through before i realized i could not bear to read one more page \) maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better but i doubt it this is the first time i can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book the characters were flat and plot went nowhere please there are million of books out there spare yourself and find something else to read anything	18
0	this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature it is timely but it is not timeless not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly not one scene is memorable the true nature of the book soap opera is cloaked under its many pages messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story and she seems to have believed her publicity machine i ca n't believe that her husband who a great literary critic would not talk her out of publishing this oh i forgot money and fame trumps quality every time	18

0	you all like misogynist comics	18
0	despite early promise marked by intriguing personal observations and evident self reflection this effort fails to deliver on the author 's experience and acumen the book is a disparate set of chapters and lacks a unitary thread apart from a bitter leavening of asides on the shortcomings of united states rhetoric and policies on africa i had hoped for more given the fine record in newsprint of this well traveled journalist	18
0	i read some raving reviews about this book but i admit i was quite disappointed factual i'm sure but it lacks details and tries to touch on too much without going into any depth many other pregnancy books go into further detail	18
0	the characters are uninteresting and 2 dimensional the dialog hackneyed i have no idea why it 's on the new york times bestseller list it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else do n't waste your money	18

0	one of the blurbs i read on the book jacket compared this book to into thin air and the perfect storm no way ! those two books were edge of your seat reading experiences this account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring the action does n't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then the cliched writing and deification of balf 's subjects make this book very hard to get through unless you are a serious kayaking fan i would not recommend this book	18
0	i had somewhat forgotten how greg bear wrote his descriptions of the jart are so obscure and long winded the reader may as well just turn the page i found it annoying that greg bear attempted to invent even more words in this book than eon my largest complaint however resided in the high number of typos duplicated words letters dropped etc that made the reading even more disruptive it really looked like there had been global replacements as the same errors were repeated while i 'd admit that an author is more concerned with flow plot and technical accuracy the editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals	18
0	i was very disapointed in the book basicly the writer took bits and pieces from books written by others twisted their words and put his own spin on it it repeats itself over and over being so repetative i had to put it down there are good books out there written by people who were there i suggest you take a look at those i read many good one 's but this book wasnt in that catagory	18
0	this story is very dark full of menace and dark thoughts not great for kids ok for adults if that 's what you like a hard story not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments	18
0	this simply is n't history in real life people do things for reasons historians explain what happened and \( to some extent \) why that is how they are able to infer as yet unknown details and even predict future attitudes and acts pappe gets plenty of facts wrong but his biggest failing is to ascribe incorrect or even impossible motives to many of the people of the region this book is propaganda masquerading as history	18
0	though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology it 's the dryest most aesthetically difficult to read textbook especially if you happen to be studying the material online through independent study the publisher needs to redesign the book and or you need to have a better online course professor it feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material \( which is interesting in itself \) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction	18
0	nothing in this book was usable for me okay very little if i was trying to write the next ethan frome then this book would be perfect instead i write sci fi and fantasy i was looking for tips to improve my description of things this book recommends describing different things too much emphasis on metaphor \( which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious \) if you want to write in a way people might actually communicate this book might be a waste of your time however poets and pure literary writers might find it more useful than i did	18
0	when i found hour game in paperback at our local library 's monthly book sale i thought i had hit pay dirt but i cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as the winner and absolute power could turn out such a dog long boring and confusing i fear that mr baldacci hired an aspiring young writer to help him crank out a quick book i cannot pass this book along to my friends i could n't do that to them it will be tossed into our blue recycle bin what a waste what a shame	18
0	if you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer this book will provide lots of information it also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog but for my taste i found the photographic results to be uninspiring too much posing too much portraiture lighting not enough of just plain capturing that wonderful dog as it is	18

0	i was really looking forward to both the book and the movie unfortunately i think both are very much overrated character development is non existent we 're supposed to believe that the haunted passive timid character dave was an all star shortstop in high school \? the book had a great premise and good beginning but went nowhere interesting the handling of dave 's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book 's most intriguing character	18
0	i am a woman and was extremely offended at the portrayel of black men in this book and in the movie the work offers no balance whatsoever which feels like a slap in the face one black male in this book could have been something other than weak or cruel it is no wonder spielberg was eager to take on the project and white people are going to the theater in droves the castration of the black male has always been their main attraction apparently oprah 's as well	18

0	another parasite feeding off the leavings of much more substantial species or perhaps a more apt ocean related metaphor would be comparing malkin 's work to that of the brainless bivalves that cluster around sewer outflows or the mindless jellyfish who flow with the ocean currents but like the ocean neo cons' writings should be taken with more than a grain of salt by the way the reviewer below who wants someone named mccracken reported to amazon i'm sure you can take it instead why do n't you campaign for a zero star feature for reviews or perhaps a fact checking service for publishers of political vitriol like this work of fiction i sure hope no public money has been spent on stuff like this	18
0	i had great expectations of this book but the more i read the worse it got for a person who is supposed to be an 'orientalist' he sure does hate his subject under cover of being a scholar lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning this ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the middle east today powerful people listen to lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the muslim world unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of	18
0	i am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject there was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title i read this book because it was the subject of an on line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group	18

0	less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition this book more aptly excerpts the author 's personal conflicts with human relationships a one on one wrestling match with the self with no spectators and no judges the book is a good read for academic analysis but not so fun for venturist philosophy	18
0	i have loved many of jodi picoult 's other books but this one seemed too far fetched i did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in fact detracted from it many of my friends who are jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release	18
0	this book is a sure snooze fest luckily for me i did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class we read selected chapters of the book they writing was horrible many parts were unclear i had to reread what i read over and over i ca n't stand this style of writing barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent instead he comes off as boring and pretentious skip this book try something else	18
0	american buffalo was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic it is indeed raw but not at all fantastic the dialogue is very choppy and i felt out of the loop with it as if i missed some great detail perhaps this is a play that needs to be enjoyed when seen performed rather than just read i do not recommend	18
0	maybe it was me but i kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and i had to put it down it was almost aggravating	18
0	though the concept of sharing real life problems experienced during pregnancy is a great one the author is extremely biased toward hospital birth managed by obs at one point the author actually defends episiotomies she seems to blindly accept every procedure her physician pushes upon her and she looks at him as being responcible for the outcome of her birth it was both infuriating and saddening if you are looking for a book to make you laugh a little this is cute if you are looking for a book that might actually aid or assist you in making informed choices concerning your pregnancy or birth this is not for you !	18
0	while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book it reminds me of the story the emperor has no clothes yes choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying the flipping back and forth was not accomplished in a smooth flowing manner in addition the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone	18

0	i looked for an introduction to the basics of office automation and bought this book every example code i tried was incorrect and the examples are just all trivial samples from the msdn was just as good as this book if you only need a rough overview what technologies are out there this book is ok but for any real programming it is not very useful	18

0	obviously from all the reviews this book appeals to many people i am not one of them perhaps it 's because i do n't care for science fiction i found the writing stilted the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them the story boring and the ending \( covered in the introduction \) to be a twilight zone cliche if like me you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed	18

0	i love danielle steel ! i`ve read all of her books so far but secrets was a big disappointment to me as far as i am concerned ms steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins \( some explicit parts i didn`t like at all \) simply not the danielle steel we like the story itselfs is ok \( gives the readers some insights behind the scenes of hollywood \) but some of her books i`ve read over and over again i am not going to touch secrets for a second time however	18
0	clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is an endorsement of ethnic cleansing if the tables were turned and a jew or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s t i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth ! !	18
0	mcmurry 's text is a very friendly gentle intro to organic it 's a thoroughly enjoyable read but it does n't teach you what you need to know explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief and the problems included are usually very basic and general \( the spectroscopy and synthesis problems in particular \) if you 're looking to become a chemist this is not the book to learn from i 'd recommend vollhardt and schore 's textbook or any number of sophomore level texts that will give you the skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully \( i e on exams or out in the industry \)	18
0	i was hoping that miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a classical epic what we get is a blood splattered 300 lacedaimons in the hood the spartans are presented to be a buch of homo erotic rastafarians the persians rather than the noble middle eastern autocrats presented in their art are drawn by miller to resemble african american gangstas with piercings and skin art everywhere i was looking for xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot if you were into sin city you will love this mishmashed version of the classical tale of bravery and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds	18
0	this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is \( there is n't a single clue at any point in time \) the heroine keeps loosing her memory so you do n't even have the usual good characterizations of hero heroine \( since she ca n't even remember much about herself much less him \) if you like kay go ahead and read it but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard	18
0	the content is excellent the digital format is largely useless i bought the digital 5th edition to supplement my paper 4th edition but the digital rights management restrictions mean that i ca n't print selected pages to stick in a folder read on the train or scribble notes on i ca n't even cut and paste particularly relevant bits into an electronic 'notes' file the onerous digital restrictions are not suitable for an academic book like this one	18
0	i purchased this book based on the mostly glowing reviews from other reviewers and i am very disappointed the arabic fonts used are so small that at times it is actually quite difficult to make out the letters definitely not a book for people who are new to the language	18
0	i bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me however the information provided is too extensive and confusing listing far too many points in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them the body map listing them is in the first part of the book so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to i also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous the way this system originated is also a little murky this is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public	18
0	horrible book the racist continues his trend of substandard writing	18

0	i found stale recounting of very well known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics with no insights since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface i was n't expecting historical depth but i was expecting at least one fresh idea i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg \( about technology in the economy of the 19th century \) i was disappointed i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower college freshmen born in the 1980s i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy	18
0	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18
0	surely i'm not the only one who found this book totally bad the only thing it made me wonder about is how it 's possible to write such a thorougly boring book about such fascinating women the writing is just dull and full of the author 's biases and prejudices which just are n't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves it 's written in that old school feminism \( negative no fun \) tone that thank god feminism has since moved beyond my advice find another book about women mystics not filtered through flinder 's lens	18
0	sorry this guy 's voice gave me the creeps he sounds like a preacher who can meditate without the ability to respond positively to the leading voice	18

0	there 's a ton of paper in this book overboard in my opinion wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious i 've taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information has n't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california	18
0	at least this author mentions the mockery strategy martha mdiddy tried to use to fog the public the real issue of whether martha mdiddy committed the crimes and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question did martha stewart lie demonstrates some complacency is it this complacency martha mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote \? is it the greyness of white collar crime that martha mdiddy was trying to play on \? is society the ultimate judge about a person 's guilt or innocence \? if so what has martha mdiddy been judged \? be thoughtful shaw	18
0	is the main goal of every male evo psy writer to attack feminism \? here 's an experiment for you juxtapose the ideas in this book and say pinker 's blank slate with those of i do n't know any two female evo psi writers and watch the incongruities jump off the pages it 's f ing comical but guess what \? the females' books are way better thought out and accurate while the males' are a lot of wishful thinking hmmm aging successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging successful males are made for each other that men are wired to treat sexually liberated women like s and to fawn over repressed chastity obsessed airheads whatever	18
0	i love heinlein i think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction i find that his plots and ideas are inventive even this story was inventive in many ways like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters however i found this book as a whole to be very boring much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters the quot main quot characters of each section of the book are n't fully realized at all i would n't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really really bored	18
0	i tried reading it and made it about 3 4 pages i'm pretty sure that 's a bad sign i seem to recall mr sedaris writing about his mother 's bedpan or something the impression i instantly got was beep beep ! pretentious young writer peddling so called bad childhood experiences for fame money and sympathy guess what mr sedaris \? i do n't give a \( expletive deleted \) about your so called bad childhood millions of people have bad childhoods and do n't play the sympathy card check out augusten burrough 's books they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style	18
0	i 'll reread any of lipman 's books multiple times except this one boring and disappointing finish	18
0	i'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing i kept thinking maybe it 's me maybe there 's something wrong with my attention span that i lose interest in these stories half way thru they all seem too long unfocussed what they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories the quality puzzles me because i'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf i read in the zines i have n't followed this anthology over the years but this particular edition imho shows bad selection and worse editing	18
0	for the most part these people whom the author thought are prominent jews are either ignoramuses as regards to judaism and our heritage \( especially the 2 supreme court justices who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek \) or are not even jewish at all a waste of time	18
0	being a second generation member of this so called cult and having parents that went through the same situation as the author i can say that he must have too weak to fulfill his duty to god and true parents it 's very sad when a member must leave by sacrifcing you are able to develop a stronger relationship with god hope this helps	18
0	i did not find this book very helpful there is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to quot invest quot in \( it seems the pricier the better and i mean several hundred dollars i actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands \) and what kind of fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals i am not a professional chef just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple good tasting meals for my family the recipes here seem to be time consuming and complicated not much money to be saved here	18
0	this is not a book i would recomend for anyone serious interested in rune casting it tells nothing of the history of runes and it seems if the writer figured out what tarot card closely matches each rune and then wrote the book based off that info there are much better books out there for rune casting	18
0	this has to be one of the worst written books i ever read i ca n't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing so far danielle steel has found a way in the first third of this book i just ca n't read the rest of it generally if a book is n't very good i can suffer through this one has gotten on my last nerve i had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable but i do n't think i will be reading anymore of her books it 's an insult to nora roberts and sandra brown for her to be ranked with them	18
0	i love dogs but if i had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training including the different levels snd sub levels i would have bought a manual i wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing i got neither the characters were neither likeable nor substantive except for the cop next door i have no idea what they even look like or what if anything they care about besides dogs the plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear maybe the series inmproves after this book i'm not taking that chance	18
0	temperance brennan is an american forensic anthropologist the author is a anthropologist in real life and i feel she gave to much detail as to body parts conditions locations in the book and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about gabby including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of gabbys place how gabby and tempe were friends from grad to man parts in life book was not for me i dropped it at the 3rd chapter	18

0	will somebody please tell me what the appeal is \? yes i know it 's a classic but it 's a really really boring classic the prequel to charlotte bronte 's jane eyre is the story of bertha mason 's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why bertha went nuts it 's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they did n't like little french girls in jamaica racism sexism and classism drove bertha `round the bend there i 've saved you the trouble of reading it now re read jane eyre instead	18
0	i have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more the language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words these books can cause you embaesment since i read where ever i have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it please we would all like to see more of these	18
0	this book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook \( certainly by european standards \) but the physical packaging is a total disaster it has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins it is difficult to read text near the spine and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page the most unuseable book i 've ever experienced	18

0	this was required reading for my british literature class it 's the only novel in the class that i struggled with and only struggled from boredom it is entirely possible that i just do not understand the genius that is forster but i did not enjoy this novel a lover of forster or modernist writing might enjoy it more it must be a classic for a reason	18
0	this book is very disappointing as is most of gunaratna 's work on islamist terrorism it 's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear ie bin laden and aq are everywhere responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups \( such as ji \) are aq franchises total bollocks the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a scholar who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary	18
0	i could n't read the whole thing in order to know for sure it was dry i did n't get the imagery i know it 's supposed to be a classic and i really wanted to read the book i did but it was long and boring and i just do n't get why it 's so classicly popular sorry but it 's how i feel now that being said i read a condensed version of it and i discovered the story was a little bit interesting but that 's as far as i can go even with the condensed version it was only a little bit interesting	18
0	this book was very helpul in learning about how to handle my dog	18
0	this book is pure fiction nothing more the problem is that is presented as fact albeit little known fact i wo n't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers except to say that i also concur with the criticisms of the book it makes for difficult reading it really is not worth the effort as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end in fact if you are a historian or scholar stay away from it	18
0	flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn 's political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn 's politicians \( the majority of whom are democrats \) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i'm still looking	18
0	a good friend of mine insisted i 'd read this book because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life in the end i was very disappointed not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book but michael crichton 's whole attitude he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences only to revert back to his arrogant narrow minded attitude once again for the next chapter how can anyone claim they 've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in \? sadly this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth i have no desire to read any more of his books	18
0	it was amazing when i read this how self centered and morally wrong this man was it makes me sick to my stumach to read it this was nothing more then glorifing his looting and murdering in cold blood if you have a chance skip this one and read somthing like company commander or band of brothers somthing worth while	18
0	i know that no book can cover every topic but this book left a lot out it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness which is much more common and some of the information was just plain wrong i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because i could n't feel the baby move it advised that i should call the doctor when i did i found out most women do n't feel it move until 21 weeks unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong i would not suggest this book to anyone	18
0	the only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle the rest is just quotations from other books there is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half the author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said i read it to the end though probably because the author has a very nice writing style he is probably a good playwrite though i have never read any of his plays he just did n't have enough material for a book here i'm surpised it got published	18
0	i 've read great reviews about this book so i finally bought it because i could not get it at my local library never ever finished the book it was god awful badly written incoherent story it jumped around just plain bad	18
0	i could n't read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter your wives are your fields so go to your fields as you like is n't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i'm not going to finish this book because i 'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic oppressed other type of woman thanks	18

0	should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a business decision \? i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this criminal spectacle designed to make the question of martha mdiddy 's innocence a moot point are honest business practices being pushed to the side \? by normalizing generalizing and minimalizing martha mdiddy 's crimes are we loosing our morality \? how important is integrity to a leader former ceo of a company \? be thoughtful	18

0	i must say i enjoyed the book but the ending was so sudden with so many things left hanging that i was disappointed i wish one more chapter had been written to clear up how did manderly catch fire what did they do when they got to the burning house and how did they pick up their lives all we had at the ending was ashes also the narrator who never gives her name was sometimes very odd hiding behind doors in her own home sneaking food hiding behind chairs the book is worth reading but i wish that instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea du maurier had written a better ending	18
0	i agree with a number of previous reviewers grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between quot wicca quot and quot witchcraft quot wicca is not an old religion indeed it is not much of a religion at all it has always lacked definite theology \( what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you 'll get four answers \) and grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non scholarly lights in fact the book is poor on all accounts from confused terminology to quot chopping quot of source materials this is a waste of money	18
0	the writing was very disjointed in my opinion i had to read and re read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say it was a struggle to read no likeable characters i made it to the part where it was introduced that madeline slept with the ex husband and current wife give me a break ! i moved on immediately too many good books waiting for me to waste time on this absurd tale	18
0	the book is fine except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer she 's such a boring character she 's young but not motivated to work in fact she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men and get support the point is that she does n't enjoy the job thus a detailed description of her dog training job \( which she does n't seem to enjoy \) was just a boring digression	18

0	well you know the rest aside from her brash repetative demeanor her cooking has a lot to be desired these meals cannot be done in 30 minutes unless that is if you want everything half cooked the book makes false promises and does not deliver there are also no pictures and no index and the recipes are very confusing most of them deriving from an original master recipe and then just changing one or two things if you want good food and a good cook book do n't buy into the hype and do n't buy this book	18
0	very seldom do i give up on a book i gave up on this one after several attempts to finish i have read barbara delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books i remember the fascination with the peyton place grace metalious hoopla in the 50 's and 60 's so i was expecting to enjoy this story it is dull and tiresome	18
0	no one alive today cares that ny had fires in 1741 \( unlike the chicago fire of 1871 \) why did author lepore choose to bring up this terrible racial incident is she trying to create trouble \? be a traitor to her own race \? book is well researched i guessbut the racial subject matter stinks and was unnecessary to bring up ! totally unnecessary !	18
0	i found the book had some ideas that helped but it was unrealistic in many ways i am spiritual but i did n't appreciate the religious opinion it gave	18
0	american pastoral was repetitious to the nth degree i read the human stain a few years ago and it was good but in pastoral the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the swede and a psychoanalyst and between his daughter merry and a psychoanalyst but absent the psychoanalyst roth is our psychoanalyst what he misses however is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control the swede never failed as a father rather he failed because he could n't let go of his sense of responsibility for her	18
0	same ole same ole just another way for her to make a buck shame	18
0	i'm a fan of dave barry i enjoy his column i enjoyed some of his books in the past and i bought this one with great anticipation boy was i disappointed ! the story is meaningless the characters are not interesting the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny do yourself a favor do not read this book ! i ca n't believe anyone recommends it	18
0	after anticipating the arrival of this book \( that i ordered some time before publication after hearing of it \) i was disappointed although the subject is timely the writing style smacks of academia and therefore will not appeal to the mainstream \( reader \) because i'm tenacious by nature i finished the book but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention too bad it could have been inspirational	18
0	i am a big catherine coulter fan but this book is awful you can skip all the soap scenes a waste of space much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat do n't waste the 6 borrow from the library if you want to read	18
0	why use 1 word when 12 will bewilder the reader and make the book that much thicker i can not believe that a qualified editor reviewed this book the wheat to chaff ratio is horrendous you can go whole paragraphs without coming upon anything worth knowing i can only hope that the actual cisa exam questions are not written as poorly as the sample questions within this book if you value your time do not buy this book	18
0	the problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well the author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation why could the equation not be solved \? there is a reason for this fact and the mathematical theory explains it well but not this book perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general the reason is the subject of galois theory taught in high level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book but apparently not in this one	18
0	i bought bead fantasies and bead fantasies ii at the same time after reading the positive reviews i wish i had looked at these books before buying there are pretty motifs that i will incorporate into my beading projects but i find the small typed directions overly simplistic and the diagrams are too small i'm glad this is n't my first beading book or i would feel totally discouraged from trying any of these projects i wo n't be buying bead fantasies iii the art and elegance of beadweaving and coraling technique remain my favorite beading books	18
0	i love other preston childs books so i thought i would love this one i did n't it is completely predictable i was sure that the author would give it some interesting plot twists but there were none and parts of it were ridiculous the length of the entombment the amount of the treasure the manner of transport etc the only character i really liked was the monkey	18
0	col mike martin raised in iraq speaks fluent arabic the taliban are pashtoon they are not arabs they do n't speak arabic they do n't even like arabs very much they are a totaly closed tribal society i spent a year living and working with the pashtoon in 2005 in helmand province there are no members of the taliban who are not pashtoon the other ethnic groups in afghanistan the tajik and the hazara are opposed to the taliban mike martin would not have the correct family clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off sorry but forsythe has dropped the ball on this one	18
0	while it 's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination deconstructionism by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is of course inhabited by people who read and people who write this is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical it rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone	18
0	the author had a great idea but he cherry picked the available info about superman and the writers to get the book to make sense for example superman was originally written as a metaphor for jews during ww2 two jewish guys right at the end of ww2 write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b c it 's destroyed etc etc i'm not critiscizing this book b c it has a religious message i'm critiscizing it b c the author clearly left out clear facts that work against his arguement otherwise i disagree with anybody that says it is just a comic superman has often reflected the current values and attitudes of a large swath of america	18
0	if you have kids or grandkids who think about politics like sf give them this book ! it was one of the many heinlein works that helped me grow up it is the best most important of his for kids novels i ment to give it 5 stars ! ! ! !	18
0	i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one sided book i 've ever read it was n't about the crimes it was about this author 's personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos he has a real problem with women lesbians in particular he made ms wuornos out to be someone she was n't she had a hard life yes and chose to committ crimes but that was n't what this book was about again it was n't worth the i actually threw my copy of this away	18
0	i found this book to be very disappointing ms conant and her heroine were both suffering from memory loss with this book not up to her usual standard	18
0	the plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is \? we know where the precious document is another useless quest people are murdered by the half dozen the characters are outrageous most of the time improbable and i felt the semi erotic swimming episode totally stupid not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it i have read much better books than that sorry	18
0	thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we 're reading a story we like to look for clues in what we 've read to help us unravel the plot and find out who did it and why the crime was done john grisham cheats us out of that fun the villian of this book is n't introduced until there less than 75 pages left which means that when you get that far you realize that everything you read before then was n't valid to have some red herrings in a thriller is fine but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings \? that 's bad read another thriller instead of this one one that plays by the rules	18
0	this is one of the dullest chick lit derivatives of the ya ya sisterhood and their adventures or misadventures it is full of misery poorly developed characters and is so formulaic that i predicted the outcome after about 50 pages at which point i could no longer stomach these ego driven falsely sweet dolts do n't waste your money	18
0	i bought this book because i was looking for some alternatives to pb j both of my children are now attending peanut free tree nut free schools this book has lots of ideas but too many of them are variations of the peanut butter sandwich	18
0	grisham 's worst book by far 90 of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys it would be ok if that was woven into a good story but it is not for great grisham read the firm and the partner for very good read runaway jury and pelican brief all of these are page turners street lawyer is a stomache turner really bad what happened	18
0	i have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly there are a lot of good books out there dan harrington 's the very best but this isnt one of them too much ego here and not enough helpful information	18
0	i was so disappointed in this book i do n't find a closeness to god in the pages instead it seems intellectual it contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with god face to face even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal god i seek and though the author 's prayers are included too i feel the same about them i expected more from richard j foster	18
0	book contains many useful lists charts comparisons to define giftedness many helpful hints about raising a gifted child main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general and may push those with quot normal quot kids into thinking they have gifted ones and down that track when they should not gifted kids are the exception not the norm as this book makes it seem	18
0	i was expecting new and interesting ideas from this book but was disappointed if you truly have no idea how to find a sales baseline for your business or do n't know how to track trends this book is for you if you are like me \( you know the basics but were trying to find a more thorough approach \) i would n't buy the book	18
0	you can breeze through this book in under an hour i just did while it makes for a suspenseful albeit entertaining account of what happened that infamous night damore relies too heavily on witnesses' accounts and police remarks \( often little more than kennedy bashing \) by now most of us can accept the facts that emk drank way too much and drove off a bridge subsequently leading to tragedy dui accidents happen every day chillingly often to average people the fact that this happened to one of the greatest senators in the history of the united states only reaffirms this	18
0	it 's a long read the characters are boring and the ending makes no sense at all it is neither funny nor thrilling it 's just plain dull	18
0	i had to read this book as part of a masters level class on organizational management i would offer it up for sale but i intend to burn it when class is over unless you want to read a book written by people who are so much better than you are \( he said with an extra helping of sarcasm \) do yourself a favor and skip this book it a bunch of religous self righteous fairy tale dogma horrible horrible book will look nice when it 's burnt to a crisp however	18
0	i was not impressed with this book it 's worth reading only because there are so few ruby on rails books there is too much basic ruby and not enough rails in this book i much prefered the agile web dev with rails	18
0	i really thought i would be able to learn about the philadelphia project from this book considering the title however the actual project does n't make an appearence until the last chapter the entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place this book was disappoiting to an extreme	18
0	this novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries in between the entertainment biz cliches the author can only think to put various assination hits some of the characters are interesting but not believable and they certainly ca n't make up for the braindead plot read some of his other novels and skip this one	18
0	this book is outdated for the 21st century the basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today	18
0	i might have been expecting too much but i was disappointed with this book i did not learn anything on dark magick per se the first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like goths vampires lost souls the collective unconscious dark deities satanism and some other stuff the second half is about magick but it sounds more like high magick to me where 's the dark magick	18
0	this book disappointed me after reading martins letters although this book provides a very different angle on value investing and has some useful ideas the writing style is poor and lacks clarity there are much better books on analysing companies i suggest financial statement analysis by martin fridson and fernando alvarez	18
0	i thought this book was supposed to help you construct a very useful and pretty small house on a budget i was wrong instead it is about not too big houses where you spend tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands on all kinds of architectural extravagances perhaps this book could have a subtitle how to spend a million dollars on a 1 500 square foot house if you are looking to build a house efficiently and cheaply this is the wrong book	18
0	i see where this would be appealing to sum i just never got it oh well	18
0	i must say i was dissapointed with those 2 stories first story is so far from reality \( i know i know sometimes we want to get away but not that far ! ! ! \) i could n't read even half of the 2nd story it was written very poorly sometimes i felt like something just was n't enough at times opposite like it was way too much ! anyway i would n't recomend bying this book	18
0	this is j a jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations does n't help	18
0	the content of this book is adequate but the layout leaves much to be desired the only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents pages are not labeled with chapter information such as which chapter that page belongs to the content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half this makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book you can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused if the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book i would rate it much higher	18
0	very disappointing as well as boring ! ! generalities of little help have seen simple cheap books with better ideas and tips the writer might be a grandmaster but this will not help othercreatures forget about this book	18
0	i'm a big nora fan but i could n't even finish this one by the fourth chapter i began to skim way way way to much detail for me which made it boring and slow testing and corrosion is it fake is it real blah blah blah enough ! i did however enjoy the side story about the brother \( i forget his name \) but thats it folks unlike all the other reviewers i hated it i say pass on this one but as you can see i'm in the minority	18
0	this book is out of rint for one reason it is terrible i am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says she blames p amp g for the destruction of the environment mistreating employees the role of women in society and racism p amp g has done many things wrong most big companies have but it is not the cause of the fall of western society	18
0	the author keeps referring to the lds church as a cult by definition a cult is a religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian charismatic leader in christ 's day many would have considered his movement \( christianity \) a cult by definition and now it 's the largest religious form of worship in the world so let mormons do their thing there 's upwards of 12 000 000 of them now so i guess they 're not a cult anymore	18
0	i am an avid reader and could not make it through this book his other books were so good i could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be in applying some of the recommended techniques my 11 year old daughter emily thought i lost my mind thank goodness things are back to normal we are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice	18
0	as a student of urban development and politics i can confidently say that this book is a forgettable work of a parochial mind davis offers a hardline marxist view of los angeles that by employing simply economic analysis does not allow for the intricacies of the city 's problems class warfare plays a much smaller role in the sprawl of los angeles anyone outside of the iso should be discouraged from reading this baseless drivel	18
0	i had to buy this book for a class it is an extremely boring read and i struggle to keep myself awake while reading it \( as does the rest of the class i am told \) it does tell you about dreamweaver though and i suppose that is its purpose one thing that i do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing internet explorer and other isp 's his personal opinions are a real turn off and unnecessary	18
0	i lived in france i know plenty of fat french women and french women who drink hard liquor every day and french women who drink coffee more than just in the morning french women do n't have the market on thinness by any means people all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits the author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on and her dropping of french phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying nothing new in this book eat less exercise more	18
0	definitely not one of his best ! slow slow slow but at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language unlike the hero of the partner who learned a little known spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks	18
0	f this self help industry crap quasi astrological poppycock at its worst i can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title humans are far more complex than the hack man warrior female maiden title what 's his name gives them and remember this doctor is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives so why do you \? let 's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self help industry to the torch that 's a great start to a sane life	18
0	clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is an endorsement of ethnic cleansing if the tables were turned and a jew or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s t i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth ! !	18
0	we have to use this book for the college class that i'm taking and it is a horrible book i often find myself looking for help on the internet rather than going to this book it is poorly organized i have to go to the index in order to find something i specifically need because the book is n't in any order i would n't recommend this book to anyone find another there are many more	18

0	i have read several of hiaasen 's books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did	18
0	pretentious and boring too clever for its own good the only good chapters in this book are the ones about pontius pilate and jesus christ and there 's not enough of that and this was the michael glenny translation	18
0	just to make the plot work not very realistic if you want a realist cop character try michael connelly 's harry bosch	18
0	i agree with some of the negative reviews that the junie b jones books often use language and depict behavior that are less than desirable my son who is a pretty sensitive boy did n't like junie b jones because he thought she was rude i would much prefer that my kids read books with kids who though they may get in trouble from time to time or may make mistakes are generally nice people we did love the magic tree house series both for the adventure and the personalities of jack and annie	18
0	i enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts but i did n't even make it through the first chapter before i put this book down in disgust almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments as i was flipping through the book i found x rated pictures and drawings that i would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book i never would have bought this book if i had seen it in a bookstore and i regret throwing it in the trash before i could see if i could get my money back	18
0	as a lecturer of e commerce i was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the internet however i am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored the author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the internet has brought about the result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic i have nothing good to say about this book money wasted	18
0	as many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction however midway it turns into a romance novel i give it 3 stars for holding my attention a good beach read that can get you thinking \( a little \) about a time past the one star is a mistake and i cannot seem to change it 3 stars	18
0	i bought this for a quick trip based on the good reviews and the fact that the new fodor 's is n't out yet this has a lot of beautiful pictures and good background explanations but is n't great if you actually want to see much beyond holy sites and ruins the maps are not comprehensive enough \( the one for modern jerusalem did n't cover a third of the city and the one for tel aviv was tiny \) and there is not enough practical information about food hotels and getting from place to place i was disappointed	18
0	i tried as hard as i could but just could not get into this book not quite as bad as her book impossible but close danielle steel is getting so repetitive in her writing basically this book repeated over and over how much quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he did n't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying dead drivel she could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves but no a waste of time very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all disappointing to say the least	18
0	i 've heard this book on tape which poor writing aside is more horrifying to actually hear o'reilly read in his own voice the gratuitous sex \( which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels \) is enough to turn anyone off but that voice narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure a sad sad example of narcissism at it 's very worst	18
0	this book was written in 1982 updated in 1995 it has a whole section on cameras which is n't useful since most of them are outdated does n't even mention digital cameras since it specifically discusses the mechanics of cameras i found this book to be disappointing	18
0	this book was very boring details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating this book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it a poll was taken and about 73 of the students in the school liked this book what does that show about the book \?	18
0	i have been slogging through this book for weeks now it was a terrible shock to the system after john julius norwich 's excellent book on byzantium the book lacks any narrative thrust often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another the one consistent thing throughout this book is the author 's obvious agenda to set the record straight and prove that the ottoman empire was far superior to its barbaric european contemporaries	18
0	cruel horrible story with a typical barr convoluted plot the abuse of children evil ranger poising as a dead ranger freaky religious sect dead animals on the bed and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me i 've read many barr books and my biggest complaint up until now has been that sometimes there are so many characters it 's hard to keep them straight in this book that was the last of my worries i did n't even finish it i was so turned off	18
0	it starts out like laura bush 's rules for driving but skydives after the opening pages in which the then 17 year old laura kills a young man with her car who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend ! my interest in the book sharply dove after that as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about laura bush	18
0	i purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children i liked the story but the chapters were way too long my children kept asking how many more pages \?	18
0	i picked up the audio book from the library and did n't know by the title and author 's name \( my first jance book \) that this was chick lit i do n't feel this book was something i would 've started had i known it started real well and ms jance knows how to reel you in with her writing midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor and then about her friend who died of als and then came the long responses to the blogs it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could 've been a decent suspense drama	18
0	this year 60 of college entries will be female look at this spring 's honor role listings last year 78 of honor role members in my community were female schools are fails boys not girls if you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap then get this book if you want to really improve the quality of education there are thousands of reads better than this	18
0	ms howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one it 's ok to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one so disappointing especially after her wonderful hilarious to die for the trees \( for paper \) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time	18
0	i hate this book it is extremely boring and it is way too long there are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar do not read this unless forced to i like to read but this nearly put me to sleep avoid at all cost	18
0	we absolutely loved cloudy with a chance of meatballs \( i highly recommend it \) but this is nowhere near as good most of the story is just rehashing the original book with a little politically correct let 's ship the extra food to the hungry thrown in lame	18
0	i had high hopes for this book there are too many parts that feel self serving and pointless i felt like i was reading the author 's autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation the material on ideo could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader i found the preface by one of the author 's former professors to be the best part of the book i would not recommend buying this book	18
0	this book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter paranormal investigator provides good case histories as well as ghost stories that can be used as examples on investigations	18
0	i thought that she was going to explain to you how to invest in rental properties without going into deep debt for yourself however the truth is you need money to invest in real estate so there 's really no way around it which made her book redundant she just gave examples of 3 people with 3 different investment strategies in the end the one with the most number of rental properties ended up with the largest profit growth i really did not find the book useful for someone looking to invest in rental properties	18
0	if you 've read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his quot official religious disclaimer quot at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author 's own religious dogma if you share the author 's religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	18
0	the stationery is cute and colorful but the pages are very cluttered while the envelopes have spaces to write addresses and put return labels the pages are too colorful and bold a ballpoint or ink pen does n't look good on the paper	18
0	this is without question the worst book ever written on one 's financial life to begin with it 's useless zero information zero new analysis of old information zero advice zero interesting anecdotes additionally it 's rambling meandering from summaries of old data to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel good blathering what exactly is this guy 's point \? no way to tell seriously this book is so bad that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have in my opinion lost all remaining credibility what a waste of my 16 and 4 hours i want my money and time back	18
0	i have the first edition of this book and had problems with recipes some i knew were wrong and could figure them out i heard from the publisher and there were more than 20 mistakes which were fixed in subsequent printings so if you are buying this do not get the first edition ! !	18
0	watson and crick pilfered the data of rosalind franklin \( unbeknownst to her \) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double helix nature of dna instead of acknowledging her with praise watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working \( ie a woman working in male dominated science n the 1950 's \) a classic case of reaction formation maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships	18
0	there were too many characters disjointed plot threads not much of a plot in the first place and not much coverage of the overall march itself it focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who were n't that compelling	18
0	the title of this book should be photoshop finishing borders dave devotes too much time and effort giving tips on framing and giving borders to your images there are a few other tips i was happy to see however i have to give this one a definite thumbs down i still love you dave \( i want my money back !	18

0	am i the only one who did n't get a complete book \? at first i noticed there was some poor editing lots of typos but then after page 180 where page 181 should be \( sleep chapter \) it goes back to page 117 \( discipline chapter that i already read \) it continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 \( a whole 63 pages duplicated ! \) then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the school days chapter that i do n't have the beginning of i'm completely missing pages 181 245 \( 67 pages \) other than that good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas	18

0	very poor book realy a waste of time the review below said it all	18
0	the book is obviously well researched and the chapter on the riders was interesting however the author included a lot of details that just really did n't matter as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts the photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book my professor was able to bring dr schrag to talk to our class he was a good lecturer keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the metro if he could make his writing style more like his teaching style i think he would have much more success as an author	18
0	ed klein is really so desperate in his attack that he ca n't find any one person who will use their names in the attacks against hillary ! what a lot of misinformation and outright lies to actually accuse marian wright edelman of using children for her own ends is short of criminal and to insinuate that chelsea was the result of a rape even though on the next page he discusses their fertility search to become pregnant is disgusting i should have known what to expect when the first two words in the book were monica lewinsky !	18
0	the topic of this book is very interesting espionage in the revolutionary war unfortunately washington 's spies goes into so much nit picking detail that as the cliche goes you ca n't see the forest for the trees to really get anything out of this book you 'd have to be a very dedicated revolutionary war buff it did n't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader	18
0	you get your money 's worth here there are a ton of cds in this audio book unfortunately i found bryson 's prose \( which i enjoyed a lot when reading silently as i have done with his other books \) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud to me he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts and sometimes there is a sort of moist sound when he pronounces words hard to describe until you hear the cd but trust me on this one i think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book and not the cd i would stick with the written word on this one	18
0	this is another piece of lowbrow anti german propaganda dressed as historiography the book is a mess of primary yet selective and biased historical research simplistic psycho babble ridiculous sociological anthropological speculation pathetic organization behavioural theorising and last but not least absolutely third rate military history the author is hell bent on proving that there is a german sonderweg from the founding of the second reich to hitler that the vaunted german army is nothing but foolish automatons predisposed to atrocities and mindless offensives all in all cheap trash billed as history	18
0	a book full of heartwarming stories from country stars singers writers and listeners or so the back of the book said as i read some sentimental stories and some down right boring stories i questioned how more than half of these stories got into the `country1 edition of the chicken soup series i loved about three stories liked about ten and was puzzled by all the other entries	18
0	i have a hard time believing that the author has ever seen an episode of tng i had to force myself to finish this book it was so bad by far the worst star trek book i have ever read if you want a good one read 'federation' and stay as far away from this one as you can	18
0	i was so upset after i finished reading this book i wish it was n't updated and they just kept it in its original version if you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values this is the wrong book read bushido the soul of japan the code of the samurai really felt like the code of the japanese business man	18
0	i 'll be blunt i did n't care for this book i bought it thinking it would delve into the subject of the gnostic sophia instead the author goes this way and that and hardly even mentions her i really think the title was misleading as a sidenote lucifer is given a bad rap in this book and many concede that lucifer plays an important part in later understandings of gnosis	18
0	this book bears litthe relevance to the 'original' fourth edition book of the same name there is no coordination with the text most of the concepts are explained in terms of economics not computer science i have to wonder if the whole idea is a gross mistake or a scam i feel cheated	18
0	this book was fun to look at but not really usable lots of stylized drawings and self aggrandizing tales by the author and not a lot of realistic how to also the explanations about skin care were clearly not written by anyone with a science or medical background	18
0	in the chapter about south asia the authors have written quite a lot about the quot kashmir problem quot but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350 000 kashmiri hindus that took place in 1990 i just cannot believe that they do n't know about this	18
0	i was hoping the book would be good most reviews are however the topics are not really covered at all more introduced it was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing they openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english just as well long rambling thaughts that do n't form conclusions not what i wanted or needed it actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go	18
0	i enjoy reading sports fiction with my 10 year old son the descriptions of this book suggested it addressed important themes which transcended basketball however as i read the book i found the treatment of those themes quite superficial in addition the book was bawdy while it may accurately reflect locker room mentality many readers may not find that mentality entertaining it is not an appropriate book for children	18
0	i do n't really understand all the reviews about sun tzu 's work people saying that this one or that one is closer to the original are there really that many experts in ancient chinese out there how can anyone say which is the best translation unless they are personally familiar with the original in the original chinese and if that the case they should write their own version	18
0	i have listened to a bunch of dean koontz books while listening to the second one i saw so many similarities which really turned me off and this flaw continued which each book i listen to which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book however most of the stories were pretty good so i stuck with him this is not the case with this book cold fire is absolutely horrible i so regret purchasing this book it is so bad that i have decided to swear off dean for looooooooong while just on a side note the bad place is the first dk book i read and it was very entertaining	18
0	this book refers to philosophical basis of buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion it is not a manual nor a guide no meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book the style is simbolic and poetical it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content it will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work	18
0	i did not like the book adam of the road because it tells you a whole bunch of stuff about the characters before it gets to the story and by the time you get to the story you forget about the characters i also did not like the fact that the book talks weird and it says like thou father i shall bla bla bla	18
0	this book is not about india or indians shallow characters non existant plot a dismal end to a not terrible beginning unlike one of the other reviewers i was unlucky enough to buy this book what a waste	18
0	the instruction manual in eq2 is quite addiquate regardless of class things you are not sure of are learned as you go or you can post on numerous forums for answers since there are stats on top of stats and such vast areas with tons and tons of resources and itesm to be had this book helps you get an idea of the where and what as in where you may find x or what y actually does and realated stats its a reference guide but as this game is so dynamic this book has a limited lifspan and as you develop in the world you will find it to be old news rather quickly	18
0	ok this book is funny the first time you look through it ! ! ! overall i would not recomend this book because it 's one of those books that you 'll just look through one time and one time only ! yeah there are a lot of positions but they are all repeated in the book like five times with different names ! and another thing there are a lot of positions that are not even posible and some only with a giant swing or how about a horizantal or verticle pole yeah many people have those in their houses but seriously the only positions that you'll be able to do are the ones that you know already ! !	18

0	filled with bizarre generalizations and the most pretentious phraseology i 've seen in years this book has the dubious honor of spotlighting all that has gone wrong in academic research in this country in the last 20 years jodi dean shows an appalling lack of understanding of the workings of culture history politics or even writing style it seems she should have spent more time with turabian 's manual for writers than surfing the web or watching sienfeld	18
0	there is only one 100 whole grain bread recipe in this book most of them are less than 50 whole grain if you want healthy bread recipes try breadtime by cheney or the laurel 's kitchen bread book by robertson every recipe in both of those books is 100 whole grain i doubt that most people considering a book titled whole grain breads are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients with that being said i thought the book had some good recipes and was well written therefore i am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none	18
0	i was disappointed in this book the art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a tv craft show i would instead recomment robert wade 's watercolor book	18
0	rosalind krauss' theories have some merits and if you are looking at a book that will drive you up the wall the entire time shouting at it read this i would never allow my grad students to read this dribble	18
0	book goes over a lot of information in a very short time but not much of that information is worth anything unless you 're building a circle track or drag car took the hit and ordered stanforth 's competition car suspension	18
0	i enjoyed the parts regarding the s s valiant but the later part of the book simply did n't work for me except for picard who we of course know quite well from the series the other characters were flat and uninteresting we never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy of the week boring the whole quot adversarial quot situation with the 1st officer also just struck me as odd and wrong and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for picard	18
0	i'm an electrical engineer and in the telecomm buisness i 've read a lot of books on communications and this has to be one of the worst luckily i did n't pay for it the writing is poor and it does n't commuicate ideas clearly there is better books out there on the exact same subject	18

0	there are plenty of math manipulatives besides a brand name chocolate for children to use to have fun solving math problems how about carrot or celery sticks that they can dip in nutritious yougurt \? m ms have their own math book too why hook children on this commercialism when there are so many healthy alternatives	18
0	great book of course but for this edition oxford used a computer to justify the type on every other line you encounter three or four spaces where there should be only one it may not bother most readers but i'm looking for another publisher 's edition	18
0	reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it for one thing the author still talks about the ussr and east germany and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated it 's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future	18
0	disappointed as an english teacher i expected a more compelling and less hokey use of whitman the first story of the deformed whitman loving boy was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging	18
0	i have always been a prolific reader and rarely do i come across a book for which i can find no value no redeeming qualities but i must extend a hearty congratulations to julia barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement i have ever had the misfourtune to purchace teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense if you are like me and just have to read it just because you 're obsessed with austen buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it	18

0	other reviews have homed in on the frequent nit picking and general vindictiveness of this book i agree with these criticisms but i'm not going to revisit them here the deeper problem lies with the ayn rand institute which only gives scholarly access to persons guaranteed to toe ari 's party line as long as the ayn rand institute refuses full unconditional scholarly access to miss rand 's papers any biographical efforts produced under their aegis will not be taken seriously by anyone who respects proper academic practice nor should they be	18

0	had long looked forward to finally reading this acclaimed novel there are brilliant and imaginative highlights in the book although finding those bits is like looking for light in a black hole a lot of work for very little result i truly believe this is a book that would be more interesting if one increased their medication level way past the recommended daily dosage mark	18

0	i m not a big fan of communism nor of stalin but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war dont waste your money on a propaganda book better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer thats what biographies are supposed to be	18
0	i wanted to like this book but was very disappointed that all it included was a mish mash of vanity fair articles from 1990 2002 with follow up paragraphs that appear to be right out of people magazine	18
0	do you know how clever alan trachtenberg is \? i mean do you really really know \? ! because if not this book is for you trachtenberg 's book is only superficially about indians or americans it is about the obscure conections he can draw between unrelated things because he is very clever you know in so far as this book has a thesis that it is it	18
0	imposible to do so with no item received	18

0	cooper 's book is yet another warm and fuzzy management guru text from yet another management guru who never served a day as a real manager of a real company it contains all sorts of motherhood and apple pie stories along with trite sayings such as quot when you find a back door that 's open close it quot or my personal favorite quot use the lanterns of your life to help light the way quot if you 're looking for an inspirational book one with a solid basis forget this one you 'd be better off reading the daily horoscope	18
0	i liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena however i found it weak on issues facing companies today in china or that the new business economy has created there was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing china in its transition the journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me i disagree with the simplistic conclusion \( among others \) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in china	18
0	i find it difficult to give a self help book much credibility when it is filled with spelling errors grammar errors and printing errors i would think that someone who cares enough to write a book to help people could at least care enough to check her work	18
0	i must say that this book does has a lot of pictures in it showing the aspects of shakespear 's world and plays they are very good and intertaining but i must warn you that the book has a whole chapter with illustrations \( in detail \) of people having sex the book is probably very good if you like reading text books and do n't mind these pictures but i was just too grossed out if you are teaching lit in college and or studying shakespeare this is probably the book that you should use but you should flip through the book first \( i e library book store \) to see if that is what you want on your book shelves	18
0	this book explains very well the growing paranoia of modern parents this is a resolute attack against parenting determinism it is regrettable however that the author 's references are not more scientific than those he reproaches to parenting determinism advocates of using moreover he is not far from praising spanking which is proven very bad for children	18
0	this is a nice book but it does not contain provencal style interiors ! i am not sure how the author came up with that title since anyone who is interested in french country will not find it here if you are truly looking for provencal decorating ideas this is not the book for you confused ! !	18

0	i have read this book mr moon 's quot divide and quit quot mr khosla 's work quot stern reckoning quot amongst others on the subject of the partition ms butalia 's work is so saturated with her personal opinions and idealogy that it almost ceases to be a work on history than the airing of one 's thoughts and mindset almost a diatribe if i may i will agree with what john galt who has written i think he has hit the nail on the head i did not consider this book worth either the money or the time	18
0	i was very disappointed in the content there were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates many of kautskys subjects and scenes appeared to me to be pre watercolor career pencil sketches which i recognized dark somber and sparse in my opinion	18

0	phil jackson groupie and sometime espn com writer charley rosen turns in a fun but sometimes off putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life he develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot however rosen 's personal oddities drag the book down rosen is absolutely obsessed with bodily functions and he repeatedly goes into way too much detail about farting urination defacation etc at times the book reads like an immature third grader 's delight my roommates and i all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable but charley rosen is a really weird guy	18

0	all the reviews so far sound like personal friends of b w who are puffing the book the book is simple and would require more information so why not just go buy a book with more information	18
0	this book is nothing more than a chaotic brainstorm session with no pertinent information at all you could save yourself time with a pen and some paper and a group of friends because thats all this author did book doesnt show you how to start up any of the ideas it just lists them it also has a plethora of grammatical errors and is almost as if the editor did n't even bother to read it before sending it to the presses it is a complete waste of time and not worth the ninety cents it costs to buy it used	18

0	i was interested in dante 's thoughts on hell religion and the afterlife as taught by the catholic church at the time of its writing what i got was a detailed political history of medieval italy this book is great for the first few chapters but then it becomes a repetitive saga synopsis of the each chapter of the inferno go to next layer of hell describe in 20 words or less the torture found there make fun of some political opponents catholic church officials and so forth prepare for further descent in my opinion this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell canto three pretty much has it right 'leave all hope ye that enter	18
0	this book gave me insight into german culture it is no wonderthere was a holocaust with children 's books like these max and moritz are adventurous children and they are caught being caught is n't enough they are ground in a flour mill for punishment not even that suits the miller he feeds their remains to the ducks it instantly reminded me of concentration camp victims being cremated and then turned into soap this story will forever give nightmares	18
0	i must agree with my 1 star friend this book does n't deliver it spends all this time talking about things that we could grasp just by looking in the help section of the program it goes over basic things several times and makes it sound very complicated when it is totally simple this book is good for people who have alot of time to waste and money	18
0	this is not a good study guide for an employment law class too basic and general this may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring firing etc but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney	18
0	uninspired and unsatisying the writing style is austinesque but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not margaret 's motives and emotions are obscure and the author 's assertion that her quot heroine quot has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed quite the contrary	18
0	this novel could not hold my interest i am an anne perry fan but could not get into this book i could n't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting i'm really disappointed because i was looking forward to a new series by her joseph and matthew lost their parents to murder and joseph lost two close friends to murder yet there did n't seem to be much emotion maybe ms perry tried to tell too many stories within one story in reviewing the book it 's hard to pin point exactly why i did n't like this book i would skip this series and read the pitt series	18
0	18 jun 2005as the book progressed it got more and more egoistic to the point where it becomes a turn off towards the end of the book i am surprised that there was so little mentioned of hakeem shaq 's attitude seems to be that since he can score he does not respect centers who ca n't score whereas he respect bill russell but he does give kobe his fair share of spotlight the other book i read was an unabashed hype of shaq so this is a big improvement	18
0	please be aware that this book contains very explicit information about every topic of sexual nature read this book yourself before giving it to your child it discusses oral sex anal sex how to use and purchase condoms masturbation \( for girls and boys \) etc when the author discusses exploring your own sexuality she says that if she had known about masturbating sooner she would have straighter teeth as she would have stopped sucking her thumb the cover of this book gives no clue to the depth of information covered within it is in no way appropriate for a girl under the age of twelve for many parents even the age of twelve would be inappropriate	18

0	you get a view into 60 's white america the only people of color in this book are a policeman and a caricature i do n't have a problem with other seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe this is set in everyday life and i think its best left on the bookshelf it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair not to mention various shades of skin colour the rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one dimensional quot white quot depiction of the world	18
0	this book is trying too hard to emphasize in being funny it is filled with mediocre 'funny' patters that the readers are encouraged to use but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor balancing two forks on the edge of a glass should not be considered magic once you read a few samples the reading becomes stifling knowing that you are not going to learn anything new that other magic books cannot teach you some areas are brighter the photos are clear and it blends magician bios and history within but one can do better with other books around	18
0	this book is best used for viewing its selection of master drawings many of which are superb however its written text is filled with multitudes of factual errors and pseudo intellectualizations it should be noted that this book was not written by hale it was written by one of his students and lacks the quality of hale 's classic drawing lessons from the great masters instead this book loses itself in unimportant erroneous anatomical minutia which will baffle confuse frustrate and ultimatly demoralize the motivated reader it greatly misses the mark in both clarity and presentation of important anatomical theory	18

0	i did n't expect this series of books to be laid out the way they are i am disappointed that the notes are simply a glorified glossary arranged by chapter rather than alphabetical key points from the book are not bulleted or organized based on content presentation rather key terms are defined and that is all	18
0	ms wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of literary criticism or a biography the book suffers from too much critical analysis of sassoon 's poetry and not enough about his life either he was an extremely boring and prosaic poet or ms wilson needs to delve deeper into his intellectual and emotional development really his cricket exploits and his hunting prowess does not lend anything to the very essence of his life ms wilson 's prose is turgid and repetitive an extremely disappointing work	18
0	this book is a cure for insomnia if i ever have trouble falling to sleep i 'll just dig out my old flatland book and i 'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later ! listening to the a square character telling us about his flat two dimensional world is not thought provoking its just confusing ! trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing i mean i understand what flatland would be like but only after i carefully think out what mr square is saying i spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of flatland than i do enjoying the story not very interesting at all even two stars is being generous	18

0	the first novel written by stephenson and it 's a satire on college dorm life pointless rambling and bizarre it 's a good thing he 's improved his writing over the years as this one stunk	18
0	am i the only person that felt this book was twisted disjointed and something was just not working \? the beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired this could have been a great story the author veered off track or something	18

0	do not buy this book this author belives that he can cure dyslexia with his mind 's eye you can not cure dyslexia you just have to learn a different way from the norm with the right tools such as an orton gillingham based program i bought this book by mistake not looking carefully at the author	18

0	was given this book as a freebie someone must be buying up copies for an austinite this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth string techno celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when louis the xiv 's chamber pot was carried by except this is n't the sun king guys get a life or at least an authentic artist to swoon over all of garriott 's stuff was strictly derivative now that we have the real lord of the rings to watch who cares about cheap imitations	18
0	this book was a huge disappointment not only was n't it funny to me it has absolutely nothing funny for kids too bad its not worth the return shipping charges i threw it out	18
0	good book on deal structure but if you want a valuation number check out quot unlocking the value of your business quot	18
0	one at the front the really own words of the master are excellent one must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with bruce lee the rest consists of interviews with the former interviewers however as a paperback this book costs not really a fortune but the words of the master are absolutely worth while as already mentioned at the beginning	18
0	for the most part the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book 's printing but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms be warned there are several places where the book goes awry for example the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal occasionally hunting in pairs problem no tracks of a t rex have been discovered to date a decade and a half after the writing aside from that and a few other points though the book is good reading	18
0	this dictionary is just another long winded pretentious unreadable high brow attempt to legitimize anthropology the authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology if you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions forget this book	18
0	not easy for any beginner to use unless you knew exactly what kind of silver you were trying to identify i e english scottish irish etc it was a bit confusing marks are black amp white some not showing very good clarity and everything is in extremely in small print if you just want to sort through tons of marks and dates this may be for you if you want information about your piece pass it up	18
0	i 've been following bprd since the very beginning and feel that i can say with all sincerity that this series gets better and better with each new story ! the tpb 's are absolutely the way to go if you do n't frequent comic stores \( which i do \) so do yourself a favor and purchase all of the tpb 's kick back in an easy chair with a stock of time set aside and enjoy these bad boys to your hearts content	18
0	oh how i wanted to love devon 's book ! he was such a charming rascal in wicked and such a bore in sinful there was no meat to this story the back of the books summarizes it nicely what would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over 300 pages i admit i only made through about half before skimming and realizing it was n't going to get any better there 's no sizzling tension the love scenes weak and the mystery is predictable i had such high expectations for this boscastle book since drake 's was brilliant and devon 's character seemed such a lovable rogue not a keeper for me	18
0	mr haqqani 's views about his mother country are very dubious the only question i have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner what has he done for his home land \? nothing ! ! ! this book in waste of time	18
0	this book expounds endlessly on how best to limit the impact of people on the backcountry in the very best traditions of the sierra club it 's more of a philosophy book than a quot how to quot book if anyone wants to learn how to backpack and or camp he would be better advised to buy the several books by karen berger and chris townsend in particular the backpackers handbook	18
0	the unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes dan brown look like borges in comparison naming characters guard one just shows you do n't even try to care the plot is so hair brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache i just learned to my horror that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times i 'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise but it 's been ruined forever by this somewhere baby jesus is crying	18
0	after reading a fine balance i could n't wait to read another book by this author i then read his third book called family matters which was good but i was disappointed as it by no means compared to a fine balance i just finished such a long journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots it is my least favorite of the three books by this author it 's hard to believe that someone can right a book like a fine balance which was magnificant and one of the best books i have ever read and then turn our stuff that is at best average	18
0	boring tasteless and unoriginal photographer has an obvious fixation which has kept him from paying attention in many cases to contrast tone and line one star for the big you know what the real model here i'm sure book has its merits but they are n't artistic putting my copy up for sale	18
0	what to say about belarus \? well we spent the day the white russkis commemmorate the end of wwii there so i 've seen it in all of its grandeur not much to recommend it go and see belarus if you missed out on the post wwii east european dictatorships because belarus is the last of its kind a genuine personality cult around the president runs politics and you can get a feel for what it was like in 1970 's e europe guess what you will not like it take some pics of minsk move on to moscow and if you can find a decent hotel in minsk you 've done better than my wife and i did	18
0	it is fiction of course it can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is impossible ! many reviewers are upset upset perhaps but they should not be worried the church is protected by christ 's promise that it will not err any person of faith sees this book as fiction it is a poor attempt to disguise greely 's left wing theology as fiction the message to those liberals who find quot hope quot for their cause in this book it ain't going to happen recommended reading quot women priests and other fantasies quot greely and his followers are delusional	18
0	i was really looking forward to reading this book since i am both a brain researcher and a professional musician first it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted even this was sparse at best he attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it however it became too watered down and even lost me lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments pushing the envelope of science should be award enough for these reasons i can not recommend this book	18
0	at first glance this is a great book however once you 've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration the author illustrator and publisher should be ashamed of themselves we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children 's books as well \? this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind however	18
0	i 've seen much better photos articles on dylan and would not suggest this particular work i will be selling my copy in the used section	18
0	while it may have been well written this book is disturbing and disgusting to put it mildly if you or anyone you know are pregnant or contemplating or trying to have children do not read this book ! this is one book i can honestly say in retrospect i would rather have failed the test on than ever have read	18
0	chris bohjalian is a gifted stylist and it pains me to give this book such a low mark it 's hard to say much without giving away the plot but i found the plot contrived and manipulative too clever for its own good the book started strong but as the main character became more disassociated with reality i became more disassociated with the book i finished it but it was a struggle	18
0	i really want to like thich nhat hanh 's books i want to because people i respect like them because i believe in the value of mindful living but the truth is that i did n't find this book very helpful i have real and continuing struggles with anger and this book while interesting in a round about way is as others have mentioned not directed toward the problem of anger it is a mindful living remix i'm going to keep searching for a great tnh book and when i do i 'll recommend it good hunting	18
0	excellent how to technical reference easy to read and understand a must have book for those interested in biodiesel and or waste vegetable oil	18
0	this book looks like it was written by someone who works in their own garage as a hobby there is no real technical data in this book no hint of professionalism the photos are black and white and most of the time they do n't really show what the book is talking about there are no torque specs little detail or warnings on how things are done with the quality of this book you 're better off saving the 30 and pulling the jeep apart yourself to see how it works	18
0	i wouold only skim this book if you want a general idea about business marketing but do not expect in depth detail about how to truly market your business	18
0	this breviary is disappointing to traditional catholics ! novus ordo catholics will be right at home with this but if you are a traditional orthodox catholic who favors the roman rite and who has been traumatized by the profanations inflicted by iconaclastic innovations this is the same ole same ole vatican ii stuff	18
0	i admittedly have not completed the full book as it is thick however i do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for dfss for example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there does n't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems i therefore think the book is more about six sigma than dfss barry	18
0	camenson definitely has experience in this career with many quot career books quot to her credit however there are better books out there on writing with more information this book follows the same old tired format that vgm books are 'not so' famous for the internet has more info for a lot less money	18
0	the author gives vague advice the calm down be objective cliche advice if you do n't believe me i'm literally quoting him although the author tries to make his book seem original as you can read it 's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances but mixed with the generic advice i mentioned this is not something revolutionary this is rehash save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation you do n't need to read hundreds of pages to do it or spend on what to imagine	18
0	i started reading this book hoping for the best in turn i found that my hopes were n't fulfilled the beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more after the tone changed the book became bitter and boring the characters lost their flare and the whole book lost personality the book became dull and lost appeal to me the book 's writing style in the beginning was original and fun following the death of little red the book slowly fell apart leaving me tempted to stop reading the book if someone asked me to recommend a good book this would not be the one	18
0	i bought this book and was sorely disappointed nothing specific just lots of references to self analyzation to see what you think you want to do you could do this yourself without a book	18
0	this book contains reproducible mini books bingo cards flash cards some word search puzzles and fill in activities in my opinion the fill ins are a bit too challenging i even had trouble with them the only thing in this book really worth it that i could n't make as well myself are the mini books the mini books each contain several different sight words so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them	18
0	no not really since this novella first appeared in harper 's some years back and then was the prologue in underworld this makes the third time it 's appeared in print and while it is brilliant why buy this when you can buy underworld for about the same price	18
0	his fragmentary thoughts are difficult to follow there is some wisdom here and there but not worth the headache you 'll get trying to decipher what is going on in his head here is an example if you say your own name to yourself at such a moment it will seem utterly alien you will then understand the sacrament of baptism huh \? at first i thought his writing may just be over my head but after re reading most of it i realized it was just bad it 's like the whole book was written when he was high or something some very good ideas but most can be found in other better written books	18
0	this is one of kellerman 's poorest books when you finally get to what is going on it is ridiculous do n't waste your time on this	18
0	i really love to get these for my wife surprises are best when i give them to her and she enjoys all of them from this great author but she and i were not happy when i thought i found another of this super special portal series \( having a new cover is nice but its a new publisher with nothing more than marketing in their minds really hated to say this but we all know her books are super great just know this is a reprint before you guy and like others get a little ticked its not new after you fork over the cash and get your hopes up ! peace everyone \) jeff	18
0	what i learned in this book could have been placed on 1 page sure business life is a challenge and your competitors are not your friends but this book did not deliver on facts and details i do n't see much difference between this book and the guru books	18
0	i cannot believe this book had such a high number of positive reviews i have read some bad books in my life but this one is one of the absolute worst ! i am amazed that all the references to child murder and rape can be overlooked by the rest of the reviewers	18
0	i was quite disappointed by this book i was expecting something with more professional level content it 's all very amateur however the artwork used in the examples is sub professional at best i was hoping that the book would deal with some of the specific pre press issues relating to comics artwork but the chapter there was frustratingly slight you would be much better to buy a a more general pre press book the quality of the packaging and printing were also quite poor for a book that cost this much	18
0	this book has a volume number it is one of a series of monographs that have been published i am looking volume 231 but since you do n't mention the volume number i do n't know if this is the volume i'm seeking i will go elsewhere for my purchase	18
0	i can tell you first hand how amazon makes easy money i am a formal seller here at amazon not a big seller but an honest one with a 5 star rating and zero claims however amazon allows dishonest buyer 's to do chargebacks months after a purchase and then has nothing in place to assist seller 's in getting their merchandise back sounds like retail fraud to me ! ! i wish there was a lower rating to give to this website they are truly at the bottom !	18
0	i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details but also historical background because it 's an autobiography i do n't necessarily think that it 's fair to damn the book for being self centered it is about him i do feel however that the book needs better editing and a bit more self examination it 's an okay addition to one 's list of books about everest expeditions which i must admit i 've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re reading into thin air i would n't however use it as my primary source for information or impressions	18
0	ok you guys as i have stated this book let me down ! it practically ends on page 195 and there 's still 65 pages to go ! my advice do n't even start it also i tried the killer 's cousin i was n't pleased with that either so my conclusion if you 're looking for a good read do n't expect nanxy werlin to fulfill your needs if you need good suspenseful stories try lois duncan or caroline b cooney ! one great outstanding wonderful book swimmer graham masterton	18
0	this book was so simplistic i was quite disappointed you get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all a worthy goal but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies i really think one should try to pursue things to their limit he really held back from delving into any dark territory his explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit he always managed to put a happy positive spin on everything which is nice but life is n't that simple	18
0	what a chore this book was to read if it were n't for my ocd about finishing books that i start i would 've read the first couple of chapters and then given up it seems like a wannabe suspense but it 's not it seems like there might be a love story in it but there 's not it feels like there might be a creepy angle in it but there is not what i can gather about this book is that the author thinks she 's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy she tries to make a connection but falls way short read vinegar hill that one was worth it pass midnight champagne by	18
0	the plot in final analysis is trite and overused and the characters are flat and stock tedious and painful to read	18
0	i love the number one detective agency series and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales unfortunately there was no narrative flow making the stories stilted and un interesting maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped i suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable	18
0	i bought this book and also last night based upon the gushing reviews you see above who are they kidding \? the main character is a cad it is far from a tour de force in erotic anything his short stories in last night are only marginally better your time is better spent with other authors	18
0	if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman 's self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student	18
0	the text gets 5 stars for the orientation organization and the on line resources for the text it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course unfortunately i have to deduct 3 stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make this has been frustrating for my students as well as myself however i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market i strongly recommend a new corrected edition	18
0	i have introduced many of my ell high school students to lois lowery and the depth of her characters she is a brilliant writer and capable of inspiring fierce passion in her readers as they encounter shocking details of her utopian worlds i was anxious to read this companion novel and had planned to share it with my class this january although the series is written for 6th graders and older this book 's simplicity in its message language and writing style will inspire no one i am sadly disappointed	18
0	just know this book has you developing code in the sdk not visual studio net if anything that should turn you away from buying this any net programmer will be working with visual studio and not an sdk the sams teach yourself c in 24 hours was completely written for vs net so i am confused as to why this book was not get another book as this one will be only of use for terminology and oop theory it was a waste on money for me	18
0	i love fairy tales ! i was so excited to see the author of beauty had another retelling spindles end has me very confused i am plugging through it and hope when i am done with it a second time i can give it more stars i would not recommend it for younger readers	18

0	this poorly executed story drags on for too long while the town waits for the return of sister north in the end we really do n't care if she ever returns the ending is cliched and predictable a waste of time	18
0	i have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask i have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail it just does n't click for me i f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but i just cannot do it my self	18
0	unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging bear spray do n't waste your time the stories are all re hashed versions of nearly identical situations man goes into the wilderness man sees bear man uses udap bear spray on bear bear retreats this book is one long advertisement for udap ! ! my book was actually misprinted missing 50 pages right in the middle initially i wanted to return my book for a complete one but after reading the rest of 223 pages i did n't want to waste any more of my time with this one story	18

0	talk about self absorbed i guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business i thought the man made some good points but few are helpful to anyone in the real world \( or outside the newspaper business \) nausea sets in after the second chapter neuharth will die an old lonely rich man respected by many hated by nearly all luckily i did n't have to sit through this entire book i put it down quickly	18
0	i am so sorry that i bought this book it is unfortunate that you do not have a penguin or everyman 's library edition first of all the book is too large to read in bed secondly whoever did the proofreading should be fired there are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading if the postage were not so expensive from israel i would return the book to amazon	18
0	someone gave me this book as a gift why i have no idea this book is about as intelligent as a tv sitcom about as funny as a tv sitcom and generally at the level of a tv sitcom i found it neither funny inspiring nor interesting it is in the final analysis proof that any book that purports to be about quot strong quot or quot outrageous quot women will immediately sell thousands of copies regardless of the piffle between the covers and is thus a triumph of marketing over everything probably best for teenaged girls who do n't read much it 's no worse than tv i guess	18
0	this book \( i believe \) is one of lem 's earlier stories and it reads like so so pulp sci fi fiasco \( a true 5 star science fiction novel \) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better i suggest reading this only if you are a lem completist \( i 've read all of his stuff except 2 books \)	18
0	i looked through this book at a craft store the other day and as a person who loves the ocean and seashells i found maybe one project in here that i would consider making just about every project uses a ridiculous amount of shells so imagine the cost would be prohibitive and for this reason projects look overly ornate unless that is the look you are seeking to accomplish i would n't recommend this book try to find decorating with seashells by anita louise cran	18
0	i have not read the original version of this work but the translation lacks originality and art a beautiful story but the writing style lacks grace and creativity this is the only time i have liked a movie better than the book do yourself a favor and skip the book the movie is quite beautiful and moving	18

0	if you like redon for his vibrant color look for another book dream symbolism and spirituality that inspired redon 's imagery are the main topics of this book most of the many examples are black and white drawings however the real magic of redon is his use of color in his mature works this was not adequately represented	18

0	this book is the worst book ever i did n't know there could possibly be a book this bad if you are required to read this book like me i feel bad for you do not read this book for pleasure because it is not a pleasant book it is painful to read if you are still thinking of reading this bad book don't read it ! ! take my advice	18
0	if you adore the intellect and see in it the only way to the highest purest and most divine knowledge than this is your book but it is n't mine page after page of speculation about the higher realms open only to a mind freed from the crude considerations of the flesh i kept hoping that plotinus would realize his vision and disappear before finishing but it did n't happen	18
0	frankly this book brings nothing new we already know everything there is to know about jackie and diana do n't we \? i sincerely regret having paid such a high price to read what i already knew ! i found the book quot mrs kennedy quot much much more interesting	18
0	the information is sketchy and factually incorrect in some places and the book would appear not to have been proof read for example the botanical names are mis spelled in several different ways there are much better books on the subject available	18
0	the book reads like a shallow way too long magasine article the shop seems to specialize in self help books so there 's hardly a literary feel to it the style too is annoying for example she writes that her dad was n't big on books i would have expected a slightly bigger vocabulary then that	18
0	this book started off very good but as i read on the reading became ardious i found it hard work to finish this book i do n't know why i had such a hard time enjoying the book while all the other reviewser thought it was the best thing since sliced bread but i would read another shark book such as shark trouble or close to shore rather than waste my time on this book	18
0	i am extremely dissapointed with this new edition of the text and have one advise only if you own 2nd ed do not indulge in this new edition for even the errors \( spellings for one \) are xeroxed onto the new edition therefore for a review of the text itself you may without any compunction refer to 2nd ed 's comments of which there are many	18
0	this is another wierd book by shirley maclaine it is neither interesting nor a helpful guide book for pilgrims the book is just a long rambling new age rant published because the auther is shirley maclaine too bad really do n't waste your money on this one	18
0	although i am a psych student with a pretty good gpa i find this book difficult to understand the difficulty seems to come from the authors' desire to condense as much information as possible in just a few hundred pages this leads to a cryptic language where some terms are defined only once and some sentences become a string of such words a thing which personally frustrated me	18
0	do you like romance novels \? do you call your dogs your babies \? this is the book for you the thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge this was my first johansen novel and it most certainly will be my last two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends	18
0	i tried i really did but i could n't get beyond 100 pages i love iris johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one almost as if she were forced to do so it contained none of her usual style the dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters i'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical ij style	18

0	many of the columns were interesting painting a picture of a vast right ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete without any interest either as themselves or as a theme does anyone care about texas state politics in 1989 or phil gramm 's problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate \? someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read	18

0	i visit england frequently i have an earlier edition of this book which i find to be very useful even now the new version leaves out a lot of the good places that were in the old book and it lacks credibility i have a hard time taking any of it seriously when it tells me that an english pint is 16 ounces anyone who is serious about english beer knows that an english pint is 20 ounces	18
0	with someone like this teaching you a failing grade is the likely outcome why dunn feels it neccessary to quote from one of shakespeare 's most ridiculus plays and behave as if he is possessed is beyond me it 's not funny or necessary and the problem is that the book is full of it literally if you are looking to learn the solid fundementals of chemistry you should pass this one by and go with something like wiley 's chemistry concepts and problems in which you begin learning immediately in a simple straightforward manner for anyone to suggest that a book like this should be part of any school 's curriculum is just absurd	18
0	the professionals in the law field in this book are n't the type of lawyer or law professional most people want to become i understand not everyone becomes a six figure paid lawyer right out of law school but this book is ridiculous it shadows a guy who wants to only be a law clerk \? give me a break	18
0	the text is ok and the way the story is cut up in frames and assembled is competent but the drawings are the work of a hack often tacky and always styleless and garishly colored the costumes and settings are totally lacking in imagination and carry no semantic weight the attempts to create a visual equivalent for the musical leitmotifs of the operas are too literal and very much in the spirit of a mechanical translation from opera to comic book an affront to connoisseurs of either opera or comics or both only valuable as a kitschy curiosity	18
0	the writing was not what i expect of andre norton too many gaps and information that is disjointed whether this is a consequence of collaboration i do n't know i felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened for example at the start we know kirion has sent people to capture his sister the book covers over 2 years but you hardly hear of this again i cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop i am a long time fan and retired children 's librarian sic fi fantasy is my favorite genre but this one i had to push to finish unsatisfying	18
0	wow ! i read all these great reviews and thought this would be a great book luckily i got it out of the library did n't buy it i liked it at first but then the situations got more more implausible then i was reading it just to laugh at it some of the sentences in the book were completely ridiculous too if i had the book here at work with me maybe i could quote a couple descriptions that just had me rolling my eyes not a well written book at all in my humble opinion glad the rest of you enjoyed it anyway	18
0	i have read other books by alesia holliday and enjoyed them so i looked forward to reading this book unfortunately i could not get any farther than the first 25 pages i even tried diving in further into the book to see if it got better and i still could not read more than 5 pages without turning away the best i can do to pin down why i dislike it so much is to say that it tries too hard no character seems to even approach reality they are all including the main character and her love interest over the top	18
0	this booklet has a lot of warner brothers drawings but it does n't delve into the specifics of creating animation very well i 'd recommend getting the animator 's survival kit instead as it has tons of good and well explained info on the art of creating your own animation	18

0	not even worth finishing this book ! this author does not know enough to even write this book ! i have personal connections with blackwater and i know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be it is a one sided story not based on facts which it what most writers do but purely fiction ! the only few misfortunes blackwater has had is what he bases his book on not the postive stories that i hear about everyday do n't waste your money	18

0	this book was written in the '80s was copy written in 1990 it has a folksy tone and some technical information unless you are buying your church 's sound system at a second hand store this book is going to leave you wondering what might be available today for example cd recorders are under development	18
0	i'm very disappointed in this book although some information in it is valuable it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover it is an excellent textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular basis and find ideas for what you need although broken into sections they are not readily found or visible one must search the information needed as in a research assignment the reproducibles are mainly for elementary grades this was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it 's contents on line although the price was reasonable i'm not pleased with the way the book is organized amp printed	18
0	this book offers more information about santa claus than it does the gods godesses associated with the winter soltice the craft projects are cheesey and the recipes terrible save your money and do a little research yourself and if you want recipes or craft projects pick up one of those special christmas magazines for ideas you can adapt for a pagan holiday theme	18
0	this book is poor it 's not quot philosophical quot in any sense because it 's not logical and it 's not supported by the majority of music scholars today reimer contradicts himself at every turn he does n't understand what langer is really saying and his absolutist notion of music is completely out of synch with what most scholars argue about music today reimer just mouths a lot of fluffy feel good nonsense	18

0	the book appears to give comprehensive coverage in terms of the number and type of entries included however on the atkins diet the important measure to monitor is the quot active quot carbohydrate mass which may metabolised and which excludes roughage or fiber the inclusion of such a measure in the book would greatly enhance its value and utility	18
0	two huge problems with this book one this self righteous club is leaving clues to a killer and traveling and learning when they already know his identity so i guess he can keep on dismembering women until the psychiatrist figures it all out and then gets teary eyed over his new special wine glass two the city of los angeles functions as a character in kellerman 's other novels and adds alot of realism to the novels this thing drags on in some unnamed nondescript city	18
0	it 's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting written with blatant self promotion in mind for other garrett products there is little if any substantive information on panning that could not be reduced to 4 or 5 pages with a couple of diagrams added would appear author may have been paid by the word given the tedious repetitions found throughout truly basic and nothing new here spend your money elsewhere	18
0	this book is very dissapointing sure this book is full of information but does not know how to teach this book is not completely written in step by step method before you actually start touch your project you are fed up with information i even found a couple of mistakes in earlier chapter dvd comes with this book but this dvd is not a lesson project like apple pro training series not useful if you are beginner and start studying dvd studio pro 4 do n't by this book ! you 're going to waste your money buy the one from apple pro training series which is much better easy to understand	18

0	i was also disappointed with evanovich 's latest book if i read this book not knowing who the author was i would have guessed it was written by her it 's amazing how many of the character 's actions and spoken words are strikingly similar to the plum series agree that the pugg character is really annoying ! ! i am a huge evanovich fan and have read most of her non plum books but would have to say this is my least favorite looking forward to the 13th plum in june	18
0	ugh i did not even try to finish the book it is full of sexual content not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature	18

0	melrose larry green 's book is full of quotes quotes and information used to back up points are good things he appears to have researched by surfing the internet watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others this is all fine and acceptable the problem with why the clintons belong in prison is when the author \( cut and paste expert \) attempts his own narrative which is sporadic jumpy and poorly edited his points are not linear and show the author 's attention deficit with a proper literary team this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a hit and run report and reads like a one sided sensationalized talk radio program	18
0	yuck this book was totally boring well maybe you 'll like it if you 're like 7 or 8 years old or something not only is it totally boring but poorly written which surprised me because ann m martin is certainly not a bad writer ! i'm really glad she left the bsc and started writing a new series about them the bsc books are soo boring and childish please a hard to handle babysitting adventure is when the dog runs loose for 2 seconds do n't waste your time reading the bsc books they are all pretty dumb	18
0	i love peterson 's guides but the birds of mexico is severely lacking the art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to north america but unfortunately it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other peterson guides perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of peterson guides but otherwise buy howell 's or edward 's guides both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone howell 's is certainly the most complete but edward 's guide is a bit handier in the field	18
0	a useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing accounting standards and approaches between countries however it is not worth the price it is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students it is more suitable for general second year accounting students plus as i am working with a multinational european bank in japan the book is rapidly becoming out of date there is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries	18

0	as a complete newbie to xml this was a good starter as i got deeper into xml i found several mistakes deficiencies in the book and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about for instance the claim on page 86 that \( cdata \) is a valid dtd element content definition is flat out wrong his description of schema element declarations \( pp 114 115 \) teaches that using globals refs is the only way to define complex elements and is inappropriate for his example he makes no mention of globals at all leaving the reader confused i have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of xml information	18

0	this book has too many errors there is nothing more frustrating than to follow the steps outlined and find out it does not work because they did not q a the examples ie they ask you to select a field from the table but the field does not exist the stored procedure does not include it you would have to know how to write sql to correct this	18
0	this was the first collin wilson book i read he has probably read a lot to write this book but to anyone at least a little into the occult it is clear that he have no idea what he is talking about if you are interested in this matter \( the occult knowledge \) as something you would read about but never ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything maybe this book is ok but if you are serious about it and really want to know what true and what is fake please stay away from this book he is so wrong about even simple things that could have been verified with just a few months of practical experimentation	18
0	the only good thing about this book is that it was short even in writing about a great man with incredible contributions to our country gary hart repeats himself over and over and over and over again ok the monroe doctrine is important i get it ! i read about 2 or 3 presidential biographies per month and i cannot remember a book as bad as this if you want a quick view of james monroe you can read the first chapter and skip the rest but this book is not good for more than that	18
0	this is for beginners it 's filled with useless forms and it provides very little information beyond a common sense and reasoned approach to real estate surely there must be better resources than this	18
0	i found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women men are to rule and women are to submit to that rule the authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level i suggest anyone who reads this books should also read discovering biblical equality it gives another view of how the christians world see the role of women	18
0	this book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle read the fat fallacy instead it provides much more practical information	18
0	another hyprocritical nut these christian fundamentalists like are literally screaming jesus while cutting your throats not unlike the jihadi fundamentalists the only thing is they cant do that now as they used to couple of hundred years back by enslaving and lynching blacks killing native americans and showing their christian love for the jews by exterminating them hope our future generations dont have to live in a christian saudi arabia this is what these whackos envision	18

0	the humor is definitely not in the book reviews and summaries use the word hilarity however i did not come across any situation that i would classify as even funny not to mention hilarious i thoroughly enjoyed her first novel pink slip however this one seemed depressing the two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story the plot seemed to be very slow the whole story took place in a matter of days but really nothing took place in the book all in all they bought a house i would pass on this for better reads elsewhere	18
0	i do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations in chapter 5 he explains steady state error for unity feed back horribly he says the value of c \( t \) must be infinite or nonzero but doesnt bother to show why this book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions its not all bad but its not 5 stars everyone else has given it i have read good textbooks this isnt one of them	18
0	tedious and inane come to mind it is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a catty pseudo feminist style rambling descriptions of egyptian archaeology real or imagined thinly veiled racist comments about the ignorant natives of egypt and inept sexual innuendo the book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced the characters do not come across as real very disappointing leave this one on the library shelf	18
0	this book is for the diehard dave navarro fans only the only reason i gave it 2 stars was that the use of instamatic photos in the book is creative the text is nothing more than diary entries by the guitarist neil straus approached writing the dirt with motley crue is a much more creative way which kept me interested this book falls short unless i would have been inclined to want to see things dave 's way i grew restless of this pretty quickly	18

0	this book does cover alot of information not needed for clep but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep i wanted to ensure i was prepared for the clep so i purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments although they were right about the obscurity this book still taught me alot you do n't necessarily need it but if you want to be prepared this book will not hurt your bank account that much i also recommend the complete itiots guide to american literature \( 5 stars check out the reviews \) and the internet that is all you need	18

0	i seem to be in the minority but i did not enjoy this book at all the main character is of course the only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness i felt the plot got swallowed up by the author 's need to self insert and 'play' in her world and the only reason i finished this book was that i was on a plane and had nothing else to do the plot fishtails several times and is n't all that interesting to start with in short i was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general and will likely skip her books in the future	18
0	this series is a travesty i understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series but let laura not macbride have the last word on her family 's experience so much in his books rings false the clumsy historical allusions the narrative voice the potty humor one of the greatest things about laura ingalls wilder 's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she the main character grows big woods is written for little girls and happy golden years for young women macbride does n't manage this and talks down to readers there is a tiny thread of laura in these books but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans sampling is for rap not fiction	18

0	while the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive what i think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics an example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter but does n't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together he just tells you that you need to tie them together what if you do n't have a shoelace to use \? what other alternates are there \? this book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire but it 's not enough for the serious camper	18
0	i saw the tv show made so i wanted to check out the full story it was a disappointment but my wife loved it so there you are one against one for it	18
0	i have yet to read this book however so far the average rating is quite suspicious each one of the three reviewers does not have a single other review in their profile i am at the stage where i am trying to learn as much as possible about spreads' trading so i would greatly appreciate if someone who actually has real life experience trading futures spreads and who has also read this book to do everyone of the rest of us a favor and post an honest review please we need a counterbalance to the nonsense posted by those who are most likely associated w the author or his publisher	18
0	unlike most of the other reviewers here neither i nor my nine year old enjoyed this book the premise is good but the family values morality is heavy handed and the writing limps along	18
0	seven times the sun is not for everyone it could be a springboard offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life but the songs poems and traditions offered in shea darian 's book are hokey and contrived at best cumbersome and artificial at worst none of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book darian is a minister and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent true parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have but i'm just thankful amazon has a customer friendly return policy	18
0	this would have to be the worst book i have ever read wow will is running from dead people some one is trying to kill him so cool how much more boring can you get i would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater so what i'm saying is it stinks	18
0	there was nothing in this book that our association has n't covered nearly every week i was very dissapointed it offered little tidbits like quot a postgame review can help you learn from experience quot do n't we all do quot postgame reviews quot even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home \? i certainly do no i'm not he best umpire in our association i would rate myself as somewhere in the middle the book offered me nothing new nothing that our association does n't talk about constantly buy a childress or save your money	18

0	some photographers think what 's erotic is what 's hidden and left to the imagination two thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing leaving plenty to the imagination think of playboy magazine in the 1950 's or vogue or madamoselle magazine today many of these are stylistic but not very erotic one in three of the photos in the book are erotic not afraid of nudity do n't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism instead get shaven angels natural beauties 100 naked girls or crazy sexy girls	18
0	for all of you looking for that favorite book the silly book join my club \( not literally \) the book that has the ode to boodleheimer was written by stoo hample not babette cole i have been searching for this book for years good luck everyone and let me know if you find an extra copy for sale	18
0	i ordered this for a friend thinking it was the same bruce fisher book i bought when i divorced it is only the workbook and really needs a workshop \( or maybe just a book \) to go with it it was a total waste of money and not what i expected when i ordered make sure you are ordering the book not the workbook when you order	18
0	i had high expectations for this book but i was disappointed it concentrated too much on digital systems rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment i lost interested in the last 1 3 of the book and could n't wait to finish	18
0	what happened to this book \? it is a disgrace to the star wars universe it 's practically a star wars dictionary that 's all in spite of the good pictures this book was very disappointing ! ! !	18
0	i am absolutely furious about this book i quit reading about half way through i read it through the section about it 's a wonderful life \( chapter 13 \) in that chapter i found three mistakes not minor details but major provable points including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene within four paragraphs if eliot 's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs how can i trust the rest of the information in the book \? avoid this at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	18
0	the book contained more profanity than i expected to read in a book by rita rudner i had expected more humor from a comedienne too bad because i really like her humor	18
0	if excelsior college did n't require this for the cpne i would take it and throw it off the highest bridge i could find horribly confusing does n't make sense and i cannot fathom how this would help your clinical practice the only redeeming feature is that excelsior does not let you write in this so i will have a brand new copy of this for sale to some poor nursing student i do n't mean to sound harsh but this book is n't easy to use it is confusing and contradicts itself	18
0	this is a very popular book which is sad because it 's highly biased she provides evidence but only uses the 10th that corroborates her story christian study maybe christian fact very loosely	18
0	i agree with the above comments all one sees is a black cover the book looks sounds interesting but there is no table of contents or example of what is inside the book this book needs to present more information if you expect one to buy	18
0	well after i received the book i have to say i was quite disappointed because i am one of those people who gives great importance to presentation in the books after i read the reviews i thought i was going to get a book with lots of nice photographs and various nicely set tables it turned out that it was just like an encylopedia with lots of recipes and couple of boriiinggg pictures if you are a visual person like me who likes to read cookbooks when you go to bed dont buy it the other important thing was that many important ingredients were missing in the greek food that was presented	18
0	this book is a place to start at best the main part of middle eastern cook that i find enjoyable is the use of fresh produce and spices this book calls for dried spices at times the dishes do n't produce the food that i remember eating growing up with my family the book is not a total loss however the spinach pies are acceptable there are many other books out there that i would recommend first	18

1	as a casual piano player and a broadway fanatic i was so jazzed to play some of the songs from avenue q the book contains everything you find on the cd and includes a few production photos of course the little details are fun using terms like manilowesque huey lewis shuffle prissy sonata and funky a groove to describe some of the songs fun fun fu	18
1	this is one of the best biographies i have ever read you can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work it 's a true labor of love filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes this one is a keeper who knew miss francis was such a wild child \? whether you 're a film scholar or a movie buff lynn kear 's book deserves a special spot in your bookcase	18
1	i read this book many many years ago on a very long flight i could n't put it down the philosophy is simple live frugally save invest money every month and you too can be a millionaire it 's great advice especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house expensive car and everything else right now with no regard to the future although some of the info is dated \( enron being named as a great company to invest \) and some other advice \( putting new soles on old shoes \) is a bit much the general message makes plenty of sense	18
1	zadie smith is one of the most powerful authors i have read in recent times she is so subtle about the race factor that we do n't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so she has also captured the emotions of kiki and zora perfectly \( why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments ! \) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down if you enjoyed the movie crash you will love this one	18
1	zig ziglar has done it again as an author myself of sales books i realize sales is about so much more than just having the 'gift of gab ' and fast talking it 's about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers it 's about not just being a consultant to others but being a consultant to yourself it 's recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is zig 's theories exemplify this	18

1	i loved this book the food was really good and fast \( which is good because i have a very packed schedule \) also great if you 're on a budget the recipes have variations so i could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants the only reason it did n't get five stars was because some of the food was really spicy \( i'm from texas i like spicy \) to the point my boyfriend could n't eat it i just modified the recipes and everything was fine	18
1	the journal format is a unique take on the genre and i especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival the author obviously knows his stuff what 's also impressive is that this novel is self published i'm surprised someone has n't taken notice and offered j l bourne a deal he 's good	18

1	great story ! ! excellent in fact my beef is with the narrator and editor as someone who grew up in the baltimore area i thoroughly enjoyed the local references however it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce baltimore icons like boog 's bbq at camden yards for the record it is not pronounced bow g ! it is boo g do better research ! !	18
1	this is an extraordinary biography for while blumenson 's admiration for george patton is evident it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of patton 's personality both positive and negative the book truly goes beyond the popular perception of the general and far beyond the movie in exploring his character and motivations not an overly long book but thorough detailed and very enjoyable to read	18
1	gibbon 's decline and fall is without a doubt one of the most well written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the roman empire from the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the imperial court gibbon showcases the history of rome as it unfolded often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time there are a few minute problems or rather gaps in gibbon 's work but given that he originally published in the late 1700 's we can excuse his lack of complete information overall an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject	18
1	i have probably close to a dozen or more people i know including myself that have read this and had great results removing all sorts of chronic symptoms	18
1	this book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low income communities of color in new york city necessary reading for those who still do not realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further fragment and disenfranchise them	18
1	patriotic terrorist fighting storyline exposes the political games played in washington that many times put our military in dangerous situations this book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the special forces men who are so brave i know the book is fiction but i ca n't help but feel that it is more truth than fiction mitch rapp 's wife anna is getting a little hard to stomach she is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man again hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations i hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it although 95 is absolutely wonderful and inspiring portraying men as real men	18
1	since 1965 i 've taught this truth based upon metaphysical studies now at last there is scientific evidence supporting the fact that emotions create facts	18
1	tom friedman 's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts webs and walls states v markets v individuals and the comprehensive failure of the arab street leadership and muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day are extremely well thought out from reading this compilation of nyt columns i understand where friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best selling book 'the world is flat ' although i sometimes disagree with his opinions his ability to see the big picture is spot on	18
1	i bought this book just recently and was really touched \( and cried \) by the whole experience that gus had went through he has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance \( stephanie \) and without her he could 've been out there on the street again overall it 's a good book to read and i always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another this book is a genuine prove	18

1	tina dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case which encompasses motherhood mental illness child abuse and matricide dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion that in and of itself is impressive because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other get caught up in emotion and appear unable to really present all sides of the story lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society 's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention it is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them but also tragically failed their mother	18

1	you definetly should read this book ! do n't believe what the 1 star writers are saying they do n't want you to know the truth ! the left claims that bin laden would never side with saddam because of their beliefs yet the left is adamant that osama bin laden was funded by the united states go figure ! we all knew there was a connection and stephen hayes demonstrates so with great care ! there is a connection with al qaeda and iraq and the book explains it in detail	18

1	leah stewart is a talented writer i read this book after finishing her most recent novel the myth of you and me \( which i highly recommend \) this story is dark and chilling olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in memphis on a hot summer when the body of girl is found the case becomes eerily personal for olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl 's story and life the characters in this novel are deep and well developed and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in memphis is well rendered i highly recommend this book	18
1	this is an excellent book its academic sociological approach may put off some lay readers but that would be too bad the subject and the message are both very important in many ways this book is similar to quot the appearance of impropriety how the ethics wars have undermined american government business and society quot but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social science standpoint an excellent book well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed \( at best \) results	18
1	i bought this as i'm beginning to study judaism in my spiritual journey the book is very well translated and includes recommendations for readings on holidays there are also pictures throughout the book from various times and locations i'm also very pleased with this since it 's in a paragraph format \( as someone who 's only read the hebrew bible as part of the old testament i like the ease of reading with the paragraph format \) highly recommende	18

1	this was a very informative read i have gotten so many great ideas and will be using many of them in my own coastal garden this is much more than a typical gardening how to book there is so much wisdom here and also some interesting facts organic gardening is my first love and i was pleased to see ms hadley insist on it in her own garden a garden by the sea reads like a story as well as a great resource for gardening information i agree with the other reviews here it is like talking with a friend this book has become a treasured addition to my library	18
1	sadly as a rule i have no great interest in history but ms behrman 's approach brings the person of thomas jefferson to life in a way that appeals to all ages she puts personality and emotion into her writing which makes potentially dull facts dates and events brim with energy this is a wonderful series and she does it justice in every way	18
1	this is a superb collection and a true tribute to this incredible photographer	18
1	i have been procrastinating in upgrading our website so i figured i 'd read a few books a great way to procrastinate some more well marcia writes in a step by step practical way creating a marketing foundation first then getting to the beef i'm now educated and inspired have a notebook full of notes and ideas that i'm actually implementing it 's getting done i'm actually recommending this book to friends who are redoing their marketing message since the first two chapters do that so well great book not heavy beefy info	18

1	as someone who lived not far from brownsville in the 1950s and early '60s i can say this is an exceptionally accurate book it is well written and is the best attempt i 've seen yet at explaining the phenomenon of the changing urban neighborhood not only does pritchett provide many well reserached well thought out answers but just as important he raises insightful penetrating questions i highly recommend this book to anyone interested in american urban history particularly as it relates to new york city	18
1	as a boy i was fascinated by looking at all of the drawings and descriptions in this diary it gave me a great appreciation for life in the us in the early 1800s and the fortitude and ingenuity of our forefathers i have found that the magic still holds as i read it to each of my sons when they were about 8 they still love the basic how to descriptions which bring frontier construction to life	18
1	this book is as much about life as it is about baseball the positive re enforcement the book gives about accomplishing almost anything is the true message whenever you or one of your players is struggling go back to this book to refresh a slumping attitude	18
1	if you are looking for ideas and techniques this is a wonderful book very well done	18
1	this is a simple book to read through for younger children written by native americans it is a thanksgiving book from their point of view why native americans have always celebrated thanksgiving it has no mention of pilgrams or not fully proven overly romanticized stories as most thanksgivings are but simply a beautiful description of the season the great harvest and respect for the world around them a book of why the native americans gave thanks during this beautiful season	18
1	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
1	i bought the kr party bundle for my boyfriend 's daughter for her birthday she loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead it started with the static for a while but then while i was singing it just died completely i know i'm not a great singer but i'm not that bad	13
1	i bought this mic in december and after only two nights of singing it completely died ! what a complete disappointment save your money !	13
1	this game was originally released for 10 dollars almost everything about it is pulled straight from diablo and is not quite as good though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people i would just skip this game and go for diablo 2	13
1	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
1	i used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it 's just not good	13
1	the vertical stand is wonderfull but why \? you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape i put my ps slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product \? i bought it just for kicks literally	13
1	not as much fun as i remember maybe better if they had a better selection of games \( one on one hardball etc	13
1	i purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting however what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset the screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons what was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	13
1	i was really excited when i saw this item was out ! i had the commodore 64 when i was a kid and my brother and i used to spend hours and hours playing games on it i was so glad to see that winter games and summer games was included until the item arrived and i plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick does n't work at all when you move it to the right so you can only use it to go up down or left big dissapointment do n't waste your	13
1	we got this game free in a box of corn chex we thought oh this will be fun since the show is cool so we got home and played it and it was so annoying ! there 's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background just do n't buy it if you want to have any fun	13
1	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
1	if you are looking for codes like game shark had this is not for you not only do you have to have a computer if anything happens to the disk you are screwed you wo n't be able reinstall windows or install it on a new computer some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for 100 completion so if those are they games you plan on using this is the best thing out there	13
1	returned item for refund found it cheaper at toys r u	13
1	small memory which means that u can only put 1 save on it so u have to run back to your comp everytime u wanna save ! ! ! and software is veery confusing ! ! ! horrible buy ! ! ! i returned the piece of junk ! !	13
1	i am extreamly dissapointd with this game every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location there is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings	13
1	as was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for they gave us advent children cell phone games and finally dirge of cerberus this game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under used and least interesting character in the final fantasy series its the creators way of telling us that they will never re make final fantasy vii but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man	13
1	all of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs ing you those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans that game was barely mediocre at best other ff7 releases advent children cell phone game and movie tv show thing all three things resectively sucked now comes dierge of cerberus whoop did eeee doo ! ! the only reason why i rented it was because the title says final fantasy in it the only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes other than that boring if you can get more than 20 minutes through the game then by all means it 's the game for you	13
1	i ca n't stand this game after 5 minutes the game is so unresponsive its not funny the first board i wanted to throw my remote my friend watching asked me what the hell was going on i seriosly did n't move the remote at all and my guy starts spinning around at first i thought maybe the control calibration is wrong but then i was playing trauma center before and after red steel and not once did i have a problem with the controls seriously the worst game i ever played	13
1	this is a perfect example of false advertisement if you 're like the many that i 've heard of trying to order a remote for the playstation 2 do n't order this one unless you have a newer model the picture shows an ir unit but it does n't come with one so save yourself the hassle and do n't order this	13
1	i saw a dvd player at target for 30 yesterday i especially do n't see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it 's 40 ! ! space saving maybe \? \? \?	13
1	my only experience with this product was after i opened it and started to play a dvd in my xbox when i tried to pause it it did n't work and it had brand new batteries i found \( after much frustration \) that if i smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes i took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so i just got my money back you can buy a dvd player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	13
1	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
1	this just sucks the main person just keeps running around he just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board no fwd bike control he wo n't peddle but gos backwards quite well tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked atleast i bought it used and for not much money maybe ill find a fix and try it again later	13
1	i have n't even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my ps2 after the ps2 logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens i thought it was maybe just that disc but i exchanged it and the same thing happened i called ubisoft and they said many people with the slim ps2 have called to say it does n't work but they do n't have any answers sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many ps2 's do not buy if you do n't want the risk of it not working ! ! ! !	13
1	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13
1	why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can \? these memory cards are way over priced i love ps2 it 's one of the best systems i have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam i already own 2 cards and i need more	13
1	this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it 's just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	13
1	i gave it one star because there was no way to give it less this game when played on the x box was great so when it came out for pc i bought it big mistake ! the control are too hard to learn and when you are in a battle you ca n't stop to think which keys when used together work there are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing i wasted my money on this game i deleted it and will never play it do n't waste your money	13
1	this is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection i 've ever experienced i bought this game new at a local store because i 've been itching to play simcity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card got this game home and it installed just fine but when it came time to launch the game it said disc authentication failed tried it with the other disc failed again went to the company 's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund	13
1	do n't buy it unless you want the starforce malware on your computer i understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers i need \( ed \) for my dvd burner check the search engines and see for yourself would have otherwise been a great game too bad it is n't playable because of this malware	13
1	starforce nothing else need be said starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games i do n't know since not a single one will play on a dell xps gaming laptop	13
1	this game sucks it tries to be sim city with extra features unfortunately the graphics are way below average in fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student the interface is clumsy and not intuitive i am a big fan of the sim city series and this game really falls short	13
1	this game has starforce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer reportedly it replaces your cd and or dvd drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems i 've been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive scsi scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it it could be the best game that 's ever been produced but anyone who 's had the starforce experience is going to steer clear	13
1	i purchased this remote control to make watching dvd 's on the ps2 easier i had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box i had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work i hoped it would get better but it only got worse i am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away i would never recommend this product	13
1	this is supposed to be an x box cleaner but the system does not read the disc a shoddy product	13
1	people i do n't know what you see in this game it 's not really a bad game it 's just an average arcade shooter more often than not i ca n't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly i pop out from behind something and i'm dead meat pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis game	13
1	i 'd like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it does n't work on lcd televisions it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets	13
1	my nephew really needed a new controller so i ordered this along with a game for his birthday the game was received fine but he never received the controller i finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on amazon the delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by amazon so the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation who knows the controller could have been wonderful \? \?	13
1	i got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun well it caught my interest for a few weeks then i just got bored with it i 'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily	13
1	i bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage	13
1	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	13
1	when i bought the xbox on 6 11 06 it came at a very good rate of time my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke i do n't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months i ca n't say the person that sold me the xbox has even tried to email me since i 've emailed him hmmmm	13
1	this game is horrible i rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it i had wasted 5 bucks its patheticic you cant do anything graphics are horrble cutscenes are as long as some commercials and the characters are gay pros sunny can bite yaycons horrbiel graphicsonly 3 playable charactersbad humorshort cutscenesu cant do anything1 path gamehardly 3d \( seriously it doesnt look like it	13
1	this extension cable did not work with my standard microsoft s controller unless you still use the old monster sized xbox controller these cables are worthless	13
1	tediously long and weary nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from rtcw hl2 etc i am sick of this	13
1	beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful ! not to mention the monsters level up with you so you 'll never be at an advantage you could pretty much beat the game at level 5	13
1	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13
1	try before you buy ! this game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again beware	13
1	if you are looking for an xbox vertsion of another chapter in mechwarrior series this isn't it this is an extemely dumbed down version of mw even if you \( mechwarrior fans \) forget about having no customization remember this you can only fire one weapon at at time you have to cycle between lazers cannons and rockets i was bored after about 5 minutes again people who never played mw series may like this game better	13
1	i hate this game its the worst game i 've ever played	13
1	every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie \( from russia with love which is actually not a bad game \) recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this i simply could n't resist picking up scarface the world is yours i loved the movie scar face and i was gonna love this but it turns out i did n't the controls are really a joke instead of your normal fps 3ps rpg etcetera there are really bland controls you ca n't even tell what to do the dialouge is corny and everything else is a joke for die hard fans only i guess	13
1	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
1	i noticed there were not many new items in this game i found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving this expansion ws not worth the money	13
1	this pack offered very little of anything the decor \( very little of it \) is uninspired i was hoping to get some good artwork at least i know a lot of people do n't like to download from fan sites but do n't waste your money on this junk believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did this is the first and last stuff pack that i will ever buy	13
1	nothing more really needs to be said i'm running a 3ghz p4 256mb ati radeon 9000 series pci express video card and 2gb of ram and the game still hangs lags and locks up on my computer i tried uninstalling reinstalling same effect do not buy this gam	13
1	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	13
1	all i have to say is this game is not for 'everyone' ! ! you have to be able to read to play ! last time i checked not everyone can read i bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum he can master just about every game i get him but he ca n't read so for him this game was not much fun i ended up playing more than he did and i did n't even enjoy it	13
1	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	13
1	i had high hopes on this game but i was disapointed the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad the story line was basically typical it really did n't hold my interest for long i did beat the game because i spent 50 on it the day it came out and i figured i would at least do that i gave the game to a friend of mine after i beat it and he had the same opinion as i did it 's worth renting but definately not worth buying hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	13
1	this game is really bad i mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money i gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam	13
1	being a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this the graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot vr quot points becomes annoying after awhile the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that 's with playing with a ps2 gun \( i ca n't imagine shooting with a controller \) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot vr quot points the dialog gets annoying too and you ca n't skip hearing it either	13
1	this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy does n't respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just do n't play the pc version borrow someone 's xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	13
1	i thougt there would be a better story line and what i found was very disappointing the boss \( mcgruder \) was easier to beat than the boss in the matrix path to neo i mean i paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously i was wrong	13
1	do n't buy this here it is selling for 49 99 at best buy \( bestbuy com \) wait until they lower the price on amazon	13
1	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13
1	i rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and could n't get past it do n't waste your time or patience with this annoying game	13
1	pointless quests with no real conclusions ctd every 30 45 minutes lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment all in all a very unpolished product even with the patch if your favorite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game	13
1	such great visuals and i love most of the star wars rpg shooters but i cant believe this is a point and click game i was hoping kotor2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill the days of boulder 's gate point n click should be over but i guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay still a good game but dissapointed	13
1	lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey do not play on the xbox 360 you will experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product why \? the first was very good	13
1	i bought this game when it was 50 because i thought it would be a great game i was wrong you dont get a lightsabre until far into the game and all the advertisments shows you with a lightsabre the game is extremely buggy and has poor graphics i am a huge starwars fan and would not reccomend this game to anyone no matter how big of a starwars fan they are dont buy this game	13
1	i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here 's an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children 's word game book i easily got all of them except 1 meaning i could n't progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i did n't want to ! i'm not saying it 's a bad game it 's just probably not a good game for grownups	13
1	dvd 's which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or do n't play when i try to play them on the xbox do n't waste your money on this buy a stand alone dvd player instead so you wo n't have the frustration that i 've had	13
1	this remote is of awful quality i 've been through two of them in the past year i would n't complain so much if it did n't cost 30 ! it 's worth ten at most most people would be better off buying a cheap dvd player rather than using the xbox	13
1	seems like they just huried this game too much running around to get answers the phone did not even have web acsess actually i did not like it at all	13
1	my daughter and i have played all of the previous games we 've enjoyed them overall some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun this game was quite lame in comparison to the others the puzzles were n't really puzzling just boring tasks there were not many clues to find because there were n't many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything the game ended abruptly and was very short we did not use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge we did like the newness of becoming frank and joe hardy occasionally the rest was pretty boring if you are looking for a nancy drew game try one of the others instead	13
1	the review by bovey is spot on ! these games have gotten more boring as they go the majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough \? there was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom ! and the game was so short suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed in what these games have become i loved the final scene i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough this game was just lame i do n't recommend paying full price for it	13
1	both this game and danger by design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games \( shadow ranch the last train to blue moon canyon secret of the old clock etc \) the game was short and i thought the tasks were a bit dull i also found it somewhat confusing switching between nancy drew and the hardy boys hopefully her interactive will produce something better next time because these games really are addictive even for adults	13
1	i love the idea behind this game and it 's pretty impressively exectuted i had three gripes though 1 \) it 's so fast paced that i found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 \) i could n't get the magnify and reduce \( with quick little circles \) to work this caused me great frustration 3 \) there 's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times i quit playing it pretty quickly	13
1	this game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people	13
1	i am a huge fan of the rpg genre and have played just about every one for the pc morrowind is the most boring one i have ever played i turned it off after two evenings of slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with npcs and lamely fighting rats the interface is terrible you are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you ca n't even carry your treasure back to town this game was all work with no fun do not buy	13
1	there are pros and cons of this card pros its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordablecons games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save ! sometimes crashes i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car	13
1	i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out i got so far and couldnt get any further this was a waste of my money if i could sell it i would i like the regular clue better that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one when i seen it wasnt i thought this might be fun but as i was playing it i hated it more and more i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else i hate i	13
1	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
1	after playing this game for the third time i had a thought 'why did i buy this ! ' this game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly i cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other nba street 's save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game	13
1	poor quality out of box you can only play kq7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is	13
1	i brought this after having played caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and i thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension wrong this is a bad rip off of caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that i was playing the same game but with less involvement or control this is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they 'll stay caesar iv that 's what you 're wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it is n't feel like i 've wasted my money	13
1	the games faults have been well covered already so i 'll just say if a roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for ceasar iv afer playing the demo i can say that this will be a far superior game than civcity on every level it seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably	13
1	like the other reviews i find this game a rip off of caesare iii \( i did n't know there was a iv ! must look into that \) while the graphics are admirable the gameplay was n't challenging at all it did n't take me any time at all to win and i'm one of the worst game players ever otoh it 's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals do n't buy it now wait until it 's cheap like 9 95 or something	13
1	the controls are very difficult and i understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to everything i'm a long time gamer and i can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme plus for all the people talking about immersion i just do n't see it i just could n't get myself to care about the world or story i was in it did n't grab me like some games do	13
1	bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but i was very dissapointed with it clunky control system really put me off	13
1	now before you say anything i have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster \( grudgingly playing it though \) and now for the unbaiased opinion i think that this game is so completely stupid it and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion	13
1	i really could not tell you anything as i still have not recieved this game despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago	13
1	hi it was impossible to use this product because the keythey gave me did n't work imight make a fisbee out of the dvd ! jerr	13
1	i have a pretty decent computer \( athlon64 3000 radeon x550 \) but this game does not work at all even after i download and install the patch from aspyr \( though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box \) spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the cpu until i kill the process aspyr support is unable to help that said despite other reviews here this game does not install starforce but maybe that 's why my version wo n't work	13
1	this game is just the original a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at all ! ! i hate this game so much ! ! it is literally the worst dbz game i have ever played and i have played them all \) i advise you if ur looking for a new dbz game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system do not buy this game ever ! ! ! !	13
1	i have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on this action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in avoid like the plague	13
1	i bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a usb flash drive i have not been able to get either to work correctly after following their instructions on the datel website on how to update the codes using a usb drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card it also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 i have had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow and does n't live up to the promises their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves ! !	13
1	i honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms 4 came out it actually now has a use let me explain unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing \( the company that translated wild arms 4 \) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you 'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this if it was n't for this reason i would n't even be interested in this product	13
1	then this will not work on your console but if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console if you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark	13
1	as far as i am concerned this game is total garbage and i would not recomend it to any one i do not know why it was ever released ! ! deer hunter 2003 is the same way i tossed both of them in the garbage trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story the game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers	13
1	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
1	first of all it 's sad that someone would put out a product \( the 360 \) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans second i attached this i plugged it in it would n't even turn on waste of money do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it	13
1	stay away from this product my intercooler while noisy as all hell worked for a good 3 months but i continously got random red circles of death until my 360 got another one today and couldnt recover this product will mess up your 360 because of the way the power cord has to go through it first terrible product that cost me 140 and a whole month without my xbox while i wait for it to be repaired	13
1	the intercooler can and in my case did damage my 360 it sucks current that otherwise would go to the 360 which caused component failure the worst part \? as it 's not an approved accessory for the 360 any damage it causes will void your warranty and you 'll have to buy a new 360 out of pocket	13
1	i was not able to get the original intercooler to work on my system i sent it back and got another one the second intercooler did not work either it makes a nice paperweight !	13
1	i played this game until chapter 23 all the dancing levels were very hard to beat ! i think this game is not worth buying rent it	13
1	this game is a joke ! it is immpossible for a child to get past level 3 it took my husband about 20 tries to get past it and he is a pro at video games \( he beat mech 2 for x box and halo2 the third time he played them \) do n't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out it is was a waste of money my kids wo n't even play it it should be rated n for nobody	13
1	the gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun ! the kids did n't even like it run do n't walk away from this dentist office of a game jaws cr p \( jaws just another w smith	13
1	my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i	13
1	we have been unsuccessful with this e reader attachment since we purchased it cards read once and never again does n't matter if we use the gb sp or advance still does n't do anything do n't recommend you waste your money	13
1	it 's got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might have had the good unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving the bad some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story	13
1	i purchased this game when it was new and my computer while meeting the requirements just could n't run it i put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again the computer i have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work i contacted tech support and got what i am now sure are just something for me to try until i quit trying and leave them alone it worked they win they got my money and i got jack	13
1	the copy of simcity4 that i purchased came without the access codes to support instillation when i called electronic arts all i got was an automated phone system press 2 now ea 's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes ! i could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem the automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code ! i have returned the game to amazon for a refund i would never buy another ea product	13
1	i bought one of these for my daughter as a gift found that i need one for each gba or sp so i bought another one for my son then after we could n't get them to work consulted nintendo we found that the wireless adapter does n't work for all multi player games there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version some gift	13
1	at first when i got it it seemed fun then as the minutes go by it got boring quick the missions suck the bosses are too hard i just sold my game if you buy this game you 'll be doing the sam	13
1	i really liked the first two jak games so i was excited to try jak 3 whoa major mistake this game is nothing more than a lame racing wannabe i was very disappointed in this game if you are expecting a platformer look elsewhere	13
1	my son \( 7 \) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday it came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play we kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient we do n't do much pc gaming but we have a fairly new dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient if the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we would n't have wasted his time we have yet to receive credit for this item a huge hassle ! ! we 'll stick to the ps2 games from now on	13
1	i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one what happened ! ! this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game	13
1	well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades i could n't get the video to work at all could n't get technical support at all and i gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	13
1	first thing the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 caesar games out there having said that this game had a major bug right at the release how is that possible \? is it unreasonable to expect a u s company to produce a flawless product \? probably not but tilted mill has some of the the best pros in the industry basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess the advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer far better to go with civcity 3	13
1	this one turned out badly and i hate to say i bought it buggy worse than normal it is a rough game the fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible the support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions too bad i trusted pc gamer 's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game	13
1	she is just right for me i know im a little to hot for her but i think wed make hollywoods cuttist couple	13
1	please sid with the dissapointment of civiv and now railroads say you have n't jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers sid the reason we purchase these games is because your name is on them this game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who 's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards you created after this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account	13
1	i waited months for this game to come out i ca n't add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever	13
1	sid meier 's reputation was unblemished after the civil war series civilization and the original releases of railroad tycoon but this game release is a major setback that will make me hesitate about any future products carrying his name this is a major derailment it is the fastest that i have ever firmly known that a new game was being removed from my hard drive take a look at how many used copies are already flooding the market and this game just released less than two weeks ago every aspect is made into chewing gum where you were used to having steak there is no expansion tweak or update that can fix how seriously dumbed down this version is	13
1	ok most people have more then one system i have a ps2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the ps2 \? some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don	13
1	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	13
1	this extension cable did not work with my standard microsoft s controller unless you still use the old monster sized xbox controller these cables are worthless	13
1	this game was originally released for 10 dollars almost everything about it is pulled straight from diablo and is not quite as good though this game has a few things about it that are interesting and can be enjoyable to some people i would just skip this game and go for diablo 2	13
1	tediously long and weary nothing interesting just a lot of borrowed ideas from rtcw hl2 etc i am sick of this	13
1	beautiful graphics and nice storyline but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful ! not to mention the monsters level up with you so you 'll never be at an advantage you could pretty much beat the game at level 5	13
1	i bought this adaptor because my kids and i have both the nintendo ds and ds lite it works great on the original ds but the thing that 's supposed to fit into the ds lite is too wide if you 're looking for an adaptor for just the regular ds this one works great if for the ds lite do n't waste your money	13
1	i bought the piece of junk from amazon and i regret the day i started using amazon the machine did not work and the customer service of amazon was the worst i have ever experienced i will never ever shop amazon again	13
1	i do n't even have to explain the worst bait and switch tatic i have ever seen horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible horrible amazon bait and switch i will never shop on amazon again	13
1	as was said in a earlier review the creators of final fantasy are giving us everything but what we actually asked for they gave us advent children cell phone games and finally dirge of cerberus this game is an action based game showing you a day in the life of the most under used and least interesting character in the final fantasy series its the creators way of telling us that they will never re make final fantasy vii but will rather insult us with every marketing ploy know to man	13
1	if you need a remote to turn on the tele and run the 360 this will do but it wo n't operate a dvr dvd vcr or cable box if you 're really keen on it i 'll sell you mine	13
1	try before you buy ! this game has a major glitch its save game files are erased sometimes so you can start all over again beware	13
1	why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can \? these memory cards are way over priced i love ps2 it 's one of the best systems i have ever played and owned but this memory card stuff is a scam i already own 2 cards and i need more	13
1	i bought the piece of junk from amazon and i regret the day i started using amazon the machine did not work and the customer service of amazon was the worst i have ever experienced i will never ever shop amazon again	13
1	if you are looking for an xbox vertsion of another chapter in mechwarrior series this isn't it this is an extemely dumbed down version of mw even if you \( mechwarrior fans \) forget about having no customization remember this you can only fire one weapon at at time you have to cycle between lazers cannons and rockets i was bored after about 5 minutes again people who never played mw series may like this game better	13
1	i hate this game its the worst game i 've ever played	13
1	every year there has to be a game adapted from a classic movie or based on a classic movie \( from russia with love which is actually not a bad game \) recentlty just landing my hands on a copy of this i simply could n't resist picking up scarface the world is yours i loved the movie scar face and i was gonna love this but it turns out i did n't the controls are really a joke instead of your normal fps 3ps rpg etcetera there are really bland controls you ca n't even tell what to do the dialouge is corny and everything else is a joke for die hard fans only i guess	13
1	my nephew really needed a new controller so i ordered this along with a game for his birthday the game was received fine but he never received the controller i finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on amazon the delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by amazon so the 1 star is for the service the delay and the lack of full explanation who knows the controller could have been wonderful \? \?	13
1	you get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot with all of the free stuff out there to download for the sims the stuff pack is not very worth it maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny	13
1	i noticed there were not many new items in this game i found this the advertising for this game to be deceiving this expansion ws not worth the money	13
1	this pack offered very little of anything the decor \( very little of it \) is uninspired i was hoping to get some good artwork at least i know a lot of people do n't like to download from fan sites but do n't waste your money on this junk believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did this is the first and last stuff pack that i will ever buy	13
1	i bought this game 5 days ago and when i finally got it it was missing a pice of plastic in the middle so that i could not play the game and the case was also damage	13
1	when i first played this game i got bored in 10 minutes all you do is shoot and kill people for nothing have the police chase you and you shoot them bring girls into your car and do it with them i dont recommend this game at all its overrated	13
1	nothing more really needs to be said i'm running a 3ghz p4 256mb ati radeon 9000 series pci express video card and 2gb of ram and the game still hangs lags and locks up on my computer i tried uninstalling reinstalling same effect do not buy this gam	13
1	the overall impression is that of a game made on the rush assuming the good alignment you win simply by building expensive buildings at the edge of your influence zone and burning the enemy 's platoons sent by a very unintelligent ai since winning requires no strategy the game is challenging you can do basically the same on all levels the races against which one fights are pretty much the same except for their skins and the building 's aspect defeating them all takes you at most 8 hours of gameplay unlike the previous version of b w there are no custom campaigns nor multiplayer features cinematics and creature apart it looks like a very primitive first version of age of empires	13
1	all i have to say is this game is not for 'everyone' ! ! you have to be able to read to play ! last time i checked not everyone can read i bought this for my 13 year old son who has autisum he can master just about every game i get him but he ca n't read so for him this game was not much fun i ended up playing more than he did and i did n't even enjoy it	13
1	with games such as grand theft auto san andreas driv3r true crime etc the competition is fierce and a game like this wo n't cut it first when max talks it sounds like he is mumbling second the graphics suck third the game just sucks in general i am so glad i got this used for 6 i bet it was returned because it was too dumb for the previous owner i saw it at eb games for only 5 that must mean it sucks and i read rockstar game the rights to remedy because the sales for the sequel max payne 2 were so low i have no clue how this was made a greatest hit play gta or true crime instea	13
1	i had high hopes on this game but i was disapointed the controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90 was bad the story line was basically typical it really did n't hold my interest for long i did beat the game because i spent 50 on it the day it came out and i figured i would at least do that i gave the game to a friend of mine after i beat it and he had the same opinion as i did it 's worth renting but definately not worth buying hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	13
1	this game is really bad i mean everything about it they took so long to make this and for what its just a waste off time and your money i gave it 1star because the guns are the best thing about this crap gam	13
1	being a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this the graphics are quot cartoon quot horrible and the need for quot vr quot points becomes annoying after awhile the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that 's with playing with a ps2 gun \( i ca n't imagine shooting with a controller \) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on quot vr quot points the dialog gets annoying too and you ca n't skip hearing it either	13
1	this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy does n't respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just do n't play the pc version borrow someone 's xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	13
1	i thougt there would be a better story line and what i found was very disappointing the boss \( mcgruder \) was easier to beat than the boss in the matrix path to neo i mean i paid good money for this game on the premise that it was a quality game obviously i was wrong	13
1	i plugged the receiver into my game controller and followed the directions to get the controller to communicate with the receiver the receiver light kept blinking which means that it did n't recognize the controller after several tries i decided that the product is defective and returned it	13
1	this just sucks the main person just keeps running around he just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board no fwd bike control he wo n't peddle but gos backwards quite well tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked atleast i bought it used and for not much money maybe ill find a fix and try it again later	13
1	i rented this game for my 3 year old who loves the movie he tried to play it he like it i tried to play it got to the dancing part i could n't get past it i tried for 5 days my rental time was up i returned it i have n't rented it since this game is way too hard to beat and my 3 year old got bored with it real fast i would not recommend this game to anyone do n't waste your money buying it unless you are an expert with video games i'm just thankful that i rented it instead of buying it	13
1	i rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and could n't get past it do n't waste your time or patience with this annoying game	13
1	pointless quests with no real conclusions ctd every 30 45 minutes lengthy dialoge with no real human attachment all in all a very unpolished product even with the patch if your favorite aspect of the first game was the story then do not buy this game	13
1	such great visuals and i love most of the star wars rpg shooters but i cant believe this is a point and click game i was hoping kotor2 would have implimented a normal battle engagement theres nothing worse than toggling thru menus etc during an intense battle and actually having to turn around click the target then engage someone else after the kill the days of boulder 's gate point n click should be over but i guess theres a crowd for this type of gameplay still a good game but dissapointed	13
1	lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey do not play on the xbox 360 you will experience random sound shreiks resolution issues too lonng load times and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product why \? the first was very good	13
1	i bought this game when it was 50 because i thought it would be a great game i was wrong you dont get a lightsabre until far into the game and all the advertisments shows you with a lightsabre the game is extremely buggy and has poor graphics i am a huge starwars fan and would not reccomend this game to anyone no matter how big of a starwars fan they are dont buy this game	13
1	i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here 's an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children 's word game book i easily got all of them except 1 meaning i could n't progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i did n't want to ! i'm not saying it 's a bad game it 's just probably not a good game for grownups	13
1	dvd 's which play perfectly well on other cheap players freeze skip or do n't play when i try to play them on the xbox do n't waste your money on this buy a stand alone dvd player instead so you wo n't have the frustration that i 've had	13
1	this remote is of awful quality i 've been through two of them in the past year i would n't complain so much if it did n't cost 30 ! it 's worth ten at most most people would be better off buying a cheap dvd player rather than using the xbox	13
1	seems like they just huried this game too much running around to get answers the phone did not even have web acsess actually i did not like it at all	13
1	my daughter and i have played all of the previous games we 've enjoyed them overall some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun this game was quite lame in comparison to the others the puzzles were n't really puzzling just boring tasks there were not many clues to find because there were n't many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything the game ended abruptly and was very short we did not use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge we did like the newness of becoming frank and joe hardy occasionally the rest was pretty boring if you are looking for a nancy drew game try one of the others instead	13
1	the review by bovey is spot on ! these games have gotten more boring as they go the majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over how much is enough \? there was no real sense of scariness or danger just boredom ! and the game was so short suddenly it ended ! i am so disappointed in what these games have become i loved the final scene i even liked blackmoor manor even though i could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough this game was just lame i do n't recommend paying full price for it	13
1	i love the idea behind this game and it 's pretty impressively exectuted i had three gripes though 1 \) it 's so fast paced that i found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure 2 \) i could n't get the magnify and reduce \( with quick little circles \) to work this caused me great frustration 3 \) there 's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times i quit playing it pretty quickly	13
1	this game is fun and injoyable but the bonus levels are questionable and it is almost better with less people	13
1	this is supposed to be an x box cleaner but the system does not read the disc a shoddy product	13
1	i am a huge fan of the rpg genre and have played just about every one for the pc morrowind is the most boring one i have ever played i turned it off after two evenings of slowly walking around having stupid repetitive conversations with npcs and lamely fighting rats the interface is terrible you are very limited in what you can carry so after you kill a monster you ca n't even carry your treasure back to town this game was all work with no fun do not buy	13
1	there are pros and cons of this card pros its stores a lot of memoryable to save many files at one timecompactaffordablecons games that require 256 blocks will not be able to save ! sometimes crashes i tried saving with nhl 06 and it said it needed more memory if you have a game that used 256 blocks get the gameshark 16x memory car	13
1	i got this game during the summer expecting it to be great fun well it caught my interest for a few weeks then i just got bored with it i 'd only recomend it to people who do not get bored easily	13
1	i didnt like clue chronicles i sat there for 5 hours and still couldnt figure it out i got so far and couldnt get any further this was a waste of my money if i could sell it i would i like the regular clue better that is why i bought this i thought it was something like the old one when i seen it wasnt i thought this might be fun but as i was playing it i hated it more and more i have sat down and tried this game 10 different times and i end up in the same spot and cant get no where else i hate i	13
1	we recommend not buying this game unless you do n't mind a buggy version that is not supported by hasbro and ca n't be fixed hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available save your money and wait for the next one hopefully bug free	13
1	after playing this game for the third time i had a thought 'why did i buy this ! ' this game is extremely unoriginal and gets boring very quickly i cannot notice any difference and improvements from the first ballers and other nba street 's save your money and do not purchase this dreadful game	13
1	should n't you people know by now \? say it with me never buy movie games a friend of mine bought it and it was horrible it was way too easy to die in etc etc etc hey listen keep you money your investment is n't in here	13
1	the vertical stand is wonderfull but why \? you can do this with 2 useless dvd cases and some duck tape i put my ps slim vertically and it helps but why waste the time buying the product \? i bought it just for kicks literally	13
1	poor quality out of box you can only play kq7 almost useless very dispointed that they even sell this game as it is	13
1	we got this game free in a box of corn chex we thought oh this will be fun since the show is cool so we got home and played it and it was so annoying ! there 's just like a black screen before and after the question shows up and a black background just do n't buy it if you want to have any fun	13
1	i am extreamly dissapointd with this game every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location there is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings	13
1	i brought this after having played caesar3 and loved it but wanted something with a bit more scope for controlling dynamics of a city and i thought being a civcity game this would offer me the extension wrong this is a bad rip off of caesar3 sure graphics are more advanced with the zoom in view but other than that i was playing the same game but with less involvement or control this is a sit back and let it happen to you game keep the people happy and build everything and they 'll stay caesar iv that 's what you 're wanting it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it is n't feel like i 've wasted my money	13
1	the games faults have been well covered already so i 'll just say if a roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for ceasar iv afer playing the demo i can say that this will be a far superior game than civcity on every level it seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably	13
1	like the other reviews i find this game a rip off of caesare iii \( i did n't know there was a iv ! must look into that \) while the graphics are admirable the gameplay was n't challenging at all it did n't take me any time at all to win and i'm one of the worst game players ever otoh it 's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals do n't buy it now wait until it 's cheap like 9 95 or something	13
1	the controls are very difficult and i understand they wanted realism but they killed a lot of fun by making you just so damned vulnerable to everything i'm a long time gamer and i can handle a tough game but this is just frustrating to the extreme plus for all the people talking about immersion i just do n't see it i just could n't get myself to care about the world or story i was in it did n't grab me like some games do	13
1	bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but i was very dissapointed with it clunky control system really put me off	13
1	now before you say anything i have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster \( grudgingly playing it though \) and now for the unbaiased opinion i think that this game is so completely stupid it and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion	13
1	i really could not tell you anything as i still have not recieved this game despite having paid for it over a month and a half ago	13
1	hi it was impossible to use this product because the keythey gave me did n't work imight make a fisbee out of the dvd ! jerr	13
1	i have a pretty decent computer \( athlon64 3000 radeon x550 \) but this game does not work at all even after i download and install the patch from aspyr \( though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box \) spellforce exe just sits there and sucks up 99 of the cpu until i kill the process aspyr support is unable to help that said despite other reviews here this game does not install starforce but maybe that 's why my version wo n't work	13
1	i gave it one star because there was no way to give it less this game when played on the x box was great so when it came out for pc i bought it big mistake ! the control are too hard to learn and when you are in a battle you ca n't stop to think which keys when used together work there are too many keys that you need to push together to do even the simplest thing i wasted my money on this game i deleted it and will never play it do n't waste your money	13
1	this game is just the original a crappy beam system where you spin to the right when you lock beams and the gamplay is totally repetitive also their isnt any in game transforming at all ! ! i hate this game so much ! ! it is literally the worst dbz game i have ever played and i have played them all \) i advise you if ur looking for a new dbz game wait for the next one because their shure isnt anything new here but a crappy beam system do not buy this game ever ! ! ! !	13
1	this is by far the worst instance of overzealous copy protection i 've ever experienced i bought this game new at a local store because i 've been itching to play simcity 4 but that game will not work with my new video card got this game home and it installed just fine but when it came time to launch the game it said disc authentication failed tried it with the other disc failed again went to the company 's support forums and found a lot of other people with the same problem and no one had done anything to help them thankfully the people at the store were very reasonable and gave me a full refund	13
1	do n't buy it unless you want the starforce malware on your computer i understand publishers wanting to prevent piracy but not at the expense of replacing the drivers i need \( ed \) for my dvd burner check the search engines and see for yourself would have otherwise been a great game too bad it is n't playable because of this malware	13
1	starforce nothing else need be said starforce singlehandly has destroyed a number of could be great games i do n't know since not a single one will play on a dell xps gaming laptop	13
1	this game sucks it tries to be sim city with extra features unfortunately the graphics are way below average in fact some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student the interface is clumsy and not intuitive i am a big fan of the sim city series and this game really falls short	13
1	this game has starforce copy protection which is software that you do not want on your computer reportedly it replaces your cd and or dvd drivers and often causes extreme hardware and software problems i 've been a victim of the software problems it basically crippled my very expensive scsi scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it it could be the best game that 's ever been produced but anyone who 's had the starforce experience is going to steer clear	13
1	i have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on this action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in avoid like the plague	13
1	i bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a usb flash drive i have not been able to get either to work correctly after following their instructions on the datel website on how to update the codes using a usb drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card it also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2 i have had nothing but trouble with it it 's slow and does n't live up to the promises their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves ! !	13
1	i honestly do not like cheat devices but since wild arms 4 came out it actually now has a use let me explain unfortunately thanks to an programming on the part of xseed puplishing \( the company that translated wild arms 4 \) it is impossible to unlock two of the bonus contents in the game without the aid of this device or a similar device like a gameshark since this is the cheapest of all said devices if you are hellbent on unlocking everything in that game you 'll want to shell out the twenty dollars for this if it was n't for this reason i would n't even be interested in this product	13
1	then this will not work on your console but if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console if you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark	13
1	i purchased this remote control to make watching dvd 's on the ps2 easier i had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box i had to press most of the buttons very hard to get them to work i hoped it would get better but it only got worse i am now back to using the game controler and threw the remote control away i would never recommend this product	13
1	as far as i am concerned this game is total garbage and i would not recomend it to any one i do not know why it was ever released ! ! deer hunter 2003 is the same way i tossed both of them in the garbage trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story the game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers	13
1	this intercooler will ruin your 360 with prolonged use i was getting error 68 codes and could n't figure out why turns out it was the intercooler sucking too much power from the 360 do not buy this product	13
1	i had this in my cart and just thought it sounded like a useful tool to protect my investment i cannot thank all of you who were honest and told me what damage this could do thank you all again ! mckinle	13
1	this product was not designed by the 360 team and really most products that are n't are n't very good for your 360 this is no exception it can and has been known to actually damage and destroy your 360 a statement from an 360 representative is to not but this product it has caused numerous problems for a lot of people mainly because it actually draws power from the 360 and that 's not good and leads to a lot of other problems	13
1	my xbox was getting the red rings of death figured this was most likely due to overheating so i bought this thing not only did it not fix any of my troubles i was having more whenever i would bump my xbox the whole thing would shut off instantly found this out by accident come to find out this thing has very bad connections so for 20 you can buy more headaches than microsoft is pawning off onto us game addicts	13
1	this is the worst item you can get for your 360 i got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360 it was crashing and freezing and ultimately i had to get my console repaired do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby \( 360 \)	13
1	i bought this for my xbox 360 and it does n't work at all which is a good thing considering the other reviews i 've read here at least by not working it is n't damaging my xbox 360	13
1	i bought this from best buy yfor 25 dollars thinking it would give my xbox360 a longer life and keep it 's insides cool when i plugged it in my xbox360 did n't turn on at all after trying it several times i took it off and plugged in the ac adapter back on to my xbox for a while the xbx would n't turn on i thought it was broken i gave a it a few minutes and luckily it turned back on but that intercooler nearly broke my xbox don t buy it	13
1	first of all it 's sad that someone would put out a product \( the 360 \) that gets so hot that it tends to fry itself unless you spend another 10 of the product cost on a little series of fans second i attached this i plugged it in it would n't even turn on waste of money do yourself a favor and just keep your machine in an open uncluttered unblocked area if you absolutely must provide additional airflow just point a 10 clip on fan at it	13
1	i played this game until chapter 23 all the dancing levels were very hard to beat ! i think this game is not worth buying rent it	13
1	this game is a joke ! it is immpossible for a child to get past level 3 it took my husband about 20 tries to get past it and he is a pro at video games \( he beat mech 2 for x box and halo2 the third time he played them \) do n't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out it is was a waste of money my kids wo n't even play it it should be rated n for nobody	13
1	the gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un fun ! the kids did n't even like it run do n't walk away from this dentist office of a game jaws cr p \( jaws just another w smith	13
1	my kid played the game for 5 min only it is not fun if you want to try it just rent i	13
1	it 's got some occasionally interesting puzzles but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal keepsake might have had the good unique and challenging puzzles handy hint system helps keep the game moving the bad some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear blurry low res backgrounds dull characters and an uninteresting story	13
1	i bought the kr party bundle for my boyfriend 's daughter for her birthday she loves the game but it has only been about two weeks and the mic is dead it started with the static for a while but then while i was singing it just died completely i know i'm not a great singer but i'm not that bad	13
1	i bought this mic in december and after only two nights of singing it completely died ! what a complete disappointment save your money !	13
1	this game is simply put not good i got bored to tears playing it then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk it is slow paced predictable and not suspenseful at all in fact these characteristics are probably why it 's so mainstream even though it 's laughable in comparison to real first person shooters which by the way do n't even belong on consoles owning at this game means you are an average player any true fps gamer knows what childish pathetic garbage this is while the rest just go with the hype many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it 's worth anything at all it is n't	13
1	i used to love this game but there are so many better games out there plus this game is overated with a not so good storyline and nerdy weapons it 's just not good	13
1	i purchased this game when it was new and my computer while meeting the requirements just could n't run it i put he game in a box and just a month ago found it again the computer i have now should be able to run the game thrice simultaneously with all options on highest settings yet the game will randomly crash and cause my computer to restart and losing my 4mins to 2 hours work i contacted tech support and got what i am now sure are just something for me to try until i quit trying and leave them alone it worked they win they got my money and i got jack	13
1	the copy of simcity4 that i purchased came without the access codes to support instillation when i called electronic arts all i got was an automated phone system press 2 now ea 's manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes ! i could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem the automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code ! i have returned the game to amazon for a refund i would never buy another ea product	13
1	i bought one of these for my daughter as a gift found that i need one for each gba or sp so i bought another one for my son then after we could n't get them to work consulted nintendo we found that the wireless adapter does n't work for all multi player games there are only a few games that will work with the wireless version some gift	13
1	not as much fun as i remember maybe better if they had a better selection of games \( one on one hardball etc	13
1	i purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting however what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset the screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons what was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	13
1	i was really excited when i saw this item was out ! i had the commodore 64 when i was a kid and my brother and i used to spend hours and hours playing games on it i was so glad to see that winter games and summer games was included until the item arrived and i plugged it in and tried to play with it the joystick does n't work at all when you move it to the right so you can only use it to go up down or left big dissapointment do n't waste your	13
1	do n't buy this it will crash your entire xbox learn to play forget the cheats	13
1	if you are looking for codes like game shark had this is not for you not only do you have to have a computer if anything happens to the disk you are screwed you wo n't be able reinstall windows or install it on a new computer some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for 100 completion so if those are they games you plan on using this is the best thing out there	13
1	returned item for refund found it cheaper at toys r u	13
1	small memory which means that u can only put 1 save on it so u have to run back to your comp everytime u wanna save ! ! ! and software is veery confusing ! ! ! horrible buy ! ! ! i returned the piece of junk ! !	13
1	i dont have much to say other than i did not like this game i was hoping that it was going to be like fusion frenzy for the xbox but it was not nearly as fun the controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good some people may like it but i did n't	13
1	at first when i got it it seemed fun then as the minutes go by it got boring quick the missions suck the bosses are too hard i just sold my game if you buy this game you 'll be doing the sam	13
1	i really liked the first two jak games so i was excited to try jak 3 whoa major mistake this game is nothing more than a lame racing wannabe i was very disappointed in this game if you are expecting a platformer look elsewhere	13
1	this is a perfect example of false advertisement if you 're like the many that i 've heard of trying to order a remote for the playstation 2 do n't order this one unless you have a newer model the picture shows an ir unit but it does n't come with one so save yourself the hassle and do n't order this	13
1	my son \( 7 \) used a gift certificate to purchase this game for his birthday it came with 4 dics that we downloaded correctly but the game would not play we kept getting an error message that our graphics were not sufficient we do n't do much pc gaming but we have a fairly new dell laptop computer that we assumed was sufficient if the item description had been more advising that certain requirements would prevent the game from working we would n't have wasted his time we have yet to receive credit for this item a huge hassle ! ! we 'll stick to the ps2 games from now on	13
1	i saw a dvd player at target for 30 yesterday i especially do n't see the need for the xbox 360 remote if it 's 40 ! ! space saving maybe \? \? \?	13
1	my only experience with this product was after i opened it and started to play a dvd in my xbox when i tried to pause it it did n't work and it had brand new batteries i found \( after much frustration \) that if i smacked it against my hand a few times then it would work for about 2 minutes i took it back to exchange for another in hopes that it was just a bad unit but it was sold out so i just got my money back you can buy a dvd player for not much more than this way overpriced piece of junk costs	13
1	do not use thisthe dvd thing causes the xbox to break when u play games the disk doesnt constantly spin it reads some and takes break so it doesnt over heat when it reads a dvd it must constantly spin the dvd playback kit fryed my xbox at most best buy s you can buy a dvdplayer that functions better for less money than the one for xbox	13
1	i would blame this game sucking on the wii it is unfortunate that the sequel to cod2 had to be this game i played it on the x box 360 and it was n't good there either i was only able to stand playing the game for about an hour after that i could n't bring myself to touch it again	13
1	i am a huge spyro fan i have been playing since the first one which was great the second one better the third one ok forth one what happened ! ! this one after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating you never seem to get anywhere all the voices have changed if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games dont buy this and dont be disapointed however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game	13
1	i have n't even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my ps2 after the ps2 logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens i thought it was maybe just that disc but i exchanged it and the same thing happened i called ubisoft and they said many people with the slim ps2 have called to say it does n't work but they do n't have any answers sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many ps2 's do not buy if you do n't want the risk of it not working ! ! ! !	13
1	ok let me break itdown for you the game is n't all thatb great infact it sucks on ice but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year really you really ca n't blame them that made this game the fact is 2006 is one of the worst years there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great we see about 90 of games and movies arent doing that good so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the ps3 and the wii comes out i promise you that year want disoponte so dont buy every thing in 06 wait till 07 dont waiste your mone	13
1	this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about 16 or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it 's just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it	13
1	well it sounds like a great game but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades i could n't get the video to work at all could n't get technical support at all and i gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions	13
1	first thing the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 caesar games out there having said that this game had a major bug right at the release how is that possible \? is it unreasonable to expect a u s company to produce a flawless product \? probably not but tilted mill has some of the the best pros in the industry basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess the advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer far better to go with civcity 3	13
1	this one turned out badly and i hate to say i bought it buggy worse than normal it is a rough game the fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible the support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions too bad i trusted pc gamer 's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers do not buy this game even when working it is not but a bargain bin game	13
1	please sid with the dissapointment of civiv and now railroads say you have n't jumped on the easy bandwagon like so many other game designers sid the reason we purchase these games is because your name is on them this game seems like it was made for a 12 year old not someone who 's grown up with the complexities you normally build into your games please the next game you release make sure it lives up to the standards you created after this just throwing your name on a game no longer means you will print some money for your bank account	13
1	i waited months for this game to come out i ca n't add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever	13
1	people i do n't know what you see in this game it 's not really a bad game it 's just an average arcade shooter more often than not i ca n't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly i pop out from behind something and i'm dead meat pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good time crisis game	13
1	i 'd like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it does n't work on lcd televisions it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets	13
1	when i bought the xbox on 6 11 06 it came at a very good rate of time my son enjoyed it then as we returned from a vacation he turned it on and we saw smoke i do n't feel paying for an item at this price was fair to only have it for two months i ca n't say the person that sold me the xbox has even tried to email me since i 've emailed him hmmmm	13
1	this game is horrible i rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it i had wasted 5 bucks its patheticic you cant do anything graphics are horrble cutscenes are as long as some commercials and the characters are gay pros sunny can bite yaycons horrbiel graphicsonly 3 playable charactersbad humorshort cutscenesu cant do anything1 path gamehardly 3d \( seriously it doesnt look like it	13
1	ok most people have more then one system i have a ps2 which plays copies and the 360 hmmmmmmmmmm should i pay so much money for the 360 version \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? or should i go for the free copy i can download for the ps2 \? some people might say better graphics hmmmmmmmmmm dont care and many don	13
1	seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there	13
0	i really liked this game im 14 years old and im in the high school but when im bored i seem to play this game all the time i dont why i would buy it if i were you ! ! ! very fun challenging at the same time !	13
0	i love this game my daughter and i are big ratchet and clank fans and look for games with similiar play we found that in the incredibles game it 's exciting and challenging as we get playing it i wonder if it is too easy at times but then i get to a spot that i ca n't accomplish until i do it 10 times my favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as mr incredible you then get to be mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun	13
0	this mic is very durable and is wired good have n't had any problems and is much better than the headset	13
0	if you 're going to play karaoke revolution this is the mic for you i now have 2 so that my wife and i can play in duet mode it 's much better than the headset for just 17 bucks you can have a 'real' mic that feels so much more natural if you play kr a lot invest in this microphone	13
0	i am so glad i purchased the logitech mic for ps2 the quality of the sound is awesome and my kids are having a blast with it the price is reasonable my kids take very good care of things but i'm not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment i will probably end up buying another one	13
0	it has some flaws you will have to run around a bit between play areas but it plays well enough the price is right and it is worth the time you will spend on it the learning curve is small and there are music sound tracks buried deep in the cd if you look for them \( a neat extra \) it has been around a couple of years and there is nothing new \( though you do have a quot partner quot you can exploint during battle \) but it is a good change of sceenary i liked it enough to want to finish it i think you will too	13
0	if you like diablo 1 this is exactly the same game only improved 300 percent if not for blizzards bnet and all the multiplayer options i would say that this game is also better than diablo	13
0	i'm not a big fan of the diablo d amp d typr game but this game is really neat the one big advantage of this game over diablo is the ability to control 2 characters in one game very high replay value also makes this game a winner pick up a copy if you can i 've seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store for the price you ca n't go wrong	13
0	i just recently bought this game for about 10 dollars i had always heard is was awsome but had never even played an xbox \( i 've been a ps2 fan for a while \) after i played the first couple of levels i was not dissapointed this game is simply amazing even today i ca n't possibly imagine how good it must have seemed back when it came out the gameplay is terrific and so are the graphics the sound and music to the game is awsome i highly recommend that this game is bought and not just rented because it is well worth owning	13
0	halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time this is definately a good game to play if you 've never played a first person shooter also if you have an xbox you should get this because it is awesome ratingsgraphics then 10 now 7sound 10replayability 6controls 10drawn in atmosphere 9fun 9multiplayer co op 9 multiplay	13
0	just so everyone knows i mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who would n't be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind and do n't even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this	13
0	this looked to be the new circuit board with flash ram and new modification options for the enthusiast the package was certainly new but the circuit board was the original version 1 you 'll need to go to great lengths to make sure you 're getting a version 2 if it 's possible at all good luck	13
0	brings back the good old days of playing these games after school	13
0	this is the game for race lovers awesome graphics car responce is just like the real thing photo lab is very nice too \( you can take pics of your rides \) you will never get bored of this game a must have	13
0	really it is a good game on war buy it since it \( he \) is very goo	13
0	used this product to softmod my xbox had to download an older version of the software though if you just use it to cheat in games probably not worth the money	13
0	can you use the action relpay on ur xbox for multiplayergames like on halo2 can u use codes their and make it so you get unlimited ammo because that is the only reason why i want to use this product is so that i can have unlimited ammo and not have to reload i would want invinsibility but then it would be obvious that i was cheatin and when u read that u probablly thought well its gonna look like ur cheating when ur guy doesnt have to reload and doesnt run out of ammo but still i would like to know this before i buy it i will probably end up buying it anyways to see wut this pup can do	13
0	yes i am a die hard star wars fan and yes i love a good mission based action game so man if this is n't the perfect game for me ! it 's so much fun and there 's so much freedom in the game in itself ! add on to that the space missions and wow this game totally blows me away ! highly recommended for anyone who is a star wars fan a fps fan or a fan of fun gameplay	13
0	i have been playing the madden series since i was a kid and this game is really good the games just keep getting better and better as each year passes everything in this game is worth the money i strongly reccommend it	13
0	it is a pretty fun game with a few quirks here and there some of them include the anoying click button interface and a few problems that are just a random guess to solve other than that it has very good graphics and a very addictive storyline	13
0	this game is a great one i enjoyed this game it is one of my favorites i recommend this game for anyone who enjoys final fantasy or a good rpg	13
0	this is perhaps the best of the final fantasy games and sadly the most under appreciated ix had amazing animation and backgrounds a beautiful music score and solid gameplay the characters are some of the most delightful in the series personally i think vivi and zidane are the coolest characters ever lastly the gorgeous cut scenes deliver a beautiful and epic storyline on a sidenote this game definitely deserves a remake there 's a lot of hype about final fantasy vii its own prequel and a remake coming for ps3 i feel that final fantasy ix should be remade on the ps3 i love the story line better than vii the graphics were way better and the gameplay was incredible	13
0	quick delivery product arrived on time and in excellent condition you have quality shipping thank yo	13
0	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
0	it was a great game that can include your whole family or entertain people at a party sometimes when you have a lot of people over you can even have a dance party overall its a great game and i recommend you buy it	13
0	if you already have an eye toy and your favorite game on it is beat freak then you have to get eye toy groove the 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music from elvis to good charlotte as a 46 year old woman i got this as an alternative of boring repetitive workout tapes with great success the game even has a calorie counter built in this is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids ages from 8 to 16 even the preschoolers i occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening which is more than i can say for dance dance revolution	13
0	i bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact i have n't heard any noise he is to busy playing it	13
0	this controller feels great in your hands in fact after using this controller for awhile my batteries went low and i had to switch back to the dualshock controller the dualshock felt wierd in my hands the response of the controller is good i have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time one down side to the controller was that i returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time i guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year	13
0	from using only two cordless controllers this one and the xbox 360 's controller i like this one a lot more it 's comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light i could n't ask for a better controller unless logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then i 'd find myself that much more pleased \) buy this one there is n't a better wireless controller out there	13
0	i came upon this game as a demo from sony i downloaded it onto my psp and was hooked within 5 minutes i needed to have the full game do n't let the child like voices and images steer you clear of this game if you are an older gamer trust me you will have some fun the only thing is i did beat it a little too fast still very fun	13
0	this controller is great you are able to play games much easier with this one than with the first manifest this controller should be considered better than the dual shock because it is more comfortable and for people like me who play games for long periods of time that is a plus	13
0	i 've played them all and enjoyed them all sorry this was the last one	13
0	i 've only had this controller for a few days and i have found that the layout is the same as the black controller i do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game	13
0	in case you havent' noticed this is a controller not a game so as far as the controller goes it works great and i have not had a single problem with it	13
0	it is not a false advertisement it is just meant for the newer models of the playstation 2 that have a built in ir receiver which is why it does n't include it	13
0	it works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original a v cables	13
0	this is a great cable for your hd tv while playing you sony playstation 2 it give very crisp and clear images much better than the cable that comes with the playstation	13
0	these component av cables make a world of difference in video quality especially on hdtv some images now appear pixelated this may be the game i am playing but everything else is smooth crisp and clear text is three times as easy to read i reccomend these for any hdtv owner	13
0	at first playing a star wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks ! ! ! ! ! this game is incredible ! ! ! it is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it buy this game and put your blasters on full	13
0	this is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play the addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title when you 're flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms you begin to realize this game is really special	13
0	this game is really good theres a wide varity of lvls to play and a very good multyplayer system the game only has a few faults like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship the game also gets a little boring after a while besides that its a great game	13
0	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
0	i bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing i didn't have any idea that it would be so fun that the whole family would join in and play for hours ! it was so fun that we immediately had to buy the kareoke cmt country game also	13
0	this game is great for when you have a group of friends come over it really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining i suggest this game for everybody	13
0	i bought this game for an adult birthday party it was a hit the game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game you have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc you can also change the mode to the traditional karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen it 's definitely for all ages even my two year old ca n't get enough of it the selection of music is good be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes	13
0	i do n't know how to extoll the praises of this game loudly enough we plugged it in on christmas morning and the entire family and friends have been playing it ever since the selection of songs is excellent the sing and dance feature brings sends this game way out in front of earlier editions \( which we also have \) the eye toy is a good addition just everything about it is first rate i ca n't think of a single drawback my only suggestion is that you purchase the game and make it an experience for the entire family parents too	13
0	rockstar games are rocking the gamers world one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games	13
0	i have all the grand theft games and this is one of my favs i highly recommend it and all the others i recently purchased liberty city awesome	13
0	the best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars ! ! if you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the internet then this is where the fun really begins ! these secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank \( this is only listing a few \) ! as always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old	13
0	this game was a new experience for me i did n't think i would like it but i did i like the story telling and it keeps you interested overall interesting fun and it will entertain you	13
0	i really really enjoyed this game it was the only game i played for almost 2 months i was so hooked on it my only criticism is that the missions are too rigid so the outcomes are very much the same during re play even if you make different choices i thought it was really neat that the character changes according to what you do e g too much eating and he gets fat	13
0	you can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric	13
0	first off the eyetoy is a great game peripheral next it 's getting some new games as well as it will be useable on the next gen console ps3 third it is usable as a webcam on the pc in fact it is a fantastic webcam only you need to download a inf \( a driver \) for the webcam there 's tutorials out there google it	13
0	you can read that the eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but i just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your pc by just plugging it into your computer 's usb port	13
0	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
0	we got a group of 5 friends together to do guitar hero 1 and 2 ddr and now karaoke revolution party it 's freaking cool the songs list is very good and there 's something for everyone easy to figure out too	13
0	the memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great no read errors very noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it	13
0	i love it that card my childrens have one for your own games	13
0	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
0	these are the best memory cards you can get for the ps2 only get this one or the sony playstation 2 1pk memory card rumors spread that non sony memory cards can damage your ps2 and lose saves on you memory cards	13
0	this game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay this game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is for example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them some a lot more complicating than others and theres os many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all so overall this game is great	13
0	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
0	back when it came out on xbox i was incredibly angry i only had a silly gameboy but when it came out for computer i just had to have it i found the game very fun to play simple controls \( use arrows not wasd \) and felt very fufilled as the credits finally rolled after the last battle it does n't take long to finish this game but play is continuous \( if you watch the entire credits \) and you can always start over and switch to evil good side for a new version of the game	13
0	right just so everyone knows i have never played this game however i think you should read this i bought fable and found that my computers graphics card was not compatible with it it is good enough but not supported so to avoid this i suggest checking the support section of the website before you buy to check that your card is compatible as they have actually put a list of cards on the site i assume that this problem is not uncommon so i advise you to check this before buying the game just thought you should know	13
0	i would be 5 on this one all the way because i enjoyed the game immensly \( the general idea of the game \) but because of personal preference i stopped playing it because of excessive gore sexual debasing themes and leud art if you like this game but do n't want all the questionable material \( yes i know that it 's nothing compared to other games \) then may i recommend fate by wildtangen	13
0	i do not own the headset yet but i have already ordered it from amazon and it is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so i will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes my impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous the price \? great price i got mine for somthing like 25 \( buy from abuy4u \) but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset yes 6 hours can last me a weekend	13
0	first things first there is a mute button on this unit if a user taps the power button the sound will mute on and off i'm guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either did n't read the instructions or could n't figure out a product with three buttons on it \( power mute volume up and volume down \) second this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a logitech wireless controller it works well and i noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular xbox communicator	13
0	pros 1 \) wireless2 \) small3 \) lightweight4 \) you can talk to your friends when you 're in the bathroom 5 \) it has a lot of noises to tell you it 's turning on and off and when the volume is at its max cons 1 \) cliking and poping noises2 \) my charger does n't connect to the headset without a rubber band 3 \) there is zero background noise cancellation for high pitched noises like my sister 4 \) have to charge it why ca n't it just have a fuel cell \? 5 \) no mute statis or indicator 6 \) it makes poping noises and a white nois	13
0	your back in liberty city \( just like gta 3 \) you cant fly swim clime \( just like gta 3 \) no graphics upgrade no airplanes glitches like crazy same as psp but if your looking for a game to just play and have fun and enjoy the intresting funny good story line than get this 20 bucks cant go wrong	13
0	this games story takes place before gta 3 so it 's sort of like a prequal set in liberty city compared to the original it looks a lot better plus they added bikes and motor cycles and attempted to improve the targeting by using the targeting system from san andreas i hate the targeting but being able target manually is a good thing if you do n't own a psp i 'd suggest getting this game but if you do and played it on that system there really is n't any point to buying this game unless you really really love gta	13
0	after my little brother lost my original copy i had to buy a new one and i am so glad i did i love the game and it was so much fun to play like all final fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay	13
0	if you liked final fantasy 3 you 'll like this game you 'll play some then learn some more of the story	13
0	i played this game with some friends out of town and seriously had to acquire a ps2 just to satisfy my craving not a shooter game not an rpg you just roll seriously it 's surprisingly awesome actually but my big disappointment came when after about 2 days of mildly committed playing it was done i 'd beat it and i'm really not a big gamer and i do n't know how much mileage i'm really gonna get out of the sort of limited 2 player mode maybe the sequel is better i hope	13
0	when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games i new i wanted it my littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible i ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun i lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on	13
0	i got this game for my kids one is 11 and one is 9 they love it they can have like video conferences with their friends and there are a lot of fun games for it like baseball soccer boxing etc hey this even come with the camera i rated 4 stars because of the graffics they are not the best but still acceptible hope this review helps	13
0	i bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys they play this game non stop basically until they 're completely worn out the game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months ! if your kids have a ps2 then this game is a must have ! !	13
0	so these little fellas are inside my computer they run around all day shouting doodlee doo ! doodlee doo ! i'm thinking that they 're up to no good i'm thinking that they 're plotting against me but i ca n't turn them off they say if i do then evil will befall me caution ! beware	13
0	pros exciting and absorbing story line great gaming experience cons some minor bugs single player game cannot replay more than a few times	13
0	this was a well put together game that was lots of fun to play you 'll want to play it again as soon as you finish it i'm not a big star wars fan but i was nuts for this game this was the first rpg i ever tried and once i got over the fact that i was not doing the fighting i really liked it i highly recommend this game unless you already have a weak relationship with your wife kids \( who you wo n't be seeing much of \) or if your boss hates you and is waiting for you to come in late and bleary eyed so he can pink slip you	13
0	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	13
0	no way should children be playing this game it is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players the goals of harming people picking up hookers breaking the law can be a blast as long as everyone knows it 's just a fantasy many people go into the details so i 'll make this short have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts but there 's no way i would consider this game for anyone under 15 and then i would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy	13
0	i 've got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games i 've bought not that they were bad though the funny thing about these kind of games \( so long as you 're using a light gun \) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms it 's no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games \? now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real but then again that is part of what gives the game it 's charm buy the game and a light gun	13
0	time crises is a 5 star gam	13
0	you already knew it was a good game becuase it 's final fantasy probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games this one is probably a little worse than the best final fantasy games \( such as iii and vii \) but despite that what you have here is a game boy advance rpg that has graphics that actually are n't that bad and the storyline is pretty good too you just ca n't go wrong with final fantasy games	13
0	before kurt warner had a career with the st louis rams he played for the arenabowl champion iowa barnstomers when he endorsed this game called kurt warner 's arena football unleashed the music is rockin' and up to date you can crank it up to the sound effects are great on this game if you hear that doink ! sound it looks like a hanna barbera cartoon and the commentary is way better than that tim guy from nfl blitz oh and for every touchdown you be treated to a song of joy as you score for 6 this game is way more better than nfl blitz unfortunately it was the last hope for any more arena football games on any system	13
0	i 'll admit i was a little skeptical about this game as it turns out this game rocks ! arena football fans do not pass this one up ! hopefully when they make the sequel \( yeah i said sequel \) they will include the new afl2 teams tennessee valley vipers rule	13
0	he was exelente but i continue insisting deveria to at least place a paguina with translation to the spanish on the item thus they tendrian but trade here in venezuela without but one takes leave of youemerson	13
0	people plz ive had my ps2 a month after it came out ok i have had 2 controllers the ones i bought that day i play at least 8 or 9 hours during summer 4 to 5 hours a day during school year i have never had any problems at all my cousins have thrown these across the room at the wall when they get mad nothing happens these are very durable	13
0	i like the 05 version better sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function but it does n't appear to me ea sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter i was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe i was expecting too much i wo n't buy the 07 when it comes out i 'll wait and see what they can do with it on playstation 3	13
0	the good it has fairly good graphics the franchise is very real and you can play it up to 30 seasons it has a bunch of new features that madden 05 did n't like the truck stick and nfl superstarthe bad once you 've played this for awhile you 'll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game it get old when you look into the crowd in a game the graphics suck it looks like a big blob of colorsoverall it is a really fun game i hope madden 07 will be better though	13
0	this is a very interesting game lots of places to explore game play is pretty smooth sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot the game is very bookish with no cut scenes from the movie it can be fairly complicated at times with some strange moves to master like flying shoes and umbrellas it 's a fun game with good graphics	13
0	i love this game i have n't played other ddr games before so i'm not sure how it compares to others but this one is great some of the songs i like a lot and some i do n't but they 're all a challenge and fun in some way i like to use the dance master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well i have n't made it all that far because i play the same levels over and over again because they 're so fun this game is great for people of all ages and includes music for the young and old	13
0	if you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a ps2 i would recommend this video game	13
0	i 've been a gta fan for a few years now and to me san andreas has got to be the best one for the first time you can swim ! ! i fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character the graphics are more real making it kind of funky controlling the game but after awhile you 'll get used to it the language is terrible \( more so in this gta version \) so young kids should avoid this like the plague	13
0	there 's a reason everyone loves this game there 's a lot of exciting action ! the popularity of this game is well deserved too because you can do so many things in this game that it 's almost ridiculous driving around is a blast and the many weapons you can use such as shovels baseball bats golf clubs pistols and shotguns truly makes this one incredibly fun and revolutionary game it 's a game you have to own if you 're a fan of video games	13
0	whatever product sony brings to the market you can always be sure that you are buying a top quality product and these sony memory card for ps2 is just the perfect exampl	13
0	dude supy gave this game a bad review supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games it is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the lemony snicket movie the game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you 're not a very skilled gamer \( like my 6 year old \) it 's okay because if you die you just restart the task i have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating	13
0	book fans do n't listen to dude supy because he most likely has n't read the books this game is very fun but does n't last very long at all if you like the books you should rent it you probably wo n't want to buy it though i rented it yesterday and beat it today very fun but not for long	13
0	all the family have played this game and have had a blast sorry you have to use your brain to play this one kids the graphics are great and the puzzle solving is fun we also own the movie	13
0	i ca n't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars you are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible so you 're forced to shop for one online it 's really not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game it 's really dumb	13
0	there are a lot of different memory cards on the market for the ps2 but the official sony 8mb memory card is by far the best card for your system unlike other memory cards available this baby will not fail you that means you can depend on it at all times so to make a long story short do yourself a favor and buy this ever reliable memory card	13
0	this memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced i did n't have to worry about this because mine came with my ps2 it can hold about 40 files thats about 1 file for each game if you have over 40 games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards if you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused the value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng	13
0	this game i purchased for my sons they both told me they enjoyed this game a little tough at first but with any new game you have your challenges if you want a game that is not too easy this is the one ! have fun and do n't let losing take the fun away it is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills	13
0	neat game but i should n't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20 the 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe also i'm the 'hero of kavatch' but i do n't want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds the fact that i saved a town also apparently does n't entitle me to even pick up an item if i do n't own it w o being thrown in prison very realistic	13
0	my son loves this game ! we rented it first from blockbuster and now he wo n't let us take it back so i ordered it from amazon com so i can take the game back soon to blockbuster ! i have to help him through some of the areas like when the penguin is fishing but i do n't mind because it 's fun	13
0	we rented this game for my kids to play with each other the game is labeled 1 2 players but is made for only one player at a single ps2 console the kids are disappointed because now they have to take turns watching each other be aware	13
0	i have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it halo 2 is awsome as are other shooters they can keep the new generation of others xbox had it right on this one and its perfect	13
0	this is a good system with great graphics and a number of good games supports online multiplayer too with an xbox live subscription the only problem i have with the system is that sometimes it freezes i 've had it for about 5 months and it 's probably frozen about 8 or 9 times which can be annoying esp when im in the middle of a game other than that it 's a good system	13
0	if your tired of all the first person shooters and rpgs this game rocks it was 1990 all over again for me love the game since i didnt have anm original playstation i can only comment that the 3d effects they added in this version make the game more appealling for me \) the only issue i have is that you cant play 2 player but i can forgive that	13
0	great shooter game great graphics 100 ship variation this game is five dollars at toys r us	13
0	i really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters so take this opinion with that in mind the only problem with r type is that dying sucks when you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups once you unlock free play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc however overall i think it 's the best of the r types and one of the better side scrollers out there	13
0	i am 23 years old and this game has n't left my ds since i bought it a month ago it 's incredibly fun i would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames you get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking i love these weird japanese games ! i only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes i heard they are making a wii version of cooking mama so i'm hoping that one will have more recipes	13
0	when i first came home with this game and tried it i thought it was going to be kind of dumb but it is lots of fun and kind of addicting i even got my 11yr old son doing some of the cooking plus it is a good price	13
0	i purchased this game for my son and he loves it he plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars i'm glad that we selected this game for him he also has underground hot pursuit and he enjoys that one also	13
0	gamecube has the best controller out of the 3 xbox and ps2 's controllers have buttons that are the same size it 's really confusing really on gamecube 's you know the a buttons the big one b 's the small one and x and y are the kidney shaped ones hard to tell them apart right	13
0	why mess with the original there are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount you get what you pay for i have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality in addition the controls for the gamecube are similar enough to other nintendo products so you wo n't have to learn a completely new system	13
0	the nintendo ds is outstanding it makes playing games and communicating a breeze	13
0	i am using brainage game with this very challenging and i have improved my performance	13
0	will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both	13
0	its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time same differance with highspeed and dialup if you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally i like my 360 remote	13
0	when i heard that square was going to remake final fantasy iv \( originally final fantasy ii in the u s \) i was very excited this game is considered to be one of the greatest final fantasy games of all time all in all i would recomend this game to anyone who is a final fantasy fan	13
0	ok look although this is a old game it is one of the most popular fps \( first person shooter \) games out there ive played this for atleast 5 years now and my friends that i know still play cs today like myself from planting bombs to rescuing hostages you 'll find this game enjoyable there are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps to playing this game 24 7 the screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention espicially the clan trailers if your looking for a great fps game this is it	13
0	in the april 2005 pc gamer magazine it showed the top 50 computer games of all time half life was 1 this is basically a sequel to that game very fun except when you 're in a server with hackers in it just make sure to never give your cd key out and to go to steampowered com and download steam to play it \( for version 1 6 \) then go to browse games and register your cd key once you do that you wo n't be getting as much sleep as you had the past few years	13
0	i liked this game especially with kris kristofferson doing ned 's voice \( should have had more of him in it \) gameplay is short i beat it in less than a day i liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this	13
0	you will not be dissapointed by buying this game ! if you like rpgs action and or adventure games you 'll love this one there is soooooo much to do ! even after you 've beat the game with the huge maps tons of free roaming space and exciting side missions you can play for hours without even starting the main mission the sound and graphics are just about the best i 've ever seen ! the mian story is also awesome it 's easy to follow and tons of fun to play ! buy this ! ! ! !	13
0	i'm going to keep this short because the game does n't deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and short my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it	13
0	i have had this unit for almost 6 months and love it halo 2 is awsome as are other shooters they can keep the new generation of others xbox had it right on this one and its perfect	13
0	this game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play you do n't exactly finish it like other video games but are always trying to beat your fastest time so it does n't get old as fast as a matter of fact we wore out our last copy and this is our second i love it and i'm the parent ! my kids and i play it together and cheer each other on the only thing i would change is make the two player part funner and stop the giant messages that pop up and cover the whole screen occassionally i would keep them in the corner instead overall highly recommend this game more than your money 's worth	13
0	this game is a lot of fun the level of control is actually less challenging in this one then the original and the music is n't as good in this newest version but this game is certainly still a strong choice for those rainy days	13
0	this headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear the big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use wearing the halo 2 headset i actually forgot that i was even wearing it because it is so light they have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price i greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	13
0	this headset is way better than the x box one considering the x box one broke in a hurry the sound quality is awesome and you do n't get any annoying breathing in the mic pick this one up	13
0	i love this game and i 've been playing it every since it came out its not one of those boring after a whilepros good graphics good gameplay lots of mechs live support content download \( a lot ! \) up to 8 people on xbox live lots of missionscons can get a bit repetetiv	13
0	mechassault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to destroy everything in his path and school armys with one huge battle machine destroying other mechs and tanks as well but when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs then you would throw it aside not play it again \? no not if you have xbox live in live you can play capture the flag download new mechs and play with hundreds of players just like you and you will always come back for more if you do n't have xbox live or a system link that your wasting your money	13
0	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
0	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	13
0	this game is truly worth the wait it really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting the gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the gta games this is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome this probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in the cars handle great and are a blast to drive the graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome this is a must get game	13
0	i picked this up along with zelda when buying the wii this game is not for those who like realistic driving games the physics are nothing short of just silly insane but it is so fun ! i love how you get stars for nice crashes and running other trucks off the road the action is fast and the driving is very intuitive \( provided you use the tutorials they teach you all the stunts \) it 's not too hard anyone can play and it 's just fun i love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me highly recommended do n't overlook this game !	13
0	this game is better than madden by a nose but could be better gameplay is better than madden i think	13
0	no other game looks or plays like this the missions and locations are varied and colorful the villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials and as usual rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating lots of unlockables offer high replay this is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system period i still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru the story is straightforward and engaging lots of really interesting concepts \( machinegun in the coffin crazy midgets that whole 'dead eye' thing \) and it controls very well another great game from an outstanding company hopefully a sequel is in the works	13
0	this game is good cheap now buy if you didnt before and if you cant afford gun for 49 99 buy this game cause they copied it	13
0	im a western fanatic i just love the wild west i try to get my eyes or hands on anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu so far this game is awesome i cant wait for the new western game gun coming out in nov one thing this game needs though is the good the bad and the ugly theme \) that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying	13
0	this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta \( grand theft auto \) seriesgraphics 9 10sound 8 10gameplay 7 5 10overall 8 3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever	13
0	totally awesome my favorite game ever the sound is revolutionary the graphics are top notch it is so real you 'll freak although the ps2 version has four extra levels and thirty minutes of impressive new dialoge and cinematics so i would buy the ps2 version if i were you a must own for every gamer it will change your life	13
0	all i had to do was plug it into the console and bring up xbox live and it connected the only thing i did not like is that i would have preferred an ethernet connection in lieu of the usb connection other than that the product worked as intended	13
0	expensive but worth it it just works no more wires	13
0	i enjoy having wireless especially with broadband i have my router over 20 ft from the adapter yet my signal stays strong set up is easy for most although if you have a linksys router wrt 54g ver 2 get ready for some work it took me four calls before someone gave me the right advice since then i have not had any problems a little expensive but worth it in the long run	13
0	i used a linksys media center extender to play and view my music and picture collection through my home theater this product completley replaced the need for the extender was extremely easy to setup \( wep enabled \) and works flawlessly i do not find it overpriced at all given the capabilities for games and interacting with a media center pc the music streaming is every bit as good setup was as simple as plugging in the adapter and entering the security code well done microsoft ! tom las vega	13
0	what else needs to be said even with a low end graphics card this masterpiece is fun ! perfect combination for a laptop notebook too bad sir william gates wo n't allow a pc version of halo 2 well anyways seeya in halo 3 deathmatc	13
0	it is a fun first person shooter game the graphics are decent and the story line 's ok the game 's play time is about 15 20 hours	13
0	i love this game ! the storyline is wonderful ! i guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs ! but what i love is playing multiplayer ! and someone did bash the multiplayer but there are tons of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates ! i 've had this game for years and i never get tired of playing online ! actually it 's kind of addicting	13
0	love this game great story line just make sure your computer can handle it	13
0	action action and satisfaction ! totally awesome and entirtaining this videogame will rock your world ! cool new characters and weapons tactics and awsomeness	13
0	this game is very goodit jsut sucks u in and u cant quit and before u know it it is don	13
0	this is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game you get over 20 different vehicles and guns the tv like gameplay makes for a good story line there 's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first ps2 games gran theft auto 50 driv3r 30 starsky and hutch priceless	13
0	the xbox 360 live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their live account even if you do have the headset the card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game \( limited time offer \) easily helps to make your money back even if they did n't include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate in fact it 's almost like you 're getting a headset for free ! so like i said if you need live buy also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at best buy i checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit	13
0	with the wii right around the corner people are rushing to get one some preordered it while some others \( including me \) are camping out for it but some worry about how old school is fitting into the next gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction sure sideways wii controllers are s nes controllers but what of gamecubes \? i am happy to say that i have gotten a chance to play around with the wii before anyone else and yes the wavebird receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the wii it looks pefectly at home there rejoice gamers ! pick up your wavebirds and play on	13
0	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13
0	i bought a nintendo ds so i can play super mario brothers for ever like i was when i was a kid its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger my 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and i had to buy him a ds along with mario so he could play it after i left to go back home	13
0	i have always loved mario and when i purchased my new nintendo ds lite i bought this with it this game is absolutely amazingly fun ! the graphics sound and the game itself are incredible this game is good for any adult or child although for a younger child it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating \) with this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again and possibly again after that but every time you try again you understand something new about the level and it really is fun there also are the features of becoming mega mario and mini mario which mixes things up every once and a while this game is wonderful definitely a great buy	13
0	i bought the game for my daughter but i play it more than she does this game will give you hours of enjoyment if you love super mario bros	13
0	gta iii rules but its not the greatest game ever thats why it gets overall of 4 but it still is awesome but grand theft auto vice city rules even harder ! ! ! xbox version is best	13
0	star wars kotor 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good rpg 's it starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game i felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	13
0	if you ever played any kotor game u know that its the king of rpgs and i know that u all want the 3rd game to come out to but it isent ! the game got cancelled and a bunch of guys online are tryin to resurect the kotor series by making this petition we dont have no where nere as much as we should 'round 3600 so help us out and go to petition online and help us resurect this great series ! ! !	13
0	i love playing this game the icewind dale ii is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great	13
0	the reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game because i am currently running a game of iwd1 with windows xp as i make this post	13
0	this game is great for those that enjoy role playing games there is a lot of reading involved but it adds to the story it was a lot of fu	13
0	you know what \? i absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard i beat it on normal in one week ! and this was when it first came out when i was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen but anyway this game was so fun ! i got it the week it came out and that christmas vacation me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game or at least watching me play it i have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old	13
0	and three years later i buy the game wow ! awesome ! i ca n't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release ! everything looks and feels great on my xp this is one of the only games i have purchased and and not had to return due to the cd being messed up or some corrupted file so i'm happy ! i thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on yep this is a game i would suggest to any gamer	13
0	this game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time 's but when you get all your force power 's it is so f ing fun you can cut everybody 's arm 's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool	13
0	the introduction isn't boring it isn't long and it is one of the best introductions to a game made by enix se if you do n't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 ! ! ! 1 then do n't buy another rpg for as long as you live rpgs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different if you do n't like it take it back and get a refund do n't play rpg 's like this if you ca n't stand words go play some gta or something oh wait theres words in that too	13
0	yeah this game is really fun just gets extremely hard at times towards the end have a little over 10 hours into it kind of short i guess but each mission might take you a few tries to complete plus the fact you might spend 30 tries on some like i did i 'd say it 's easily one of the best games out for the ds though one that everyone should have in their ds collection	13
0	this game is so creative it 's really atypical and really exciting	13
0	my son has had many happy hours with this game it came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy	13
0	my husband just bought this for my five year old daughter \( preschool graduation gift \) \) she has n't been able to leave it alone now she 's a little more advanced in the world of gaming than some her age and definitely better than me her mom so i ca n't recommend it for every kid but if your kid is adept at x box they should enjoy this one it does n't hurt that she loves the movie as well	13
0	i \( 37 \) played this game with my nephew \( 8 \) the other night on his birthday this is a great game funny characters have great individual personalities traits ! just like ever with any cool game we started playing laughed alot lost track of time 1 hour had passed he was playing ps2 im buying it for my xbox tonight you should buy it for your system definitely worth it ! !	13
0	this product is excellent has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time good perfromanc	13
0	this is a great memory card for people with only a few gcn games but those who have a bigger collection will either need to buy two or the gcn memory card 1019	13
0	my kids really like the memory cards because they can keep playing there game once they get off andthey save it	13
0	unfortunately it is too short and easy along with the lack of depth to the game and the story mode is a bit weak however they make up in that with the classic mode and what else is great about this game is that its still highly addicting even after a year of use while most others are forgettable a month or two after purchase i reccomend you buy this rather than thug1 or thaw i garantee you will enjoy this game for a while	13
0	this product arrived quickly and in excellent shape thanks for being a quality shop this product is hard to find in a store thanks again	13
0	best fighting game i have played in a long time the characters are coo	13
0	i 've done most of the nancy drew games now and a couple csi and law and order games nancy drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than csi i also had so many problems with bugs with the csi and law and order games not so with nancy drew and a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	13
0	this game was great ! it 's easy to get stuck at the beginning but after you get off the train it goes by really fast in this one nancy is on a train that might be haunted lori girard \( your host \) invites a bunch of people including frank and joe hardy \( you actually get to play as frank in one part of the game \) then odd things start happening on the train lori disappears apparently in thin air then the train 's emergency brake is pulled this is a really fun game !	13
0	this is a great game for puzzel lovers and is n't easy this is a great game to play on stormy dark night sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save just when you think you have it figured out something new happens even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time trust me you will never be bored	13
0	i dont know what everyone else 's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome ! the graphics are out of this world and its very suspenseful there 's a murder or dead body around every corner and you get to firgure out who did it ! the ending was the best it took me and my brother at least 24 hours \( not all at once of course \) to solve this mystery it 's a really great buy ! andre	13
0	i absolutely loved this game i could n't stay off my computer it was addicting the game was long but the puzzels and clues really get you thinking it was very entertaining and i would recommend it to everyone who loves a mystery i ca n't wait until the next one comes out	13
0	this game is simply awesome i received it for a gift last christmas and i still love it the graphics action are amazing it 's not available on xbox if you do n't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece you 'll love it the main character kratos reminds me of quan chi in mortal kombat looking forward to god of war 2	13
0	it 's worth playing and spending hours of playing warning this game is rated mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc no need to buy the walkthrough because the game it 's not really that difficult ca n't wait for god of war 2 that will come out 2007 \( which luckily for ps2 instead of ps3 \)	13
0	these games represent glory days in the age of computing like classic movies they will always have a place and be replicated though never duplicated let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games and something that needs to be in all caps call on vivendi to give those incredible designers of the silver lining financial and commercial support !	13
0	this game is just freakin' awesome im not that big into video games and i really only play them when i have someone to play against i stay away from one player mode because i get bored and cannot talk smack then came duty i played this game through on all the difficulty modes from medium up and never got bored plus if you 've got a nice group of folk to play with and a way to separate screens to prevent looking multiplayer is sweet \( esp if you break up into teams \) and you can talk smack all day long best graphics and gameplay of any game ive ever seen	13
0	great game higly addictive and gets really tuff once you play on veteran 's mode ! definately a game to have in your collection	13
0	this game is amazing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the only problem is that in order to get some achievments you have to play it on veteran mode sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle one time i was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game only three shots will kill you i had to restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it	13
0	i agree with some of the reviews about the rush and need to keep up with the happiness tied to immigrant status that being said i spent endless hours researching and building and thoroughly enjoyed this game well worth the cost and enjoyable i am not familiar with the other civ games and was looking more for a city building game set in the past similar to my favorite game children of the nile perhaps that explains why i was not disappointed	13
0	very good overall graphic voices good sometimes funny sometimes sarcastic pc game should have a readme file that gives maps and walkthroughs	13
0	i love this game ! i love the training exercises being able to compare them with other who creat files on my game and i especially love the sudokus ! ! ! i feel smarter already	13
0	just thought i 'd share my my opinion i think id2 is a great game with a very deep lore great graphics replayability and more if your into rpg games this is right up your alley	13
0	graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any rpg fan	13
0	this game is very good they only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool the game folows the movies well you can even blow up buildings the only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave lastly you can get in high speed cases with the cops	13
0	the godfather the game allows you to live the godfather movies the storyline and characters pertains to the movies very well the missions get repetitive over time because every mission involves driving driving and more driving ! but overall if your a fan of the godfather like i am you wont care \( respect the family !	13
0	i bought this game a bit late \( 2 years after it came out \) but it still seemed state of the art to me ! loved the story and gameplay has improved significantlypros huge map with 5 massave areas to explore tons of vehicles you might not see the same one twice ! cool new features like vehicle customization endless stuff to do ! multiplayer modecons character customization prosess can be annoying if you leave the game on without pausing you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back \( ie all your muscle going down \) go buy this game you will really like i	13
0	i like the gta series of games and this one is great too i can turn up my settings to max \( my computer is over a year old \) and there are no problems the kid reviewer claims that he does n't like the n f bomb that is why this is rated m for mature \( so he should not even be playing it \) to give the series a taste some things cannot be eliminated this is a fun games just exploring the city or completing missions	13
0	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	13
0	when i started playing this game it was hard for me to stop i play it every chance i get and the best thing about it i got it for far less money from amazon com	13
0	had this game on our gamecube so addicting then now we have it on our ds and it is just as much fun only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff you have to get a certain rating i believe like a d nonetheless it is a great game worth the money ! if you have kids the kids will thoroughly enjoy	13
0	if you are a ds owner this game is a must have you will not be disappointed	13

0	i got shrek 2 a couple christmases \( is that right \? \) ago and i gotta say it was alright the pros are that it is up to four players \( so if dad wants to spend quality time with junior \) it has a wide variety of fun characters and plenty of levels however it lacks graphics and young children might not do well during the game but overall its alrightgraphics c it must have been released early cuz it 's pretty badsound b crisp sounds the sound really matches the mood controls a changing and controlling characters' a breezegood for children and adults to	13
0	my just turned 6 year old can figure out 70 of the logic needed in this game he ca n't do a very few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy i had to finally defeat for him but he really likes this game he gets the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters it has a tad more killing of stuff than i care for but what does n't these days he likes being able to be different characters his favorite is puss n boots ! as a grown up i enjoyed it as well especially the humor	13
0	the graphics are pretty imbarasing the object of the game is to get snapshots and you get these snapshots by completing missions levels and hero times \( a specific mission were you use one character \) some of the levels are fun like the far far away level \( it has a grand theft auto theme \) i give the graphics a 3 5 \( i think they should have done a better job on the main characters \) audio 4 5 gameplay 4 5 5 fun a 4 5 5 and an overall of 3 5	13
0	the incredibles is a fun 1 player game that puts you in the role of being the incredibles even though it is short pros amazing characters great graphics intresting plot footage from the movie can be accessed through the game as well as artworkcons short only 1 playeroverallif you loved the incredibles on the big screen you will like the game as well the same plot and characters and great visuals are there but much it is not very lengthy	13
0	this game is fun to play but not the greatest game either of course the movie is way better than the game the game is pretty easy and is short considering there are 18 levels the storyline in the beginning could have been alittle better as well some of the missions are pretty hard but after you pass the tough ones it just gets easy again all in all it 's a good game i would recommend it the graphics are good i do like how they put some storyline in from the movie it 's not to bad of a game to play	13
0	i know how you feel about the incredibales movie it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys violet is just running around invisible elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile was n't the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no i in team well you are all by you 're self in this playing one charcter per level please note all movies made into games are ba	13

0	the price of the card is about 7 10 cheaper than in the stores but what is the point if you have to pay 10 shipping \( express \) or about 7 \( office depot \) who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not amazon this much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke	13
0	this site is the cheapest i have found for this card 60 br 62 do not pay for your live service monthly on your credit card 60 br 62 it 's alot cheaper to buy one of these cards every year	13
0	i had a chance to buy this game machine for my 10yr old boy with super mario two monitors are bright enough to play with even under the sun light and battery runs long enough at least almost all day long after they came back from school till they go to bed as long as you do full charge during the night i was a game watch gameboy psp player but once you start to use this machine you will instantly understand why this game machine became mega hit machine easily i am planning to purchase another one for my younger daughter to let them enjoy communication system with 2 machines	13
0	i bought it coz i always wanted something like this after i got it i just went and bought a game i made the little mistake to ask who i am living with that said i dont like games which one should i buy well we picked animal crossing and the machine and the games are so good that i havent been able to play it too often it was taken away from me hehehehehso my review is his and he sais that it deserves five star	13
0	this is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the ps2 for all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant well do some research ! i can figure out a way to solve the problem and i'm only 13 ! you are all over 21 ! ar max memory has a formatting feature which scrapes all of the corrupted data away yes you will lose your hard earned saves but that 's the price for cheating who ever said that cheating would be fair \? overall besides the max memory portion this item is great	13
0	i liked this game i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok i mean it also comes with chrono trigger if you have played chrono cross and got confused that means you never played trigger	13
0	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13
0	in the persuit of keeping you 360 cool it does the job quite well but as a side affect it is quite loud which may detur someone from using it	13
0	my friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh it`s a must have ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	13
0	the e reader is one of the best things that happened to nintendos gba this is so swea	13
0	if you liked the original then you will also like kh2 it finishes the story nicely battle commands are improved i especially like the reaction commands still has some camera issues overall a good game	13
0	if you liked the first kh you will like this one	13
0	so if it 's such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating \? well it 's a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating and it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me they physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so but everything else is great about it graphics are great not excellent but great sound is great too gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed kinda on the easy side in normal level though but i guess nothing is perfect go ahead and get this one it 's worth what it costs	13
0	i honestly hate fighting games i think they 're boring and they do n't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by enter tekken tekken has been around for many years when it first came out everyone loved it it used to compete with virtua fighter on the sega saturn i was impressed then and i'm impressed now all these years later the action is just a lot of fun you really could n't ask for a better fighting game the graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments i love the game and i hope you do as well	13
0	in terms of overall quality this game is light years better than tekken 4 the graphics are terrific the gameplay has improved dramatically and they got rid of that annoying position change feature i especially love the customization feature my only problem is playing against jinpachi who usually takes me about 15 tries before getting a lucky shot to beat him other than that this game is terrific	13
0	this is a vary good game one of the best on the ps2 these are my top ten favorite fighters1 \) asuka kazama2 \) christie monteior3 \) ling xiaoyu4 \) kazuya mishima5 \) jin kazama6 \) king7 \) eddy gordo8 \) nina williams9 \) anna williams10 \) devil jinthe only bad thing is jinpachi mishima cant be unlocked which sucks the devilwithin mini game is ok arcade is ranked overall the games is awsome and addicting you 'll be playing for hours on end later	13
0	i have this monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable \( about 65 for both \) and can say that it 's the best connection you can find for your old xbox however i ca n't really recommend them due to their high prices if you can find the microsoft hd pack get that as it 's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable the only reason i bought this setup was because of their length \( 10 feet \) which can go from one side of my entertainment center \( where the xbox is \) to the other side \( where the stereo receiver is	13
0	one feature that has n't been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you wo n't hear any extra noise from emf also make sure you check your xbox settings once you 've plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under display settings for choosing hd capabilites make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there is n't that much difference	13
0	monster cables have superior construction and always deliver the best quality sound and video they cost a little more but i found mine on amazon cheap and got free shipping saved 20 over retail and got shipment within 3 days i'm happy	13
0	this game is tons of fun ! my husband children \( ages 6 and 7 \) and i have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game i definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game this game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker	13
0	this game is hard but very fun so if you want to pick between fantastic four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you	13
0	i would recommend this to those who just wants more than just shooting at fat ass people or aliens just slobbering on cra	13
0	great tutorial and hands on learning this game is action packed with fight moves jumps combos etc my only complaint was hulk 's reaction time during running but that 's easily overlooked when you blowing up stuff a definate buy	13
0	5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is light jak is freakin awesome after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves a must buy for anyone looking for a non stop action game	13
0	this was a present for my brother so i do n't know what it was like but he said it is the best 3rd person game on the x box	13
0	this is the first wireless controller that i have ever used that did n't lag constantly in fact mine has never lagged not even when the batteries were low the range is more than enough for any room in my home actually i have taken it outside between online mathces and kept chatting with the other players so it even works through doors and windows great product that i now have two of them and have retired the wired controller	13
0	this is one of the best controller i ever have grip felling and handeled are good as experience i recomende	13
0	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
0	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
0	it 's a very good product but it only can be shipped within u s so i ca n't buy i	13
0	you can connect this to the game boy player as well plus connect it to the e reader to download e reader information into your cub	13
0	i love this game once i started playing i could n't stop my ds battery is dead after like 3 days i play so much once you get into the game it is really hard to stop playing you get new moves and new weapons thus making the game new all the time the controls are easy to learn and the story is easy to get into so lets all tip our hats to nintendo and all there mario greatness	13
0	spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played it was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating there are alot of xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old this game was not meant for an adult gaming audience i was surprised when i realized this game is no longer in production there should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket my son loves this game he literally wore it out i have to find him another copy of hero 's tail to replace his old one	13
0	you get to be different animals it is a really cool game i recommend it to other kids to buy the cheetah get shoot bow and arrows	13
0	wow that 's all i can say all the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game' just got it a few days ago and am so impressed with all that 's packed into it ! ! ! it also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises this is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen people of all fitness levels can enjoy this this technology \( interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts \) has got to be the wave of the future ! !	13
0	this game is really good but i do n't think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long so if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game	13
0	i love this game for what it is you cannot expect this to be anything like madden but it is still a fun game injuries are awesome and game play is very fast paced fast paced something i cannot say about the loading this game is the slowest loading game i have ever played it actually took three minutes for it to load one time get this game provided that you can wait a little bit	13
0	this is an unorthodox football game this is not an nfl game but a football game w made up teams in a made up league there are 3 divisions and you start at the bottom beat the division 3 level move up to 2 beat 2 to go to 1 beat 1 to beat the game as you move up you also unlock rewards if you 're tired of madden 's franchise mode give this game a try it wo n't get outdated just because of nfl free agency	13
0	load time be prepaired to wait ! other then that it 's a fun game that keeps you playing	13
0	for anyone who loves football and everything about it knows their is also a dark side of the game where players take illegal drugs to help out their game where owners will do anything for their team to win this game is alot like any given sunday remember win at any cos	13
0	i love this game it is so much fun even though my wife does not like it i recommend this game for anyone who like mario kart games enjoy the races and do n't forget to blow your friends up	13
0	i like this game i play it 4 times in a day with out stoppin	13
0	i have been a fan of this game ever since playing against my buddy on my vacation in colorado last year whether you 're interested in pure speed and competative racing or taking your opponents out in road rage it 's all fun ! in addition you can just cause unbelievable mayhem with crash mode where the whole object is to cause as much destruction as possible this game lasts a long time so you have a lot to do it never gets boring i mean there are like 50 cars and trucks waiting for you if you can win them	13
0	i luv this game it is so much fuuuuuuuuuun ! ! ! ! i hate you ppl who say it is stupid i think you are stupid buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	13
0	the ds is hands down the best handheld on the market today the black color is a really nice option too i think it looks much more elegant the only complaint i can think of is how fingerprints show up pretty bad on the black	13
0	if i had to pick one system to play exclusively based on several factors i 'd choose the ds now i'm glad i have the option \( i e money \) to keep purchasing home consoles but if in some bizarro world where i could only take one system well you get the idea in a way the ds reminds me of the ps2 it 's a bargain it 's backwards compatible so it plays gba game the games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around 30 you ca n't go wrong	13
0	this title is the tre sequel to railroad tycoon if you loved the old 1990 's original you 'll enjoy this one as well only con to the game is replayablity which is very limited	13
0	i 've never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game a number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in railroads as compared to rrt3 which is absolutely correct if you are seeking a complex simulation railroads is not the game for you if however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads it is one of my favorite games of all time	13
0	the best set of wireless controllers i have purchased for my xbox system the controllers are nicely fitted for comfortable use and does not cramp up your hands after hours of play connects great and no interruptions while game playing i highly recommend these to anyone that is looking to buy controllers out there they are awesome looking great for playing halo 2 i use it alot with this game and it is the bomb plus my ranking has gone up since using it while playing on xbox live	13
0	i think it 's a great game and you can play online with other people around the world it 's good your 're able to play online because after awhile the easy level gets to be boring there are different levels to keep your intrest the campains are really awsom they never become boreing the mythology in it is real this game is a real high easily gets addictive days of fun	13
0	my son is enthralled with this game ! he is learning while being entertained the graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the mac ! what more could we ask for	13
0	the memory card 1019 from nintendo is excellent for saving gamecube saves i used to have to delete old save files in favor of ones for newer games and some games required so much space that it was impossible to save anything from them i tried some 3rd party brands before but the gamesaves often became corrupted i have had this memory card for nearly a year now and nothing i have saved has become corrupted even with nearly 60 different gamesaves on it some for some rather large games like the sims 2 i still have more than enough space left the price is a bit more expensive but its quality has more than made up for it already	13
0	i bought this game used and wish that i could find a dozen more like it i do not like video game violence i do n't want to kill people but i love the whole exploring a world figuring out puzzles angle this game was perfect for that it had attractive graphics an interesting premise and good challenges on the downside it does n't really call out to be replayed once you get through it once which is why it 's better to buy it used \( and why i wish they 'd make a sequel !	13
0	if you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game it is as if you are the star of the film but that also means that there are many cut scenes these cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic but there are those of you out there that do n't liek cut scenes at all if this is the case for you reader do n't buy this game if you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you ca n't go wrong with this game i have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price it is that good if you like cut scenes	13
0	this was a good game that keeps you thinking the story line is that something terrible has happened and you end up being able to go back in time to change events and therefore change the outcome you get to go back to different era 's such as the horse and buggy era and back to modern day there are several endings as well depending on what you 've done you end up playing it through several times to experience the different endings the plot of the story is good and the game has a good pace because time is an issue so you feel like you got to stay on your toes	13
0	another castlevania game means more excitement going around whipping everything in sight never gets boring because the gameplay of castlevania has been an interesting one for many many years i love the graphics they are truly something magnificent the special effects from all the enemies is really a nice welcoming touch just the overall atmosphere of the game is dark and spooky the way a castlevania game should be this game follows the formula that was featured in symphony of the night which means if you like the metroid style of gaming you will love this game as well	13
0	this game i purchased for my sons they both told me they enjoyed this game a little tough at first but with any new game you have your challenges if you want a game that is not too easy this is the one ! have fun and do n't let losing take the fun away it is a game to be played and it will enhence your skills	13
0	neat game but i should n't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20 the 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe also i'm the 'hero of kavatch' but i do n't want to be reminded of it every 6 seconds the fact that i saved a town also apparently does n't entitle me to even pick up an item if i do n't own it w o being thrown in prison very realistic	13
0	this is a well done game especially if you liked the movie characters voices and behavior are consistent with the movie and there 's a cute storyline to the game there are a number of stages that you follow in order completing one to move to the next there 's a pretty small age window that its good for i 'd say about 6 to 10 under 6 the stages are too hard over 10 they 're sort of easy and not that engaging you can fly thru pretty quickly it would be a bit better if you could jump around and play the games that you enjoy instead of having to go sequentially but it 's still well done and worth buying	13
0	many games my kids have are n't actually geared towards kids this game is perfect for children it 's fun without being too hard or easy my children are 6 and 8 years old and can be challenged and entertained i highly recommend this as a great family game many games we can take turns playing	13
0	this works great for charging both my ds lite and classic ds from usb i also like the included keychain flashlight it 's kind of random thing to include that is in no way related to the charger but it 's quite bright and handy to have anyways i'm not sure why the previous reviewer says that it does n't fit the ds lite it does perfectly perhaps she is trying to use the gba micro adapter that is included \? you do n't need to the adapter is only to charge classic ds gba or gba micro the cable itself is all you need to charge ds lite	13
0	madden comes out again but with some stupid lead blocking controls i think this is as dumb as tha qb vision controls y cant they come out with something good	13
0	i find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see however my major disappointment comes from the graphics i understand the ps2 does n't not have the standards of the xbox360 but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for i just hope when the ps3 comes out madden will rerelease the game for it to give the xbox360 owners something to whine about ea should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have	13
0	just great all around nice work from microsoft and their newly launched marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers xbox live really is a great gaming experience	13
0	i bought this game a couple months ago and i absolutely love it ! i am 14 and kids and parents of all ages will love ths ! it 's great excerise and very challenging with cool music it 's like ddr only with your hands try it i promise you 'll have a great time i could play it all day	13
0	if you already have an eye toy and your favorite game on it is beat freak then you have to get eye toy groove the 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music from elvis to good charlotte as a 46 year old woman i got this as an alternative of boring repetitive workout tapes with great success the game even has a calorie counter built in this is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids ages from 8 to 16 even the preschoolers i occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening which is more than i can say for dance dance revolution	13
0	my daughter got the eye toy for her birthday and we recently added the dance groove game to the collection she and her friends \( 10 yrs of age \) really enjoy it as do some of the younger kids she says her only complaint is that the most difficult skill level is nearly impossible to master so they improvise which is pretty easy to do if you stand really close to the camera	13
0	when i went online looking at reviews i started to get rather edgy about buying this game but omg ! this is a great game sure it is n't the best ff game out there but it is definately one of the better gun games out there sometimes the graphics get rather distorted but i think that the a graphics in the middle of the game really make up for it i'm glad that vincent finally gets his own game in short you people who hate this game are wierd	13
0	i bought it for my grandson and have not heard any complaints as a matter of fact i have n't heard any noise he is to busy playing it	13
0	my 9 year old and 16 year old fight over this game my 9 year old owns the game she has asked me to buy her 16 year old sister the game so she will leave hers alone it is a great game that will hold your attention	13
0	i am 23 years old and this game has n't left my ds since i bought it a month ago it 's incredibly fun i would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames you get rated bronze silver or gold for your cooking i love these weird japanese games ! i only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes i heard they are making a wii version of cooking mama so i'm hoping that one will have more recipes	13
0	hi i am 11 yrs old and my next door neighboor 's little sister got a pink nintendo lite she is 6 yrs old and she recieved it for her birthday with the nintendo ds lite she recieved cooking mama i started to play it and it was really fun ! it is fun to get new recipies and prepare the food my favorite is making the pizza and beef stew	13
0	i just got this game last night and i am amazed ea sports really delivered with this one the race for the heisman mode is simply amazing all the problems and slowness of the game from last year have picked up and the presentation is a lot more appealing the game is probably the best football game i have ever played definately a must have for any football fan	13
0	this game is fun you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities you can even go the wrong way for me \( older adult \) it was fun to play with my kids but i found it repetitive and boring after a while of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game	13
0	i 've only had this controller for a few days and i have found that the layout is the same as the black controller i do wish that the thumb controls were a little softer as they hurt my thunb while playing an exciting game	13
0	this is the original playstation controller and it is the best it feels great in your hands not too heavy best button response and overall just the best controller you can buy if you have been thinking about buying a controller with a different feeling i strongly reccommend do not buy the big mad catz controller it does not feel good in your hands its too big and heavy and the button response sucks just stick with the sony controler it is the best of the best	13
0	gamecube has the best controller out of the 3 xbox and ps2 's controllers have buttons that are the same size it 's really confusing really on gamecube 's you know the a buttons the big one b 's the small one and x and y are the kidney shaped ones hard to tell them apart right	13
0	will you people stop wining about witch is better the psp and the ds both have ups and downs they are just as good they just have differnt prices trust me i own both	13
0	its simple you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but it takes a lot more time same differance with highspeed and dialup if you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler personally i like my 360 remote	13
0	when i heard that square was going to remake final fantasy iv \( originally final fantasy ii in the u s \) i was very excited this game is considered to be one of the greatest final fantasy games of all time all in all i would recomend this game to anyone who is a final fantasy fan	13
0	ok look although this is a old game it is one of the most popular fps \( first person shooter \) games out there ive played this for atleast 5 years now and my friends that i know still play cs today like myself from planting bombs to rescuing hostages you 'll find this game enjoyable there are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps to playing this game 24 7 the screenshots and trailers could even grab your attention espicially the clan trailers if your looking for a great fps game this is it	13
0	i bought this for my daughter because she loves to sing i didn't have any idea that it would be so fun that the whole family would join in and play for hours ! it was so fun that we immediately had to buy the kareoke cmt country game also	13
0	this game is great for when you have a group of friends come over it really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining i suggest this game for everybody	13
0	i bought this game for an adult birthday party it was a hit the game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game you have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc you can also change the mode to the traditional karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen it 's definitely for all ages even my two year old ca n't get enough of it the selection of music is good be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes	13
0	when i first started playing fable i was amazed how much possibility there was to forge your own destiny where one simple decision could alter your destiny for good or evil forever when you start out as a young boy who 's village is burned plundered and the entire town murdered you feel sorry for the boy as his life has been taken from him from then on he is to become a hero as you embark on a long journey and make choices along the way you will forge you own personal destiny with a well written storyline to back it up this game amplifies your freedom to forge your destiny	13
0	of all the karaoke games we have used this is by far the best it 's fun to pick out all of the different outfits for the characters it has more songs than the previous karaoke game we have there are the are different options like duets and in sing offs you can see who can get the best score hours of fun fun fun ! !	13
0	for the price is a good deal i only use one card i have the other one for backup nice product good pric	13
0	the memory cards came exactly as advertised and they worked great no read errors very noticeable increased speed of load time compared to other card types would recommend to anyone looking for a value pack of memory cards because this was well worth it	13
0	i had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	13
0	these are the best memory cards you can get for the ps2 only get this one or the sony playstation 2 1pk memory card rumors spread that non sony memory cards can damage your ps2 and lose saves on you memory cards	13
0	they 're nice cards i never had a problem since i had 3 ps2s in my house at the time we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine then my boyfriend bought me these and i always had my own memory cards no one else could say they were theirs or anything else the only problem i can think of is that they are a little expensive	13
0	my 9 year old daughter loves ps2 so buying the cards were worth the cost	13
0	as you can imagine having 2 separate cards for saving games and info is perfect ! by the way the seller was beyond awesome hope you can get yours from the same !	13
0	beautiful gameplay and cinema graphics bring new life to the valkyrie epic the storyline is every bit as compelling as the original with some new twists valkyrie profile 2 is one of the last best games that will ever hit the ps2 making it a must buy on a personal note this game made me want to play the original again before starting it so i highly recommend playing vp1 through before starting vp2	13
0	i liked this game i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok	13
0	after my little brother lost my original copy i had to buy a new one and i am so glad i did i love the game and it was so much fun to play like all final fantasy game the graphics were amazing as was the gameplay	13
0	if you liked final fantasy 3 you 'll like this game you 'll play some then learn some more of the story	13
0	i liked this game especially with kris kristofferson doing ned 's voice \( should have had more of him in it \) gameplay is short i beat it in less than a day i liked it but like one other person said you better have something else to play after this	13
0	i'm going to keep this short because the game does n't deserve a review longer than the actual game play great idea tons of fun addictive and short my only complaint just when i was digging the game i beat it alittle disappointing definitely worth 20 just make sure you have something else to do after you beat it	13
0	just great all around nice work from microsoft and their newly launched marketplace will really put the push on the other manufacturers xbox live really is a great gaming experience	13
0	i 'd recommend this to anyone who has or ever will play a video game in their life i also recommend it to those that never will it 's just plain awesome	13
0	this headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear the big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use wearing the halo 2 headset i actually forgot that i was even wearing it because it is so light they have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price i greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	13
0	this doesnt come with the communicator part that goes in the controller this is just the headset and it sucks you 'd be better off buying one of the cheap ones with the headset that wraps around your head this one always falls out of my ear in my opinion a waste of 25 bucks chris	13
0	this is a fun game if your inti the mechs the graphics are good but like the first halo game type the difficulty level are weak to easy to kill stuff but expert setting there only like 7 mechs and then varients of those ones that just have differnet weapons loadout the multiplayer is good but not great	13
0	this was a top notch game i really enjoyed playing it it was a well designed thoroughly enjoyable shooter the good looking girl calling you cowboy all the time was a bit silly \( especially since my wife was also playing the game at the same time i was \) if you 've already played halo and you 're looking for a different but enjoyable shooter then try this one	13
0	mechassault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to destroy everything in his path and school armys with one huge battle machine destroying other mechs and tanks as well but when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs then you would throw it aside not play it again \? no not if you have xbox live in live you can play capture the flag download new mechs and play with hundreds of players just like you and you will always come back for more if you do n't have xbox live or a system link that your wasting your money	13
0	very scary at first i was literely shaking while playing this game i could n't stop playing it ! !	13
0	this is one awesome game play it online or against the computer i do suggest online for more fun in the long run if you really wanna give yourself a scare turn out the lights and turn up the volume definetely the scariest first person shooter out there	13
0	blinx can be very time consuming for us older xbox players \( whom did n't grow up with a controller in our hands \) i found blinx to be fun entertaining and challenging even though it is rated for younger children i think the strategy involved is for older children teenagers and some of us adults for anyone wishing to have some fun have to think a bit blinx is for you	13
0	let me start off by saying ditto to previous comments about compdude being off track the keys are in there i found all four of these games to be great i have n't gotten into the lotr one yet because it 's graphics intensive and i have a laptop the other three games are cool too for the price it 's a great deal \( compare to buying the titles individually \)	13
0	i ordered this set primarily for lotr return of the king but after i got it it turns out my graphics chip was not powerful enough to play it but i was able to play the other three games and i really enjoyed freedom fighters and medal of honor black and white was okay but i was n't able to get into it but it should be noted that with black and white you get both the original game and the expansion pack creature isle so you are really getting five games instead of four so i highly recommend this set if you are want to play some good but not so modern games and spend little money	13
0	i have only played this game for what 20 minutes and in the first 5 fell in love w the game i liked the stage where you can get on to the great wall of china \( i think thats what it is \) and my dad played this and for 4 minutes and gave the wii a 8 10 ! he said it could go up if he played more the controls are so easy and fun ! ! ! i highly recommend this to any wii gamer or person who is getting a wii	13
0	a lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good but it is my favorite game to play on the wii doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun and you get bonus points for ramming your opponents if it were only like that on real roads	13
0	i picked this up along with zelda when buying the wii this game is not for those who like realistic driving games the physics are nothing short of just silly insane but it is so fun ! i love how you get stars for nice crashes and running other trucks off the road the action is fast and the driving is very intuitive \( provided you use the tutorials they teach you all the stunts \) it 's not too hard anyone can play and it 's just fun i love flying through the air and morphing the terrain of the track around me highly recommended do n't overlook this game !	13
0	one of the best ds games i ever had it does not take to be a lawyer to get fully satisfied with this game although this is a heavily text based game \( i mean really heavy ! \) you wo n't get tired of reading the storylines and following the details i know you wo n't find this in any stores nowadays so try to order here at amazon this game 's one of the best	13
0	i ordered this game based on reviews alone it 's great ! will not disappoint the only flaw is that some evidence is very specific even when something else can be objected other than that a great game hope to see a sequel	13
0	nothing bad to mention it this control is the original works very well good price	13
0	ok i 've had this controller for 3 years and nothing happend to it it has fallen maney times and nothing happend some kid wrotethat it 's a rip off for 24 bucks ! ! well thats the best deal you 'll get it 's way better than the stupid bulky xbox controllers xbox may have better grathics but the games stink and xbox 's can catch on fire	13
0	the continuation of the sims2 game renews the fun for me with every expansion pack the smaller expansions in between the big ones ie glamour life stuff and or holiday mini pack are good in my book because i get tired of the same decor and clothing after a while it 's nice to get fresh things although ea could just bundle those small expansions in with one of the bigger ones like sims2 nightlife or sims2 pets for examples regardless i still love the sims2 and i look forward to more enhancements in the future	13
0	this is a very interesting game lots of places to explore game play is pretty smooth sometimes a rapid fire button will help you a lot the game is very bookish with no cut scenes from the movie it can be fairly complicated at times with some strange moves to master like flying shoes and umbrellas it 's a fun game with good graphics	13
0	the xbox version of this game is way better for one the graphics are enhanced not crappy like the ps2 version and second of all loading time and processing time is is literally cut in half so dont buy this version suck it up and buy an xbox oh and if this game bores you you either were n't using cheats or u havent played the missions atleast throughlos santos	13
0	basically if you like 04 05 and 06 you will like this game as nothing but the rankings really has changed its the same commentary gameplay and a few new graphics i like it as its a lot of fun im glad they didnt change it remember the old saying if it aint broke dont fix it this is a great game to play and as close to being there as you can ge	13
0	no other game looks or plays like this the missions and locations are varied and colorful the villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials and as usual rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating lots of unlockables offer high replay this is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system period i still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru the story is straightforward and engaging lots of really interesting concepts \( machinegun in the coffin crazy midgets that whole 'dead eye' thing \) and it controls very well another great game from an outstanding company hopefully a sequel is in the works	13
0	im a western fanatic i just love the wild west i try to get my eyes or hands on anything western wild west tech desperados wild wild west gbatu so far this game is awesome i cant wait for the new western game gun coming out in nov one thing this game needs though is the good the bad and the ugly theme \) that would make this game perfect but untill they dicide to add it im loopin the song on my cd player with the tv volume down almost all the way just enough to here what there saying	13
0	this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2 the warriors bully and the world famous gta \( grand theft auto \) seriesgraphics 9 10sound 8 10gameplay 7 5 10overall 8 3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever	13
0	very good stealth type game this game is really addicting and keeps you playing its a really intense game and gets harder level by level one of them games where it makes you think you gotta think what your next move should be like coming up to a room and theres 2 guards patrolling it should you take them out \? or sneak past them \? alot of stuff like that hands down a really fun game	13
0	this is a pretty decent looking diablo style rpg game that adds another chapter to the game sacred in underworld you explore more areas farther north in the world of ancaria i found the new levels were not super great for being fun to explore rather difficult and a little confusing but there are interesting new quests and the original game world is nicely expanded and can be played with 2 new characters the dwarf and demoness the original sacred game has been known to have a lot of small bugs and glitches which many were eliminated or minimized thanks to the underworld epansion pack	13
0	i bought this after it had been out a year so not as much available on line as there was a year ago also it is a german game so limited usa playing but i loved the first sacred i also loved sacred underworld if you do n't plan on on line playing sacred is worth the money	13
0	as the title suggests sacred underworld is pretty much the same as sacred but a little better so if you like sacred sacred underworld is very well worth playing	13
0	as far as wireless bridges go this item is expensive some can be had for 40 50 at other sites but those items are a seperate item with another plug and would require more space this adapter is designed to work perfectly with the the 360 and does just that it connects to the back of the console \( and hd dvd drive if you purchase that \) and use the power of the 360 it does n't take up any extra space and has a strong connection i would recommend it to anyone that has a wireless network in their home	13
0	all i had to do was plug it into the console and bring up xbox live and it connected the only thing i did not like is that i would have preferred an ethernet connection in lieu of the usb connection other than that the product worked as intended	13
0	when i first heard of this game i basically ignored it then when i was visiting gamestop one day i decided to buy it i was instantly amazed by the unique battle system the bright and cheerful backdrops \( except for twilight town that is \) and the challenging and profound gameplay i have not played the first one but i will probably get it from the virtual console on wii one problem with the game is that it 's too short	13
0	i 've been playing mario games since the original debut on the nes and am extremely happy with my purchase of this game the rpg style is a great offshoot for the mario franchise the dialogue animations and surprises are hilarious and the 30 hours i spent playing the game were well worth it there 's a large amount of replayability as there are tons of badges and shine sprites to find i will agree with a previous review about the frustration of not being able to skip cut scenes most of it is the pain of having to tab through tons of dialogue which can grow tiresome if you get stuck at a certain point and have to consistently watch the same section over and over	13
0	i am an old lady trying to play a kids' game i aprreciate the fact that this game explains the moves to me very clearly i have enjoyed playing it and so have my grandchildren i am very glad i purchased it	13
0	it is a fun first person shooter game the graphics are decent and the story line 's ok the game 's play time is about 15 20 hours	13
0	i love this game ! the storyline is wonderful ! i guess if you feel bored with the campaign just go looking for easter eggs ! but what i love is playing multiplayer ! and someone did bash the multiplayer but there are tons of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and or killing your teammates ! i 've had this game for years and i never get tired of playing online ! actually it 's kind of addicting	13
0	this game is really good ! i have a real up to date computer so everything runs fast and smooth the multiplayer is great ! you can play 1 000 's of people in a huge number of maps and game styles you can even type a message to your team or for everyone to hear ! one of the down points is that in multilayer someone may have modded a map to mess up the game or give them unlimited ammo and you get nothing another thing would be the lag this is where the game moves real choppy or you lose the network connection still its a really fun game	13
0	this game is amazing unlike so many other star wars games this is a first person shooter which is a great touch to the star wars universe i found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle the coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons you have attachments to one gun the attachments are sniper and rocket launcher the single player campaign is outstanding though the multiplayer is so so this game is simply a terrific star wars title	13
0	this game is very goodit jsut sucks u in and u cant quit and before u know it it is don	13
0	excellente juego es una verdadera simulacion de manejo los graficos son de lo mejor y las pistas parecen reales es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar	13
0	its gran turismo theres really nothing more to say i own all the titles in this franchise and i have never been disappointed with any one of em the series is really amazing with every new release it only gets better people should also try tourist trophy which is setting another standard in moto racing	13
0	this is the most complete and most interesting racing game ever developed in the history of video games the best graphics the most cars the precise handling and did i mention the graphics wow this is amazing playing this game makes me wonder what would the next one will look like how can sony make anything that's better than this \? it is already the best racing game in the world it is simply amazing no other game could ever come close gran turismo has always been immitated but never duplicated a five out of five	13
0	this is a very flashy very fun car chase shooting game you get over 20 different vehicles and guns the tv like gameplay makes for a good story line there 's hardly any dialogue in the cut scenes but this was one of the first ps2 games gran theft auto 50 driv3r 30 starsky and hutch priceless	13
0	we just got a ps2 after having no game system at all since the old atari i had when i was 13 so learning all the quot new fangled quot controls is a bit tricky starsky and hutch as well as being a fun game is straight forward enough that the learning curve was easy and enabled me to get right into the action without having to die a thousand times just to learn how to maneouvre as i get better with the controller the game is still proving to be fun and challenging without being frustrating	13
0	cicken little is a fantastic game this game is full of diffrent things like little bit of fighting sports unioform hunt and more the best part i like is the carpool craze	13
0	i guess this is a good buy especially when corporate vice president and chief xna architect of microsoft says so i just thought it was interesting when j allard gave a review of this product on amazon co	13
0	the xbox 360 live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their live account even if you do have the headset the card itself is 50 and the points bonus game and 20 dollars off a new game \( limited time offer \) easily helps to make your money back even if they did n't include the rebate it would still be less than buying these parts separate in fact it 's almost like you 're getting a headset for free ! so like i said if you need live buy also this is the bundle which someone earlier stated was cheaper at best buy i checked and he was mistaking the card for the kit	13
0	this is the kit not just a card a previous review indicated that bestbuy com was selling this for 49 99 that is not correct they are selling the card for 49 99 this kit comes with the card plus several other components thus making it 20 more you may find this kit cheaper elsewhere but not significantly it does what it intends to do	13
0	the game has a lot of plot development and cutscenes if you are into it then that 's great i find i scan for the gist and then move on to the next dialogue that being said all of the backgrounds are simply the best ever put on screen i find myself actually commenting aloud to myself how beautiful the game is the action is good and the plot does suck you in nothing novel in the battle system while the plot managed to surprise me after playing both of it 's predecessors completely worth your while	13
0	for newcomers to the saga jumping on board at this point in time may not be worth it however if you 've already been sucked in by the first two you should find this to be quite enjoyable a few changes and simplifications to the battle system will make battle less of a chore the story line of course is stillthe main focus ofthe game so if you 've been dying to see what happens next to our beloved crew this game will give it to you i however do not recommend this game for those who enjoy gameplay over story line	13
0	with the wii right around the corner people are rushing to get one some preordered it while some others \( including me \) are camping out for it but some worry about how old school is fitting into the next gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction sure sideways wii controllers are s nes controllers but what of gamecubes \? i am happy to say that i have gotten a chance to play around with the wii before anyone else and yes the wavebird receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the wii it looks pefectly at home there rejoice gamers ! pick up your wavebirds and play on	13
0	the bottom of the controller sticks out quite a bit but this does not affect gameplay and other than that it is the same size as the regular gamecube controller simply fantastic \( unless you 're one of those people that just need to have rumble for some reason \) but one slight problem is it just me or do the trigger buttons occasionally fail \? for example in resident evil 4 i 'll be holding the r button to aim but it will quickly go back and forth from normal view as if the button cancels out however this is rare and maybe it 's just me once again an excellent high quality controller	13
0	the wavebird can really take a beating there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine plus the game that ip lay all the time is super smash bros melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing i also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird after 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this but overall its a great controlle	13
0	i bought a nintendo ds so i can play super mario brothers for ever like i was when i was a kid its amazing that they brought the villans back from the first 3 marios when we were younger my 4 5 year old cousin even was hooked on it and i had to buy him a ds along with mario so he could play it after i left to go back home	13
0	the gta series is the best games ever created the freedom to do what ever you want take out gangs with a rocket launcher toss a nade into heavy populated areas kill the police and take their cars put out fires and earn money beat up civilians and take their money help mob bosses pick up hookers with a taxi and drop them off hack people to death with a chainsaw own mansions and other properties fly on a jetpack kill army soldiers and take their tanks and jets listen to radio stations and humorous radio talk shows and ads like pogo the monkey just the best games ever created	13
0	awesome game loads of fun all a guy needs women money cars power \( not necessarily in that order \)	13
0	i loved the game the characers are great the worlds are interesting it still deosnt look outdated and the combat is fairly strategic unfortuneatley the games ending is rather lack luster	13
0	star wars kotor 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good rpg 's it starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game i felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	13
0	i 've read in some other websites that this are gonna be compatible with the ps3 since the ps3 originally only comes with the traditional wires \( av cables \) im wondering if this cables can deliver an hd signal \( hd pic quality \) or im just gonna have to spend some extra bucks in the hdmi cable since i alredy have this component ones	13
0	it works really well and their is no problem with the cable and the enhanced quality of the picture is much better that the original a v cables	13
0	very good cable get it if you have a ps2 and a component input on your tv much better picture than composite cables	13
0	these component av cables make a world of difference in video quality especially on hdtv some images now appear pixelated this may be the game i am playing but everything else is smooth crisp and clear text is three times as easy to read i reccomend these for any hdtv owner	13
0	i was very eager to get this title on import knowing that it was somewhat 'unique' in terms of it 's genre label yes it has rpg elements but it 's something quite separate i only wish there were more such games on the ps2 or any format for that matter this is storytelling videogame style at it 's best capcom clover have produced a real gem it 's an experience like zelda a highly enjoyable slice of fantasy that is sure to hold you in it 's thrall for some 50 hours or more a visual treat and beautiful soundtrack also if you consider yourself a gamer then get this it 's destined for cult status in a word superb	13
0	i bought this game on ps2 for my daughter who is 12 and she has had a ball playing it though there are english subtitles because it is spoken in very fast japanese that does n't take away from the game 's adventures the instructions given are very clear and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks it really is quite enjoyabl	13
0	i will keep this review short the game is a very addictive entertaining rpg great story great gameplay best game i played all year only thing that it was lacking was a lock on feature for enemies took me about 45 hours to complete the main story and almost all of the side missions if you buy this game you will play it to the end	13
0	i love playing this game the icewind dale ii is 3rd edition rules and the graphics are great	13
0	besides baldur 's gate ii icewide dale is the second most fun crpg game out there more action than role playing which is fine with me this is a single player multi character game and you get to create the entire party of 6 adventures the plot is fairly weak but the action is plentiful and i love the fact that you get to develop 6 different characters if you have to get just one of the icewind dale games get icewind dale ii the character generation and development is much better \( not to mention the gameplay and graphics \)	13
0	pros 1 character creation is fun detailed and basically unmatched by any game on the market much better than the nwn creation system 2 graphic is beautiful but if you are expecting fully 3d environment you will be disappointed 3 music is just awesome 4 did i mention character creation is fun ! playing your custom made party is a very satisfying experience any kind of team is playable you can solo the game too if you like cons 1 does not feature 3d environment like nwn2 gameplay is linear but i did n't care as the point of my game is to develope my character	13
0	if you enjoy the series you will love the game as simple as that very entertaining do n't miss it	13
0	you can go wrong very good equiment lots of fun easy to carry the console with most games plus has a great pric	13
0	you know what \? i absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard i beat it on normal in one week ! and this was when it first came out when i was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen but anyway this game was so fun ! i got it the week it came out and that christmas vacation me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game or at least watching me play it i have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old	13
0	graphically this game is a work of art the shiny surfaces glowing lightsabers and vibrant colors make this a winner as far as gameplay those you can even forget the graphics ! this gameplay is so good you could play it with terrible graphics and still have an aweseome time ! the score by john williams is another highlight the music enhances the tension action and drama of this game overall this is the best star wars game i have ever purchased or played	13
0	and three years later i buy the game wow ! awesome ! i ca n't believe it runs so well after the three years of its release ! everything looks and feels great on my xp this is one of the only games i have purchased and and not had to return due to the cd being messed up or some corrupted file so i'm happy ! i thought no one would play the multi player anymore but there seem to always be games going on yep this is a game i would suggest to any gamer	13
0	this is one of the best racing games i have ever played you can do so many modifications to your car	13
0	all of these people complaining about horrible picture quality must have some pretty crappy tv 's i mean it could be that i have a 20 inch sony trinitron and the halo special edition xbox too but i have had absolutely no problems with it and neither have any of my friends \( in real life \) or anyone in my counterstrike clan \( on xbox live \) that have old tv 's and regular xboxesreccomendation if the picture is crappy buy a new tv	13
0	this is a great game for any skilled star wars game freak the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is very fun and challenging do n't listen to the negative reviews claiming the game is to hard the people who claim it 's to hard are just weak at video games granted the game can frustrate but it never get 's to the point where you want to throw the game out the window this is a good game and i highly recomend it to and star wars fan p s do n't buy jedi academy that game is horrible ! what a shame to ruin the series like that	13
0	this game is fun best lightsaber combat ever but it is hard at time 's but when you get all your force power 's it is so f ing fun you can cut everybody 's arm 's off just like in the frist star wars movie cool man just cool	13
0	the introduction isn't boring it isn't long and it is one of the best introductions to a game made by enix se if you do n't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111 ! ! ! 1 then do n't buy another rpg for as long as you live rpgs are supposed to have stories and this one is no different if you do n't like it take it back and get a refund do n't play rpg 's like this if you ca n't stand words go play some gta or something oh wait theres words in that too	13
0	what can you say for katamari damcy except for it 's exciting original fun edgy ! i totally recommend this for any video game fan that love games on the edge of something different new ! p s do n't delete this game when you are done because you will need to convert your progress to we love katamari	13
0	when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games i new i wanted it my littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible i ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun i lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on	13
0	i bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys they play this game non stop basically until they 're completely worn out the game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months ! if your kids have a ps2 then this game is a must have ! !	13
0	so these little fellas are inside my computer they run around all day shouting doodlee doo ! doodlee doo ! i'm thinking that they 're up to no good i'm thinking that they 're plotting against me but i ca n't turn them off they say if i do then evil will befall me caution ! beware	13
0	one of the more interesting video game ideas that i 've seen in a long time the japanimation style is very cool and the gameplay is very engrossing using the stylus pen to perform medical procedures is shockingly addictive and frequently very challenging	13
0	i bought this game because i thought it would be fun to play along with the story like in the sims2 for ds the beginning went well the operations are fun the story drags a little and goes too slow i actually skipped part of the story and just did the operations the operations get your heart pumping and are somewhat stressful i am stuck on the 6th one i have been trying to complete it for a few weeks now but continuously fail unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them in order i dont know if i will be able to play this game any further	13
0	quite simply it 's great though a bit on the challenging side gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title and one that despite it 's 'rated 'e' for everyone' approach will appeal to adults as well as kids it 's not without some light frustration but the good far outweighs the bad ignore the mediocre reviews and pick this one up replay value is in the four different cases as well as some unlockable minigames and a 'touch' list if you like adventure titles like phoenix wright and trace memory \( or maniac mansion for that matter \) then you 'll really dig this game a good solid four stars	13
0	this is a fun game to play i am on the 2nd mystery to solve i do love these types of games this one is sort of like trace memory alot of reading to do in it i am an adult woman my 11yr old son says it doesnt think he would want to play it though	13
0	my son has had many happy hours with this game it came extremely quickly and all transactions were very easy	13
0	this is my first introduction to the wolrd of gta and i loved it ! i 've played gta 3 but it was not as fun as vice city due to the voice actors included in the game which gives the game life i was n't a very big fan of american music \( since i only listen to japanese \) but this game made me like them bit by bit even though it has some glitches in the game i still prefer this over all gta series	13
0	this product is excellent has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time good perfromanc	13
0	if you want to workout at home want it to be fun and already have a ps2 i would recommend this video game	13
0	i love this game ! it 's not too hard for kids to play \( my 10 year old can beat it with max points and finds all the secrets \) and it 's not trashy so parents can let their kids play it they keep it clean for kids with some adult humor but nothing raunchy it 's also cool so us adults can play as well ! i love creating skaters and parks and the kids love the secret skaters like jesse james and the jester etc the graphics are better in this game than the others in my opinion also	13
0	whatever product sony brings to the market you can always be sure that you are buying a top quality product and these sony memory card for ps2 is just the perfect exampl	13
0	this product arrived quickly and in excellent shape thanks for being a quality shop this product is hard to find in a store thanks again	13
0	this is a nice package of my two favorite final fantasy games final fantasy vi and final fantasy v final fantasy v has never seen release here and i feel that the translation was both well done and sensitive to the original japanese version final fantasy vi has been restored to its original glory in this version and it 's a nice change to see uncensored graphics and the original final fantasy vi title with tina \( terra \) in magitek armor i highly recommend this collection	13
0	i love this game i had it for snes and it is one of my favorite	13
0	best fighting game i have played in a long time the characters are coo	13
0	i 've done most of the nancy drew games now and a couple csi and law and order games nancy drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than csi i also had so many problems with bugs with the csi and law and order games not so with nancy drew and a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	13
0	i have played several nancy drew games and this is by far the best one i recommend this game to anyone	13
0	this is a note for those of you were having trouble running this game this game works with xp however you need to have a combo drive that includes dvd writer c d combo writer i have installed this game from that drive and it works perfectly	13
0	this is a great game for puzzel lovers and is n't easy this is a great game to play on stormy dark night sharpen your detective skills with jewels to find murders to solve and a party to save just when you think you have it figured out something new happens even if you play it again and again you will discover something new every time trust me you will never be bored	13
0	i dont know what everyone else 's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome ! the graphics are out of this world and its very suspenseful there 's a murder or dead body around every corner and you get to firgure out who did it ! the ending was the best it took me and my brother at least 24 hours \( not all at once of course \) to solve this mystery it 's a really great buy ! andre	13
0	i really liked this game im 14 years old and im in the high school but when im bored i seem to play this game all the time i dont why i would buy it if i were you ! ! ! very fun challenging at the same time !	13
0	this game took my 9 year old son 2 days to complete it was a disappointment since i paid 30 for it but the action adventure games make younger kids to make wiser decisions overall this game deserves an a not an adult type game but fun for kids	13
0	i love this game my daughter and i are big ratchet and clank fans and look for games with similiar play we found that in the incredibles game it 's exciting and challenging as we get playing it i wonder if it is too easy at times but then i get to a spot that i ca n't accomplish until i do it 10 times my favorite thing about the game is after conquering the first level as mr incredible you then get to be mrs incredible dash violet etc great fun	13
0	this game is simply awesome i received it for a gift last christmas and i still love it the graphics action are amazing it 's not available on xbox if you do n't already own this game you simply cannot go wrong w this masterpiece you 'll love it the main character kratos reminds me of quan chi in mortal kombat looking forward to god of war 2	13
0	my husband brought this game home and i thought oh no i guess we 're not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks but to my surprise not only did he absolutely love this game but i would sit next to him and watch totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game i caught myself saying baby are n't you going to play your game \? this game is incredible and while i am not at all a gamer i'm tempted to try it out ! everyone not shocked by gore \( and i mean lots of gore \) should play this game every game should be this well made	13
0	it 's worth playing and spending hours of playing warning this game is rated mature for sadistic and nudity not good for kids nonetheless excellent graphics movements playability etc etc and etc no need to buy the walkthrough because the game it 's not really that difficult ca n't wait for god of war 2 that will come out 2007 \( which luckily for ps2 instead of ps3 \)	13
0	just so everyone knows i mean there are probably only a few troglodites out there who would n't be able to figure out or at least guess that this oh never mind and do n't even bother hitting the was this review helpful buttons over this	13
0	king 's quest games are classic but why are they not including king 's quest 8 mask of eternity \? i know that it was not well received when it came out \( i personally liked it \) but just because it was not well received they wo n't include it it 's part of the series and should be included as well	13
0	these games represent glory days in the age of computing like classic movies they will always have a place and be replicated though never duplicated let the success of these series be a sign to the game makers to continue making these incredible games and something that needs to be in all caps call on vivendi to give those incredible designers of the silver lining financial and commercial support !	13
0	this is a great game in which yoiu get caught up in the action it 's almost as if you are there	13
0	i really love this game i'm not much of a gamer but i really enjoying playing this one both by myself or in multi player mode	13
0	quick delivery product arrived on time and in excellent condition you have quality shipping thank yo	13
0	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more i do n't think i will ever get tired of it it is so much fun	13
0	i bought 2 of these controllers for my kids because i did n't want cables in the middle of our family room nor did i want them sitting too close to the tv when they played this controllers are excellent they work perfectly they are easy to store because of the lack of cables the weight is fine for small children the range of the signal is more than enough and they are n't battery eaters i use them as well and they are wonderful they are much better than the ones that comes with the playstations	13
0	my son loves this controller it fits well in his hands and has a similar feel to the regular corded ps2 sony controller it does n't have the same rumble feature but has a button to turn the rumble feature on and off overall it 's the best cordless that he 's used yet	13
0	the shipment came fast and was packaged well in all a great thin	13
0	from using only two cordless controllers this one and the xbox 360 's controller i like this one a lot more it 's comfortable small enough to not be too big and just the right weight as to not be too light i could n't ask for a better controller unless logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one then i 'd find myself that much more pleased \) buy this one there is n't a better wireless controller out there	13
0	hi tried ordering g2 gold edition online but it wo n't let me and the retailers here do n't have it in their data even so my only options are to get somweone i know in the states to get it for me or to go there myself and try to get it gothic 2 gold edition night of the raven thats the one email me anyone who knows how to get this to me here in victoria bc alan johnson chumtv com or alj2663 hotmail comthanks a bunc	13
0	make no mistake about it this game has more than a few bugs and sudden desktop crashes it is also one of the most immersive and totally enjoyable games i have ever played i am 59 years old and have played literally hundreds if not thousands of video games since the 70 's this game has it all as far as role playing games go one bit of advice about this game is save often save often save often oh and one more thing be sure to save often	13
0	this game rocks you 've got action storytelling quests your own path linear gameplay and the world is alive people have jobs and work times and play times the controls are a little quirky but worth the hassle	13
0	i found this to be a fun game as well as effective i enjoyed the various activities and truly felt that several of them increased my concentration and abilty to increase my speed i particularly like it when it got to the level where i could choose which games i wanted to use for my brain age tests several of the games are going to require more repetitions before i become skillful at them i find that i continue working with the game instead of putting it down after a short time because of lack of interest carole adan	13
0	i baught this game because i was hopping for a good multiplayer first person shooter for the wii but this was not the case the multipler is crap it is jsut your basic oldschool 1 vs 1 vs 1 vs 1 i am more prone to multi player games like time splitters where you can all be on a time so i was pretty dissapointed the story is great though it really takes advantage of the wii mote and has a great storyline ! ! i jsut wish it had a better multiplayer	13
0	graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any rpg fan	13
0	this game is great both the missions and the things you do on your own \( like extortion \) make this game an awesome part of anyone 's collection i only found one thing wrong with the game when you reach the rank of don everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel for instance when talking to one of the corleone men they will still say something like hey kid stay outta trouble this game although great can still use a little fine tuning	13
0	this game is very good they only add in a coople people to the stoy line but that is cool the game folows the movies well you can even blow up buildings the only thing i dislike about this game is that is a littel repeditave lastly you can get in high speed cases with the cops	13
0	i bought this game a bit late \( 2 years after it came out \) but it still seemed state of the art to me ! loved the story and gameplay has improved significantlypros huge map with 5 massave areas to explore tons of vehicles you might not see the same one twice ! cool new features like vehicle customization endless stuff to do ! multiplayer modecons character customization prosess can be annoying if you leave the game on without pausing you could be in for a bad supprise when you come back \( ie all your muscle going down \) go buy this game you will really like i	13
0	fyi if you enjoy modding to spice up your gta world and enhance replayability you do not want to buy ver 2 0 ! ! ! due to lawsuits over the hot coffee mod ver 2 0 was released with new code that prevents any mods from working if you want to replace the banshee with the new ferrari superamerica or the landstalker with an h2 you need ver 1 0 if you do n't care about modding then sit back and enjoy the ride	13
0	if you liked vice city you 'll love san andreas with more missions car and character customizations and rival gang territories to take over what could be better \? the games biggest downfall is the familiar feeling you get after a while however the new and improved options easily make it a winner and well worth the cash as a note i had no problems running this game with pretty much all options on high i run a dell 8300 3 0 ht 1 gb ram radeon 9700 pro and it flies ! strap up and get ready to defend your 'hood	13
0	this game although it can be fun yet it can be quite tedious you will need a lot of patience to play it	13
0	i know how you feel about the incredibales movie it was incredibale but this game dismays the movie dash are faviorte character is forced to just run around in levels and avoid the enemys violet is just running around invisible elastigirl is probaly the best part of the game by swining around to the end of the level and the father is just beatin up bad guys plus the stupid voice of frozone gets kindof annoying after awhile was n't the whole point of the movie about famile and teamwork and theres no i in team well you are all by you 're self in this playing one charcter per level please note all movies made into games are ba	13
0	this is a wonderful gift for any girl gamer i love mine	13
0	unfortunately xenosaga i der wille zur macht is never come to europe but as the second xenosaga \( jenseits von gut und b se \) was released in germany in november i was very happy so i played it and was impressed of this cool story and gameplay ! i became a big xenosaga fan after that i imported the first part of the series from america now i am playing it and i must say that the first xenosaga is much better than the second ! ! ! ! it 's a great pity that xenosaga episode i never will be brought out in germany and europa ! ! you americans should be very happy that so many rpgs come to your country	13
0	i'm enjoying the game it was in perfect condition when i received it i have n't had the chance to play as much as i 'd like but i will	13
0	do n't listen to the other reviewers this game is great by far beats out sim city 4 \( and i have that game \) it 's challenging to make everybody happy but if the game was easy it would n't be fun	13
0	i have owned the first ds since the day it came out i bought the ds lite about a week after it came out and i was amazed of the changes it is so much lighter and is just a lot better to have than the original the screen emits about as much light as the sun it is like dlp technology compared to a regular tv plus most of the games look loads better sme people say there is a stress crack but i have had mine since june and it is still in very good condition my advice is to you to buy this ds lite and you will have made a good choice	13
0	this is the best working and cheapest cheating device for the ps2 for all you adults who think that the memery card corruption is permanant well do some research ! i can figure out a way to solve the problem and i'm only 13 ! you are all over 21 ! ar max memory has a formatting feature which scrapes all of the corrupted data away yes you will lose your hard earned saves but that 's the price for cheating who ever said that cheating would be fair \? overall besides the max memory portion this item is great	13
0	this is one of the best games i have ever played anyone who is sceptical just needs to pick a controller and go you wo n't be dissappointed	13
0	this is a really nice remake of a great classic \( ffiv \) they improved the dialogue and added in a lot of great items the challenge level however was bumped up significantly the game was originally paced so you did n't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up a few of the bosses surprised me this time through \( i 've played the snes version multiple times in my day \) the story is unchanged however a must have for any ff classic rpg fan ! as a bonus i finally got to play chrono trigger	13
0	this game is delightful the choices of dialouge are great you can turn most conversations in to hillarious situations there are so many options to what class of sith you would like to become if you go down the dark side or what class of wimpy jedi you would like to become if you choose the light either way the game is great and if you become a sith lord and get the power to perform a force crush on your opponent you are very lucky give this game a whirl	13
0	you already knew it was a good game becuase it 's final fantasy probably the biggest and most popular series in the history of video games this one is probably a little worse than the best final fantasy games \( such as iii and vii \) but despite that what you have here is a game boy advance rpg that has graphics that actually are n't that bad and the storyline is pretty good too you just ca n't go wrong with final fantasy games	13
0	i am a fan of arena football i enjoy watching it because it is exciting but this game does n't live up to the real game the game is very similiar to nfl blitz except nfl blitz is better what makes unleashed worse is there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass the most action comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each other up if you are thinking of buying this game rent it first to see if it is really worth the money	13

0	i 'll admit i was a little skeptical about this game as it turns out this game rocks ! arena football fans do not pass this one up ! hopefully when they make the sequel \( yeah i said sequel \) they will include the new afl2 teams tennessee valley vipers rule	13
0	if you liked the first kh you will like this one	13
0	no this game is n't perfect you 'll be annoyed by the dialogue \( luckily you can fast forward through it \) and the cut scenes \( unfortunately you can't fast forward through those \) but it 's filled with tons of things to solve and if you get stuck you can have the game solve it for you this game will keep you busy for a while but fair warning it 's corny	13
0	this games is just great i found funny to play everything in it almost like in the game the controls are very easy the graphics are quite nice and the music too great choice	13
0	i ca n't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars you are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one but unfortunately if you live in the country like me finding a store nearby selling playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible so you 're forced to shop for one online it 's really not cool to have to pay all this money just to save the progress in my video game it 's really dumb	13
0	without this memory card there is no fun when you 're playing a game for a few hours and get really far you will definitely wanna save it without the memory card you will have to do everything all over again with the memory card you can save up and continue playing later really that 's all the information you need pick it up today	13
0	this memory card holds enough game files for any gamer to use but it is way overpriced i did n't have to worry about this because mine came with my ps2 it can hold about 40 files thats about 1 file for each game if you have over 40 games like me you should consider getting the value pack that comes with 2 memory cards if you buy two of the black ones it will be very expensive and you will get the two memory cards confused the value pack is a pretty good deal and you get a red and a blue memory card so its less confusng	13
0	ok first of all i think these are too expensive if i was smart i would buy the 2 pack and save money but i keep forgetting ive never had any problems with these so yeah there ya go buy these if you have a ps2 but buy the 2 pack and save some money	13
0	so if it 's such an excellent game why 4 stars on fun rating \? well it 's a very very fun game but some parts can get annoying and aggravating and it seems as if the different levels of difficulty are achieved by handing you less and less health upgrades which is kinda cheap if you ask me they physically limit you instead of strategicly doing so but everything else is great about it graphics are great not excellent but great sound is great too gameplay is excellent and the story is very well developed kinda on the easy side in normal level though but i guess nothing is perfect go ahead and get this one it 's worth what it costs	13
0	this mic is very durable and is wired good have n't had any problems and is much better than the headset	13
0	halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time this is definately a good game to play if you 've never played a first person shooter also if you have an xbox you should get this because it is awesome ratingsgraphics then 10 now 7sound 10replayability 6controls 10drawn in atmosphere 9fun 9multiplayer co op 9 multiplay	13
0	this is an excellent game people who love this type of game will be impressed great graphics really a step up from the years past i would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in playingt this style of game	13
0	my children enjoy being able to play gameboy games together now with the adaptor	13
0	i honestly hate fighting games i think they 're boring and they do n't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by enter tekken tekken has been around for many years when it first came out everyone loved it it used to compete with virtua fighter on the sega saturn i was impressed then and i'm impressed now all these years later the action is just a lot of fun you really could n't ask for a better fighting game the graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments i love the game and i hope you do as well	13
0	amazing how far computers have come since my old c64 was classified as a powerful machine graphically i love the new stuff but once in awhile its nice to backtrack to the good ol days of 64k memory and 5 1 4 disk drives i agree with the review about the difficulty of the games but its just once again a reminder of the changes in gaming with the times my old c64 eventually burnt up with use and its nice to see i'm not the only one to miss these game treasures included on this wonderful piece of equipment now if only somebody would do this with an apple ii	13
0	the 30 in 1 sold thru amazon is a real commodore 64 computer on a single ship the ntsc version 1 board has 128kb ram and a 2mb rom inside the case of the d2tv there are solder pads that will allow anyone who can solder to attach connectors for the iec serial buss a ps2 keyboard and in some cases a second joystick and some of the wires for the user port product identificationversion 1 comes in a pyramid shapped box has 128kb ram 2mb romversion 2 comes in a hexagon shapped box has 2mb ram 2mb flashversion 3 boards are in a game called hummer of road racing	13

0	i have this monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable \( about 65 for both \) and can say that it 's the best connection you can find for your old xbox however i ca n't really recommend them due to their high prices if you can find the microsoft hd pack get that as it 's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable the only reason i bought this setup was because of their length \( 10 feet \) which can go from one side of my entertainment center \( where the xbox is \) to the other side \( where the stereo receiver is	13
0	one feature that has n't been mentioned much is the cable shielding you can turn the volume up all the way on your tv and you wo n't hear any extra noise from emf also make sure you check your xbox settings once you 've plugged this in once you connect a high def adapter you will have new options under display settings for choosing hd capabilites make sure you at least give yourself the option of 480p and 720p otherwise there is n't that much difference	13
0	it works great great quality great sound and especially great color detail only thing that sucks is actually getting the cables into the tv plugs it 's horrible on most tv 's i 've seen with component plugs the plugs are are built very close together and each of the component ends \( blue green red \) where the cap kind of goes over actual thing you put in \( the usually gold plated thing \) are almost too big so you ca n't fully plug in all 5 of them \( 3 video 2 audio \) but just kinda have to push em in just enough so that it actually works other than that the quality and everything is fantasti	13
0	i could care less what it does for the original xbox what i'm into is the memory card reader that allows you to transfer xbox save files over to xbox 360 now i wo n't have to start halo all over	13
0	i also am a huge monkey ball fan and also own them all and this one is just as good as not better than the others game play is awsome with the new control system and as for the old target game their are a few target games on this one if you dont like monkey target then try paraglider for a much harder and funner game this games has so many games that are fun with friends of all ages snowboarding a few racing disk golf free throw hovercraft battle boxer bowling fencing sling shot and so many more	13
0	this game is tons of fun ! my husband children \( ages 6 and 7 \) and i have had hours and hours of enjoyment from this game i definetely recommend that your children be able to read fluently to thoroughly enjoy the game this game is also great for informal parties as an ice breaker	13
0	this game was a lot of fun the microphone headset works great the only downside is i wish it had more songs but i guess that is what sequals are for overall a good product fun to play with friends or family or even by yourself	13
0	this game is hard but very fun so if you want to pick between fantastic four or some other comic book game just get the hulk and if you do collect your patience because this game will hand it to you	13
0	this is the best jak game in the series the handling of the wasteland vehicles is spectaculur the game is not easy which is good graphics are good as well if you are a fan of ratchet and clank get this game overall i give this game a perfect 10	13
0	when i upgraded to the 360 i was a bit saddened that i would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan but these wireless controllers are amazing first wireless no tangling no mess toss your controller wherever pick it up walk around sounds a bit unnessacary but it is definatly nice to have also the middle x button of these new controllers is amazing also \( although i'm sure they 're on the wired controllers \) quick access to your music friends and dashboard in game plus turn off the controller or the whole console from the comfort of your couch	13
0	needs more shoulder buttons other than that is good	13
0	bought this as a gift for my granson it is awesome many games to pick from and the ease of use is great he 's only five and works the buttons with ease plus you can take it anywhere great price here too cheaper than anyone else	13
0	there is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than dungeons and dragons and that is star wars this game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things it is a flawless game	13
0	i recived kotor for christmas i was skeptical the front picture was strange to me i popped it in installed and started playing three weeks later i was completely into it it is one of the funnest games that i have ever played the missions and the completely customizable characters make this the best star wars rpg ranking up there with world of warcraft and other hyper popular rpgs	13
0	when it comes to the gc gba cable you wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games but it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in gamecube games sometimes it gives you access to secret areas maps items and various other thing depending on the game and what features it opens up plus it is cheap to get and once you 've gotten this wonderful item you will wonder why you didnt get it sooner i know from my own experience	13
0	this cable is tooooooo cooooooool when you play multy player on final fantas	13
0	i have n't finished this game though i'm quite close to it i have to say that this game is quite possibly the most fun that i 've had in a long time i laughed out loud more than a few times was nearly constantly smiling and was thoroughly amused with all the little details not much stylus action but then again did you really expect there to be \? my boyfriend 's highly considering getting a ds lite simply so he can play this game	13
0	i loved this game i played all the way through the difficulty level is low to medium i love games like this instead of being frustrated and having to buy a manual this played smoothly all the way through it kept my interest had good gameplay and graphics did n't annoy me by making me do the same things over and over again i loved it i also loved the mario and luigi prequel to this on gba it 's kinda of a light rpg with action elements i wish they made all rpg 's like this it 's short enough to conquer before getting bored of repetition give it a shot ! it 's a lovely game	13
0	i'm so glad i listened to the fine reviewers on amazon and bought this game it was worth every penny and then some ! ! it has a lot of really great game play and i love how the babies are used in conjunction with the adults to accomplish various tasks i feel like the game play is also very natural for the characters you would n't feel right about mario and luigi casting spells like the characters from final fantasy but it 's perfect to have them jumping and smashing with hammers and flinging turtle shells and as weird as that sounds it makes for a great rpg lots of good side missions too like collecting the beans wonderful game !	13
0	at first playing a star wars game made me feel very nerdy but let me tell you if this is what nerdy is then it rocks ! ! ! ! ! this game is incredible ! ! ! it is very very fun basically you choose what side you want and destroy the other what with gaining the several checkpoints that are throughout it buy this game and put your blasters on full	13
0	in this first person shooter you battle through the star wars battles through all episodes fighting as soldiers on the republic 's side and you have the chance to play as a jedi ehich has more power than a normal soldier and you have the opportunity to do instant action that is where you choose a battlefield and pick a side to fight as also you can choose to conquer a galaxy but it 's really boring this game is really fun but it starts to get boring after awhile so get some friends to play multiplayer or splitscreen also yoda is awesome	13
0	spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played it was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating there are alot of xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old this game was not meant for an adult gaming audience i was surprised when i realized this game is no longer in production there should be more games for the 5 10 age bracket my son loves this game he literally wore it out i have to find him another copy of hero 's tail to replace his old one	13
0	rockstar games are rocking the gamers world one more of the great titles from the leaders in adult games	13
0	i have all the grand theft games and this is one of my favs i highly recommend it and all the others i recently purchased liberty city awesome	13
0	the best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city fight the gangs and police attack the citizens and steal cars ! ! if you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the internet then this is where the fun really begins ! these secrets can give you armor weapons and even a tank \( this is only listing a few \) ! as always parents research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old	13
0	i ordered this for my sson because we could not find it in the store little did i know that i actually saved a lot of money by ordering it here he loves it ! he actually thinks it is good exercise for him as well ! it was easy enough for my 10 year old to figure out how to hook up and operate completely on his own we are very pleased with this purchase	13
0	you can read that the eyetoy is a great toy in other reviews but i just wanted to say that you can use it as a webcam on your pc by just plugging it into your computer 's usb port	13
0	seriously you could just hold up a finger close to the camera lens and just wave it back and forth that is a perfect way of cheating the game is not bad after all	13
0	wow that 's all i can say all the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game' just got it a few days ago and am so impressed with all that 's packed into it ! ! ! it also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises this is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen people of all fitness levels can enjoy this this technology \( interactive virtual trainers serious home workouts \) has got to be the wave of the future ! !	13
0	this game has stunning graphics and fast paced gameplay this game is simply killing different bosses over and over again but dont think im trying to make this game sound bad because that kind of battles in a game like that make this game how awesome it is for example every colossus is different looking and has different ways to kill each of them some a lot more complicating than others and theres os many colossus' that it takes a long time to beat them all so overall this game is great	13
0	pros awesome graphics huge world to explore great story line easy to play you could to kill colossal enemiescons all you do is kill the 16 colossi there are no real side quests except to get power ups and replay to try the battle attack	13
0	this game is really good but i do n't think they tested it enough to figure out that the loading times are way too long so if you do not have a lot of patience good luck with this game	13
0	this communicator is the best i have ever used i own a game center andplay video games for extended amounts of time it remains comfortable tha phoeni	13
0	headset is awesome fits very snug on your ear and does not irritate over time has crystal clear 2 4ghz channel 9 hours of game time and only takes at the most 1 5 hours to charge gaming is a lot more fun !	13
0	i do not own the headset yet but i have already ordered it from amazon and it is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so i will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes my impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous the price \? great price i got mine for somthing like 25 \( buy from abuy4u \) but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset yes 6 hours can last me a weekend	13
0	first things first there is a mute button on this unit if a user taps the power button the sound will mute on and off i'm guessing the previous reviewers who complained that there was no mute button either did n't read the instructions or could n't figure out a product with three buttons on it \( power mute volume up and volume down \) second this is the best way to use the xbox communicator when you have a logitech wireless controller it works well and i noticed no sound quality decrease from the regular xbox communicator	13

0	i love this game it is so much fun even though my wife does not like it i recommend this game for anyone who like mario kart games enjoy the races and do n't forget to blow your friends up	13
0	this is the best game ever ! if you want to play with your love ones this is the best game to have with you can be addicted to it sometimes but that 's a good sign for a good gam	13
0	this games story takes place before gta 3 so it 's sort of like a prequal set in liberty city compared to the original it looks a lot better plus they added bikes and motor cycles and attempted to improve the targeting by using the targeting system from san andreas i hate the targeting but being able target manually is a good thing if you do n't own a psp i 'd suggest getting this game but if you do and played it on that system there really is n't any point to buying this game unless you really really love gta	13
0	this game is the best i have ever gotten i 've got in pin the tail on the ed but i ca n't seem to get pass the hard parts also this game deserves an oscar ! !	13
0	i rented this game before i bought and liked it so much i just had too buy it	13
0	after playing this game for 16 days \( i finally finished it after 91 hours of game play \) i now understand why this game won over 40 game of the year awards it is just that good ! try not to breeze your way right through it though or you 'll miss a lot of the wonderful things that this game can bring to your gaming experience take your time and enjoy it not your average type of game where you just mash the button to attack an enemy this game requires you to think befor you do things it really is a fun game to play and overall that 's what playing games are all about having fun !	13
0	the ds is hands down the best handheld on the market today the black color is a really nice option too i think it looks much more elegant the only complaint i can think of is how fingerprints show up pretty bad on the black	13
0	i bought the white one for my 7 year old son but could never tear it away from his hands so i got my own too bad they have n't invented a calendar appointment software for us big kids the only negative is the white one gets dirty very easily would recommend buying the black instead	13
0	i love this thing it 's awesome the older version of ds was a little clunky and childish looking this thing rocks my socks off ! it 's sleek sexy and portable it 's like an ipod of video games you do n't have to buy batteries it comes with an extra stylus its screen is brighter the sound is stereo ! this thing is super dope ! it 's the freshest thing out there ! you gotta get one sell your old ds on here on amazon and put the money toward the new one you 'll love it	13
0	this title is the tre sequel to railroad tycoon if you loved the old 1990 's original you 'll enjoy this one as well only con to the game is replayablity which is very limited	13
0	i 've never taken the time to write a review before but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game a number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in railroads as compared to rrt3 which is absolutely correct if you are seeking a complex simulation railroads is not the game for you if however you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains then i wholeheartedly recommend railroads it is one of my favorite games of all time	13
0	the best set of wireless controllers i have purchased for my xbox system the controllers are nicely fitted for comfortable use and does not cramp up your hands after hours of play connects great and no interruptions while game playing i highly recommend these to anyone that is looking to buy controllers out there they are awesome looking great for playing halo 2 i use it alot with this game and it is the bomb plus my ranking has gone up since using it while playing on xbox live	13
0	my son is enthralled with this game ! he is learning while being entertained the graphics are exceptional music is great situations are complex and challenging and it works on the mac ! what more could we ask for	13
0	a great improvment on an excellent game only disappointment is that you ca n't access the same titans from the campaign in the quick game and that the titans are n't named i think that they should be afterall they are gods i 'd also like to see a patch that gives you access the the norse giant hero he was pretty cool but the roles of the heros are great and the atlantean army is awesome	13
0	i bought this for my 15 year old son for christmas he loves it and he 's got me hooked the game is everything they say and more ! you will not be displeased if this is the genre of game that you like ! the only accessory that we need is another gun which we have already ordered	13
0	i 've got to be honest this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games i 've bought not that they were bad though the funny thing about these kind of games \( so long as you 're using a light gun \) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms it 's no substitute for real shooting but then again how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games \? now on the game itself the graphics are good enough but the arcade style makes it look well not real but then again that is part of what gives the game it 's charm buy the game and a light gun	13
0	i have this memory card and nyko 's version of the same thing and this one is much more reliable i 've had it filled up nearly to the top with 950 blocks used out of the 1019 avaliable and it never lost or corrupted any of the data great for madden football owners since it takes like 165 blocks of memory to save a franchise	13
0	i bought this memory for my kids since hey were advancing in video playing and were n't able to save their achievements this memory has lots of storage and now they advance faster to new levels i think is the best out there	13
0	if you want to star in a movie about stopping your own death play this game it is as if you are the star of the film but that also means that there are many cut scenes these cut scenes are very well done with great graphics excellent music and very dramtic but there are those of you out there that do n't liek cut scenes at all if this is the case for you reader do n't buy this game if you do love movies and enjoy watching cut scenes you ca n't go wrong with this game i have played the entire game and let me tell you it is a steal at any price it is that good if you like cut scenes	13
0	what makes it special is that it 's the first playstation game ever where you have to defeat your ennemy with a time travel device i gave it 4 stars because the game is too short for an expensive ps2 game \( 2 or 3 hours ! \) on the other hand there are several possible endings and a bonus game the game has a nostalgic atmosphere and the graphics are astonishing	13
0	with nintendo riding very high on the handheld gaming market with the game boy advance they 've also shown their stuff with the success of the nintendo ds as well and a newer recently redesigned version of the ds called the ds lite these stylus pens are specifically for the nintendo ds lite only and work very well for all gamers they are simple to control and play around with for games like magnetica new super mario bros tetris ds and many others the control of these pens are easy to use and handle for all gamers this is a absolute must for ds lite owners price aconvience aoverall	13
0	dude supy gave this game a bad review supy is likely 20 years old with an advanced palette for video games it is best suited for children 6 12 like my two children who are big fans of the lemony snicket movie the game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you 're not a very skilled gamer \( like my 6 year old \) it 's okay because if you die you just restart the task i have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my 5 star rating	13
0	i very much enjoyed this game and i think it may be my favorite x box game i own ! i kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short but it does not make it any less better ! one funny part about this game is the part where you are sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off ! i reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun educational and very durable	13
0	book fans do n't listen to dude supy because he most likely has n't read the books this game is very fun but does n't last very long at all if you like the books you should rent it you probably wo n't want to buy it though i rented it yesterday and beat it today very fun but not for long	13
0	this game is alot like call of duty 2 the graphics are better than 2 the play is almost the same the online play is where the game thrives the online play is better than 2 you get to refine your choice of game if you love shooters you will love this game	13
1	i have bought and returned three of these units now each one has been defective and finally i just gave up on returning the system the dvd player constantly gives bad disc errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc the sound quality is very nice for the price but since the player does n't work it 's essentially useless this is a complete rip off at any price point	19
1	i used a 25 pack of these doing dvd backups and the last 5 or so failed i thought it was my software so i got new software guess what \? my first disc out of the new package of 25 that i bought failed too it 's not my burner \( as another reviewer suggested implying that people should learn to read \) as it 's brand new and does n't require the firmware upgrade they mention they just suck and have a high failure rate so the consensus seems to be that tdk or sony are best i'm buying some now and save myself the frustration	19
1	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products	19
1	the dvds i burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality the only problem is that for every 3 good burns i get one bad one i'm using the plextor dvd burner \( love it ! ! \) but i'm going to try my luck with a different dvd brand the failure rate for memorex is unacceptable it 's less the cost that bothers me but more the time wasted on burning coasters	19
1	please do n't expect to get the cash back from this purchase as promised ! to date i 've been denied twice the second time they said the u p c number was invalid only it 's the original u p c barcode ! i was meticulous filing the paperwork yet they state all required products were not submitted meanwhile i have phoned amaz0n to lodge a formal complaint the product itself is average i 've used better and worse that said it 's definitely not worth the full asking price	19
1	this card is such a disappointment it is soooo sloooooow i use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq it takes forever to copy anything to and from it	19
1	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera it worked for 2 days after that everytime i on the camera it wanted me to reformat the card wth is that \? now i ca n't use it at all i'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon one mistake i made i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card thought it worked and it would be ok i can no longer return it now needless to say i'm too over confident with lexar 's products buyers beware	19
1	as the other reviewer found out these cards ca n't be formatted to work with sd audio total waste of money	19
1	when i purchased these batteries i was very pleased but that wore off after a couple of months i do n't use my camera all that often but when i do i expect ther batteries to have some charge i recharge them per instructions and they do not hold a charge any longer i know monster makes good products but i am a little disappointed in this one	19
1	you can get a 4 pack of emerging power 2100 mah batteries for 9 95 on this very site i did they work great why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries ridiculous	19
1	i wish i never bought this because it was not sturdy enough for textbooks if you put a textbook on it and turn the page it collapses and or tears the page i would n't even use this for a notebook	19
1	we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it did n't have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from if it 's okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up	19
1	bought new around 80 cd player and lcd clock stopped working within 6 months now nap function and radio are all that works if only i could find the damn receipt ! ! !	19
1	this is the worst thing i have ever owned ! ! ! ! it broke \( said there were no cd 's inside \) after about a week ! do yourself a favor do n't get this product do n't buy this brand and do n't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too	19
1	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk \? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader	19
1	the card worked fine for my son 's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother 's wedding and i lost all the photos from that event i still ca n't believe it happened if you have an ipod or other remember to back up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this	19
1	got it at walmart ca n't even remove a scuff i give it 100 good thing i could return it	19
1	before the repair process there was one bad track on my cd after the repair process the entire disk was unplayable took it back for a refund with billions of cds in the world is this the best that the 21st century has to offer \?	19
1	this sd would not work in my nikon coolpix s6 camera \( but the fuji and sandisk product did	19
1	i 've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better \( the cd 's were not skipping as much \) but the bottom line is it did n't fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6 disk cd changer	19
1	some of the worst dvds that i have purchased i would n't waste my money on any more of these pos discs i wish i could return them to amazon but for what i paid \( it was pretty cheap \) its not worth the effort	19
1	if they were n't free i 'd give them 1 star media code mcc 01rg20 2 of 10 were coasters at 4x with my dvdrw ide1008	19
1	i purchased my tv in dec 2004 i did not purchase the extended warranty these sets are have all kinds of video problems myself and other lcd owners have called for in home service the service company is qualxserv in home service they want 350 00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty and can not guarantee a fix take it from me buy some other bran	19
1	the lcd is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency you may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas even then if you are in an are with good fm radio coverage it 's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work mostly you ca n't use this with a cover on and you 'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long the all in one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution	19
1	the extendable arm breaks very easily i had two of them and they both broke within the first month the company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement very poor product do not buy	19
1	i wanted to replace a lexar 1gb with this but i 'll keep looking i used it to transfer a 700mb 2300 file my documents folder to a new pc the transfer seemed pretty slow but deleting those files from the sandisk took 61 minutes ! back it goes	19
1	product mp3 players sansa m200 series sansa m240we received your item 11 03 2006customer comments 11 13 2006 07 51 am when will i get my repaired or replaced item you have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status please respond \( by the way apple turns around ipod repairs in 1 day ! \) 11 13 still waiting for an update on the m240 you received on 11 3	19
1	good product forget about service i e mailed infocus about my faulty projector 8th january 2005it is now 7th january 2006 and i still do not have my projector that 's right it 's been one year sincemy projector stopped working i have given up on it being repaired \( it was under warranty \) and am nowstruggling to get it back so that i can repair it out of my own pocket check this company 's record atthe better business bureau it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints	19
1	i was hoping for a great deal on these batteries but like other reviewers i 've found that they run out of juice incredibly fast i'm amazed that other reviewers have had such good luck because things like my wireless keyboard which uses two aa 's ran out of juice in a couple days of normal use while my automatic sprinkler time that uses two aa 's lasted only a week be warned that these are n't quite the bargain they may initially seem	19
1	the worst customer service i have ever experienced the lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said you got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect \? viking cheats so what \?	19
1	this was a great mouse for about the first year i owned after one year is when all of the problems started the mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it does n't want to connect at all i have changed the battery quite a few times and that does n't seem to help it is very tempremental and i have now given up and am shopping for a replacement so a word to the wise in my experience the mouse will work great for a while just be prepared to replace it in a year or so	19
1	beware of this product it always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer i have another usb 1 0 card reader that works perfectly i upgrade to get the speed boost with usb 2 0 but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy	19
1	this remote is so hard to use and setup the xpress functions do n't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time most of the interaction with the remote is done on the touch screen so you have to look for the buttons instead of being able to memorize their locations with your fingers get something else	19
1	i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	i did the research on this product and it was one of the best i do n't know that to be true due to the fact that the software that they sent me was a demo version that was outdated for use i have to buy another software package to opperate the product that had stated in the description that the software was included one if not the only reason i had purchased it i e mailed tiger com and received no reply if your going to sell something false advertisement is not the way	19
1	i'm so dissappointed in caselogic for discontinuing the hard cases they were great a hard cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside \( that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center \) somebody could have sat on it and it would 've been fine	19
1	i mean seriously guys is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card there is an easier way to do it ya know for your psp if the game is really important to you and you ca n't save it just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again just push it back up and hopefully if you did it right you 'll have the game right back in the place you left it hey it saved me 50 dollars and it can do the same thing for yo	19
1	i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head is n't working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !	19
1	this printer prints fast but the quality is poor consumer reports rates it a best buy but i disagree pictures come out very graney and its almost worthless to have a 2 megapixel or higher camera because the quality will not be seen with this printer i do not recommend this printer to anyone i bought the cannon to replace a hewlett packard deskjet 932c and it was slow but the picture quality was superior to the cannon this purchase was a real dissapointment	19
1	first off let me state for the record that i only buy sony but i have toadvise you against the purchase of the bean walkman i purchased one in march 2006 and returned it september 2006 as i had purchased replacementinsurance and was able to return it because it broke it is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open not to mention the headphonesalways pull out the fm receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable save your self the hassel ! ! ! ! !	19
1	i just cam from las vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that does n't allow for more photos after only using 40mb i have tried to format the disk using the camera and through windows xp it does n't allow it to be formatted bad investment ! ! ! would not recommend the product unless there is a way i can get a refund or an exchange	19
1	very unreliable i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders i find that they 1 \) do n't last get about 50 re recordings not 1500 2 \) may crap out on any occasion multiple cd rw 's with critical material would not read on multiple computers avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks !	19
1	was a little hard putting it together you have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart i am not happy with this product	19
1	i have had a canon g2 since 2002 i used to use viking 128 mb cf cards and had no problem in october 2004 i bought one viking cf512m 512mb cf card from amazon i did not use it until this summer after i had taken 20 more photos and reviewed i immediately found a few images corrupted no matter how i tried e g format the cf before use there were alway corrupted images i wonder if i can return the defect cf card and get a replacement from amazon or from manufacturer \? sherwoodl a count	19
1	heres a new one i have recently bought two spindles of these discs and my computer \( imac w intel chip hardly outdated \) simply doesnt recognize them like i never put in a disc at all the kicker is that this spring i also ordered two spindles of these discs \( exactly the same as far as i can tell \) from which i burned one hundred discs \( not a single faulty one ! \) for a freind overseas i have no idea what the deal is but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs anyone got ideas \?	19
1	the card works as advertised but sandisk does not send in mail in rebate even though i mailed it in with the upc barcode sandisk sent me a post card stating that i needed to resubmit it with the barcode how can i resubmit when they already have the barcode \? in my experience with sandisk i got rebate back on one of two cards that i submitted so you get mail in rebate 50 of the time with sandisk i think mail in rebate is a big hoax perpetrated by these companies do n't trust it !	19
1	i bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether i really expected a better product and durability from microsoft i 've since bought a logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks and love it	19
1	this was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that i have ever made it felt very light and flimsy the definition of cheap plastic not just the construction but the performance was terrible it would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do nothing for about 10 minutes this was very very frustrating maybe i was just unlucky and received a defective one but i would n't take that chance again i wish i could give this device a worse rating somewhere around 4 would be much more appropriate	19
1	i do not like this item because it says it is a 16x dvd but when i put it in my burner it only reads it as 4x something is wrong with the dvds because my burner is one of the newest out there and it is a 16x burner so if you are looking for 16x do not buy this one	19
1	it 's been over 19 days since my sandisk 512mb transflash card was shipped from emartbuy and i still have not received my order when i contacted emartcrap all they could tell me was that it had been shipped i am sure that flash card works great i just hope that i will receive it before it becomes obsolete avoid emartbuy at all cost do n't settle for incompetency your are better off paying a higher price for better service correction any service	19
1	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for	19
1	i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	the machine does fine for quick cleaning of your cd 's dvd 's i ca n't give a complete review of the product because i only tried to repair 1 dvd and it did not repair it	19
1	how do i assign a rating \? as several other people have experienced my unit is also doa i received it plugged it in pressed 'clean' and the motor started up i popped open the cover put in the disc i wanted cleaned and pressed 'clean' again nothing terrible quality control what 's worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty	19
1	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for 7 10 bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my 25	19
1	i purchased this flash card in june for my gps memory loaded fine but only lasted 3 months card lost all it 's memory and was unable to take a new load very disappointed in the life of the card	19
1	as with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter i bought a vector brand inverter at wal mart and it is much better	19
1	this item worked for a while but required fiddling \( unplugging and replugging repeatedly \) with the lighter socket each time i restarted my car eventually however it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets do n't waste your money on this piece of crap	19
1	the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded	19
1	about a year ago i got one of these to allow me to play dvds for my kids on my laptop while travelling it has an alarm that sounds when your battery is getting too low well it sounded immediately i figured that my car battery was not fully charged or on its last legs i had n't tried to use it since now that i'm taking another trip i thought i 'd try it out in other cars no luck the thing is dead does n't do a thing when i plug it in	19
1	each time you replace the battery you have to reload all of your data do n't waste your money on this one	19
1	i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i could n't listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn	19
1	no kidding ! ! the shipping charge on these batteries was over 6 00 amazon does n't itemize the shipping charges on your order so if you order multiple items you wo n't know that you 're being raped by crutchfield until it is too late !	19
1	these xtreme cd cases stinks literally ! i do n't know what kind of plastic material they are using and if they are toxic but the smell is absolutely nauseous i kept it for two weeks hoping the smell would go away nope finally i threw it away other than the smell quality wise it is ok	19
1	in theory an excellent product room for lots of disks relatively compact and attractive however i purchased three of these \( 2 for me 1 for a friend \) i ca n't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers making it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness \( \) all in all a disappointment	19
1	i 've only got this thing to work for about 3 hours and that is not in a row i 've spent hours with this product on several machines and i can now say the hardware sucks	19
1	this is n't a consistent product 99 of the time i ca n't get it to work after months of emails and phone calls customer service responded what a joke ! they told me the plug in the unit and then unplug wait 30 seconds and then plug in gimme a break ! i should n't have to do the hokie pokie just to get it to work by the way their process did n't work poor product poor customer service poor price	19
1	i bought this item not to cool my laptop but to provide some insulation from the heat when it 's on my lap sitting in a chair i'm very satisfied with it 's being able to accomplish that however the cord ended up breaking after a few months targus replaced it at no charge which is good but still a hassle now one of the two fans has started making a racket when i first turn it on after a bit it settles down but very noisy at first	19
1	the is perhaps the lease durable item i have purchased in 40 years it lights up just fine and it is a reassuring led gold but it refuses to do anything with my xd card it worked just fine for 3 4 days then erased about 100 photos all of them irreplaceable cheap yes but cheap junk	19
1	the dvds are a rip off although i'm counting on the rebate to at least break even \( not counting my time \) the dvd player completely fails to recognize them even after extensive troubleshooting with disk management and ensuring my regionalization was not an issue just a poor product velocity ought to be ashamed more taiwanese junk \( i 'd recommend verbatim 's dvd r dl product made in singapore \) as a note i can get other dvd rs to work just fine i have n't submitted the rebate yet so no comment on the veracity of other negative rebate comments	19
1	i tried 4 dvds with different dvd writers and still does n't work this stuff is junk in addition the manufacturernever sent the rebate do n't buy anything from velocity	19
1	before i bought this reader i considered 2 models 12 in 1 lexar and sandisk i decided to buy lexar i bought this reader to use mostly with memory stick i have 2 cards 128 mb and 1 gb i had no problem with 128 mb card but i could not insert my gig card into this reader it just did not go i tried hard trying not to break the card no success it was a surprise for me may be because my card was made not by lexar by sandisk \? i contacted lexar but did not get any explanation of this problem any way i had to send it back and buy 12 in 1 sandisk reader	19
1	what a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service ! i got a shuffle and something happened the second time i tried to load music to make it not even play i took it to the apple store in mall of america \( minneapolis mn \) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it i go back home \( ok \) and it still does not work apple said for 113 they 'll fix gee thanks ! i 'll be looking at another brand ! apple stinks	19
1	maybe if these were high end rechargable nimh this would be a reasonable price but for alkaline \? this is even more ridiculus than the cables they sell you can find aaa battieries on amazon for a third of this price	19
1	but i wo n't because i paid good money for it as you can see from the other reviews the speed on this thing is pathetic almost to the point of non functional when it comes to many small files i had a small game on the drive but it has tons of small files in the folder it took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder makes you wonder if sandisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing stay away or if you really want one buy mine please	19
1	i'm the consumer of sandisk usb flash drives i have used couple of sandisk flash drives \( i e 512mb mini 256mb mini \) before i bought this product performance wise this particular product is not doing good it 's taking long time to copy files from my computers even it 's taking long time to delete files from this disk so i returned to amazon and looking for mini products from sandisk i doubt all the micro products which is having capacity more than 512mb now i'm planning to buy 512mb or 1gb sandisk mini usb flash drive better buy some good one than wasting your time on this product	19
1	overall the recorder worked ok a moderate inconvenience was that once in a while the recorded dvds could not be finalized for unexplained reasons however that is irrelevant now a few weeks ago the unit stop working i does not turn on at all what a waist ! it is out of warranty now	19
1	product mp3 players sansa m200 series sansa m240we received your item 11 03 2006customer comments 11 13 2006 07 51 am when will i get my repaired or replaced item you have had this for 1 week without notifying me of the status please respond \( by the way apple turns around ipod repairs in 1 day ! \) 11 13 still waiting for an update on the m240 you received on 11 3	19
1	no where near as easy to use as my old system but with trial and error can have a decent amount of control over your projects but one interesting thing someone mentioned earlieris that regardless of with system you use these labels can alterthe way dvds play making them stick and freeze and wondering if its the disks burner or what after some experimenting i didconfirm that it was actually the labels i was having so much fun making it might be the weight but i think its possibly the way the beam shines through the disc and reflects off the white label backing dunno but if you all of a sudden start having problems try a labeling tape or a sharpie	19
1	i connected all the cables as instructed but it does n't work the light is not on so i return it to amazon	19
1	these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration ! ! otherwise the speed is no different from a 12x card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the 80x speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration ! ! very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity \( 12x \) at 1 4 the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology !	19
1	the worst customer service i have ever experienced the lady who alledged to be the customer service supervisor said you got it cheaper than other brands what else do you expect \? viking cheats so what \?	19
1	this item was promised to me as a free bonus for my purchase of casio exilim camera but was never delivered now amazon wants me to review it so here your are	19
1	this is a good product sounds great gets good battery life everything you 'd hope for in an ipod dock but it has one major flaw the ipod docking port is really flimsy and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves after a little bit of use the connection between the ipod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down and sometimes the sound cuts out all together if they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the ipod would n't stress the electronics i 'd give this thing 5 stars but without that it simply breaks quickly and no longer performs its only job to sound good	19
1	one of the most essential buttons on any remote is the channel button and it did not work straight out of the box i returned it beyond that setting it up takes time but is not difficult i am just going to wait and see about the next model that comes out	19
1	this is a poorly designed remote i have six devices connected to my hd television set the software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the tv and in my case routinely activated the wrong device when i used the remote i purchased a logistics harmony remote and it works perfectly at this point the only thing that i use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to replay tv \( which cannot turn the tv on and off \)	19
1	i have two ni mh chargers and sony batteries wo n't charge in them they probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers they force you to buy their own non standard charger that probably wo n't again charge other brand batteries and of course this is not mentioned anywhere no wonder these batteries are the cheapest do n't waste your money or support sony 's attempt to bring non standard products into a standardized market soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough	19
1	once again i'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product these are terribly uncomfortable \( for my ears \) and do n't really provide that great of listening experience the frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible surrounds and then they become distractingly uncomfortable but of course this is just my experience your mileage may vary as they say personally i found my apple ipod 'phones to be better	19
1	i am disappointed in this product i was suppose to write to you from the weekend my two rear speakers just stop working and also myremote control i have replace the batteries but stilldoes not work i do n't have any other rear speakers to try on the system pleasy me what to do thank youepiphane flaviu	19
1	while the verbatim has burned well in 100 of my recordings they fail to operate in at least 24 different dvd players	19
1	i had no problems burning to these discs its when i went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore after further research i found out that memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the dvds have absolutelly no life to them my discs started dying after a few months in addition in you physically hold the disc in your hands you can feel how warped physically it has become this is true for all the discs \( about 150 of them \) i can not not recommend this product stronly enough ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	this media did not work on my brand new asus burner even after updating the firmware	19
1	can capture analog video and produce cd rom 's but i expected the ability to produce dvd	19
1	i bought this to record tivo dvr stuff to dvd worst frame rate capture and audio capture of avi 's of the four different devices i have tried completely unusable the software is a trial version instead buy the ads dvdxpress dx2 for a bit more ulead 's software is stable and it 's not a trial version it is also the only analog capture device i have tried that gives a good picture using mpeg capture pinnacle 's dazzle only is tolerable using avi capture which is great if you have the drive space but the software is way too buggy	19
1	i got sucked into this deal about a year ago and can say long term risky cells it could be because the clock draws even when the radio part is off but i'mnot willing to chance it again	19
1	if these were free i 'd still would not recommend them due to all the time that you will waste with faulty recordings it is the discs i must assume since my burner works fine with other brands anyway \( now \) i think it 's best to invest a bit more and get good media	19
1	i had this card for more than 6 months and it worked super in my canon powershot a510 transfers went well too then all of a sudden for no reason i kept getting card error on my computer and digital camera a week ago my sd usb converter could n't find the card either i had really good photos i wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good what a joke	19
1	i purchased this boombox over a year and a half ago what i do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and mp3 playback i agree that it could have been better it would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last you cannot rewind fast forward in the song in mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd sometimes i like to hear a certain portion of a song again but i will have to play the entire song again i no longer have the remote and there are some things that i cannot do anymore	19
1	i ordered the 2 year service plan on may 1st this day \( july 31st \) i still have not recievied it i have contacted them a number of times and still nothing do not buy from this company	19
1	i purchased this item and one month later i still have not received any paperwork i emailed and have not received a reply	19
1	this is a complete waste of money for a number of reasons 1 this hub will not work with any usb powered devices so forget being able to charge your phone or running an unpowered external disk through this hub 2 extremely slow usb 1 1 this device is not usb 2 0 compliant3 it is clunky4 does not comke with a power adapte	19
1	wasted my money for this slow hub be aware that if you want to connect your printer scanner ipod etc to this device think again	19
1	i purchased the dlo action jacket \( neoprene for 20 40gb ipods \) for my wife for use on walks etc around town however the ipod does n't fit in properly the circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod 's does n't the plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and does n't align either so you ca n't press the play button so since the ipod does n't fit in the case overall this product is useless pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case	19
1	i have had this printer for more than a year at first it was a great printer not anymore ! ! it uses up ink like no other yes it is great to have the individual tanks \( which is why i bought the thing \) but now the print head is n't working right do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up and the problem is still there the pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed went to the canon website they do n't even acknowledge this printer ever existed my recommendation is do n't buy this model ! !	19
1	i suffered with this clock for a year because it was a gift and expensive even on the lowest setting the blue glow is so bright my finace says it looks like an alien spaceship is landing in the room the sound is so so and it has no battery backup lose power for a second and you have to reset everthing it is also very big taking up 1 2 my nightstand the final straw was that it has trouble tuning in even the strongest radio stations where i live this morning i finally gave in accepted reality and tossed it in the trash i wo n't miss it at all	19
1	we bought this clock radio got it home set it up realized that it did n't have battery back up called sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks how bizarre ! ! they do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center ! boxed it up and it 's going right back where it came from if it 's okay not to have battery back up it might deserve a chance however what 's the use in having an alarm clock if you ca n't trust that it will indeed wake you up	19
1	i would like to believe that this hub works well but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info \( 5 volt 2 1 amp center positive \) i 've been to two radio shacks and online they do n't carry it i'm upset any advice	19
1	i had to send this item back because it stopped playing cds the sound quality was good but the dependability of this item is questionable	19
1	i have an iriver t10 and there is virtually no software to support the usb plug and play interface that mac owners have always expected pay a little more and buy an ipod it interfaces with pcs and macs equally well	19
1	cases very cheaply made break when opening not worth shipping cost waste of money	19
1	it is difficult not to break them when first trying to open them on the flip side once they have been opened once they do n't reclose very well	19
1	very unreliable i have used dvd rw and cd rw memorex disks on multiple computers and dvd recorders i find that they 1 \) do n't last get about 50 re recordings not 1500 2 \) may crap out on any occasion multiple cd rw 's with critical material would not read on multiple computers avoid memorex dvd rw cd rw disks !	19
1	i have the older larger version of this product however it uses the same software the labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great but the software is awful there is no direct macintosh program rather there are templates they were written for old versions of software and really do n't work right the windows side includes an actual print shop style program which works awfully if you do get this make your own template on appleworks or powerpoint	19
1	they totally misrepresent this product it does not work with macs i feel cheated and lied to by memorex shame on you	19
1	after purchase they want the buyer to call for the service agreement of course you want a hard copy that is why you bought it just do it	19
1	n e w will waste your time money and your every last nerve before repairing your product eventually they will but not without an exhausting protracted fight	19
1	i wish they had a rating for zero stars i bought the fifty pack and had 12 good burns and 38 coasters that 's a 24 success rate i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned 14 so far with no coasters memorex has really gone downhill	19
1	i bought these discs at compusa because i needed a few before i got the ones i ordered online well i just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs i got one that burned good not much bang for the buck i have burned many discs but never memorex usually verbatim or ridata or mam very disgruntled with these discs making coasters maybe my burners do n't like them but whatever the case i wo n't buy them ever again i thought memorex made good products	19
1	i bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied until last week when it stopped functioning altogether i really expected a better product and durability from microsoft i 've since bought a logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks and love it	19
1	being a graduate student and living in an apartment i was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments it prints off things quite well and it is fast it does not however print 500 pages per month 50 100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over 20 which is high considering how often you need to buy them the item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition	19
1	this card is such a disappointment it is soooo sloooooow i use it for my digital camera mp3 player and ipaq it takes forever to copy anything to and from it	19
1	bought this a month ago for use with my dx4330 kodak 3mp digital camera it worked for 2 days after that everytime i on the camera it wanted me to reformat the card wth is that \? now i ca n't use it at all i'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from amazon one mistake i made i threw away the shipping and product packages once i tested out the card thought it worked and it would be ok i can no longer return it now needless to say i'm too over confident with lexar 's products buyers beware	19
1	i record dvd movies as a hobby and am always looking for better media software etc i 'd been using ridata for some time w next to no coasters but figured i 'd upgrade and go with memorex this time around big mistake they skip pixelate and freeze up i have had to recopy at least 5 out of the last dozen or so movies i 've done were it a compatibility issue i could understand but it appears to be strictly a problem with the quality of the media i'm going back to using my cheap disks ! the lesson here is if it works dont fix it !	19
1	cosmetically pleasing is about the only good thing you can say about this unit the included software does contain viruses the included software is a reminate of the late 80 's to early 90 's the tablet itself does not work under win2000 nor winxp under 98 second edition it stops responding quite frequetly and you have to unplug and plug the unit back in to get it to respond again this unit would be great if it came out 7 years ago you get what you pay for	19
1	i just recently bought this and when i installed it norton caught 2 viruses on the install cd	19
1	out of the past 20 burns i have only had 10 dvd 's burn successfully i use roxio cd creator version 7 which does a great job with my cd 's so i'm pretty sure it 's the dvd media not only am i wasting all my money but my time as well i 've tried to lower the burn speed but it does not matter i 'd try something else	19
1	i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon ! ! many of my cds i have replaced for 7 10 bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my 25	19
1	not sure if i just got a lemon or what but would never purchase this player again it worked right most of the time but found that at times it would confuse the change disc button with the eject button i would have to turn the unit on and off to get it to reset and work correctly it 's now about 9 months later and the unit decided it was time to stop working bought it because it was cheap and i guess i got what i paid for fork out the extra cash and purchase another brand	19
1	hi ! i bought my cyberhome 300 in april 2006 and was able to set the region code to 0 to watch all dvd 's after not using the dvd player for a few weeks \( and unplugging it \) the region code has automatically set back to 1 and i cannot change it anymore ! what happened \? \? when i try to change it now i can only choose between the settings 1 and anyone who has the same problem \? thank yo	19
1	as with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter i bought a vector brand inverter at wal mart and it is much better	19
1	amazon fail to deliver item within a reasonable time the item fail to arrive and therefore we never received the good	19
1	the sound was great but the dvd would lag every 10 15 seconds during any and all movies it drove me nuts i had to return it	19
1	this philips hts3400 dvd has all the features i need but its mp3 player is really bad audio just pops before moving to a next song it looks like what philips' people just do in all of their electronics i really do n't want to talk about this any more because william r french and a isaicu all talke about these problems	19
1	it was a great product when it worked sleek design super user friendly sharp image and easily unlock to all region never had any problem loading or playing until last week went completely dead for no reason in the middle of a movie swallowed the dvd with it it would 've been a greater product if it lived pass 1 year at least	19
1	the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine	19
1	i would like to believe that this hub works well but i would n't know i bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac i hooked up my printer ipod and digital camera and nothing happened i called targus and they said i needed an a c adaptor it does n't come with one and does n't say anything about one in the manual or instructions or their website they said i could get it at radio shack and gave me the info \( 5 volt 2 1 amp center positive \) i 've been to two radio shacks and online they do n't carry it i'm upset any advice	19
1	i bought these thinking they were a good deal but now i have to agree with some of the other reviewers i bought 24 of these and one year later i have four left that will take any sort of charge the ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each i also have several high end chargers that do n't want anything to do with the ones that died on the bright side i have several lenmar dlcrv3 batteries for my digital camera and they have been a after 2 years	19
1	o k i purchased these batteries over a year ago and only opened the pack now these batteries will not hold a charge and my charger indicates that the batteries are past their useful lives i do n't know what the normal lifespan of rechargeable batteries is but these did n't last being on the shelf for a little over a year i will never buy this brand again	19
1	to be short the performance is less than great but ok but i can live with that since i have dozens of them i do n't care if it runs out faster but what i could n't stand if that it also set my charger on fire since one of them leaked i could n't imagine what would happen if i did n't come to my desk in time	19
1	c musselman can add 2 more cards to his connector problem i have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna i plan to return it all avoid this product	19
1	sound quality was fine but this cd changer doesnt work well at all i am one of the buyers that had the same problems as many others with the cd changer tried to play shuffle with all discs and it just stops playing after a while it also has problems just changing to the next sequential cd apparently sony did n't do proper quality testing on this product i returned mine and after these other reviews wo n't be replacing it with a sony i hope this is a message to sony	19
1	there are brands i trust and ones i do n't sony has always been a trusted brand but after buying and returning two of these units for very basic operationing flaws my confidence is shaken i should have read these other reviews before i made my purchase but because this unit is a sony i trusted it would be a superior product the problems i had in both units are the same ones mentioned by other reviews when playing cds in random mode the unit consistently fails to play all the songs before failing to load a cd and quitting i followed the advice of another reviewer and bought the onkyo dx c390 6 disc changer i am hoping i have better luck	19
1	i recently bought my second of these the first had a digital tuner you had to get used to the feel after about a year of use one earphone went out the one i just bought has an analogue tuner and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high powered pop \( and around here country \) stations the tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial i ca n't believe sony is charging 40 00 for this cheap piece of junk	19
1	i bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks but i soon found that it does not work well after a few uses the gears began to stick it would no longer crush shave ice stick with the smaller units	19
1	this dvr works ok but when it is recording forget about changing channels it is really really slow and takes like forever to even receive any remote clicks broadband feature is nice but usb does n't come cheap its like	19
1	a clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use i do n't think so i have the older models \( cd clock radio \) and they are nice but the new model is irritating i also have the ipod player and at least the volume controls are on the system i ca n't keep a system that i have to locate a remote to operate	19
1	june 04 2006i purchased this radio for emergency purposes however it seems to be very week i am a double amputee and am confined to a wheel chair i depend on my radio to raise help but i am afraid this one will not be dependable i am not asking for them to be returned or for a refund just letting you and your customers know of a very weak product and i could not reccomend this product to anyone cobra was the tops in radios but something has happened to the quality thank you for listening william hembreewmhembree aol com	19
1	this carrying case worked well for me until i jumped in my car and the case caught on the door frame and the belt clip ripped right off of it causing my ipod to fall to the pavement it turns out the clip is n't fastened on all that securely	19
1	for 20 bucks after finally figuring out that i had to turn my mic inputs all the way up i still ca n't get more than a 20db signal from my guitar save your money	19
1	i bought one of these modules for my dell 700m installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or i get a blue screen i contacted kingston and they said that this module has n't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only ! i would n't recommend this memory for dell 700m users	19
1	i wish i had read the problems and netgear com forums before purchasing this product huge flaw in this product requires that it be restarted daily this requires you unplug and plug back in the ap in order for it to stay visable to your computers second problem i am noticing is that the 54mbps speeds are very rare and even at 3 5feet from the ap the unit is around 11 36mpbs do not buy this product find another company who stands behind there products all of my contacts with them have landed me somewhere in india people on the phone dont know how to help you and email support is a joke latest firmware fixes none of the problems	19
1	this thing worked for two days and then started cutting off songs and starting them over we thought it was the battery going bad but a new battery did n't help do n't buy this item i am not even going to bother getting it replaced after reading the other reviews here	19
1	i have had various wifi networking solutions in my home and office for several years while some linksys units have worked for me more often i have found them undependable in particular the wps54gu2 set up fine but i almost always had to cycle the power to get it to work each time i printed not worth the hassle	19
1	my drive fail after one year and a half ! ! ! this company really suck big time i lost all of my data ! ! ! all off it ! ! ! this is the third one that fail out of four of them i purchased last year ! ! ! total junk ! ! ! never buy a lacie again for sure maxtor external is the best ! !	19
1	i purchased this and shipped to us and finally had it delivered to india in gurgaon iam a musician and i desperately wanted a good microphone i record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this but i wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike the gain was lower than the ordinary mike it doesnt work at all without the battery but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who 'll entertain me in delhi and i consider 70 bucks down the drain lt	19
1	does not work on vista sooooo disappointed because my laptop sound completely disappeared with vista upgrade \( save for the windows startup music \) i thought this new sound card would bring my sounds back might have but it says not compatible with vista i guess i 'll be getting a new computer	19
1	are you serious \? i bought this a while ago to see if it was cool it is a piece of junk u can barely get any channels and even if you do you can barely see them and it has loud static dont buy it its garbage	19
1	the screen is too small if you want to watch it in your car you have to cover it because the back light is too week	19
1	ymmv but my 80gb drive died after 6 months i found this be very handy to have around to transfer large files between work and home but i expected it to last longer than 6 months given that it was well taken care of i'm glad i back up my data in more than one place	19
1	fyi this does not fit the new generation 5 5 of ipods \( 80 gb \) another thing is that there is n't a hole for the headphone jack which is rather odd	19
1	i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work	19
1	after about 3 weeks of operation the fan clicks and buzzes like crazy looking for a better option	19
1	i bought this product as a way to keep a large amount of backup data saved however i have fought with the drivers for days now whenever the drive is working the usb on my computer does not work if i try to use multiple computers on the same drives it crashes \( even with the newest updates \) i will be returning this product asap i'm very disappointed and will not be buy netgear again ! i only wish there was a 0 star revie	19
1	range is very weak probably less than half a mile do n't waste your money	19
1	everything works fine except for two flaws in excel on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings i will never buy logitech again	19
1	i live in san francisco and have generally good radio reception this unit could not receive normal fm stations that table radios sitting right next to it could pick up and i used the fancy dipole antenna on the boston accoustics unit and the other table radios only had an internal antenna the hd part of the radio is total junk sometimes the audio skips and sometimes the signal is lost and reacquired \( meaning 3 or 4 second drop outs \) all in all there 's nothing good about this radio do n't buy it	19
1	de k0unx i know radios i purchased the recepter radio hd a year ago used it for a weekend and returned it immediately even in the denver market with lots of very strong hd signals this radio had trouble finding them i 'd be listening to a strong station and the radio would lose lock go silent and rebuffer before coming back to life this was one of the few hd radios available when i bought it i have since purchased a sangean hdr 1 and love it read my review under the sangean hdr 1	19
1	tried this with two different computers using windows vista got this message one of the usb devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it the mini disk that came with it was no help no response from tiger direct went to radio shack and got one it works	19
1	after one successful printing it did n't work at all my printer is hp deskjet 712c this cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected	19
1	what more can i say than the above \? it is flimsy does n't stay in adjustment rattles around when you move and looks cheap to boot do n't waste your money this thing is junk it would be more appropriately priced at 5 00	19
1	tilting the foot rest back and forth is not the easiest thing in the world it 's just cheap plastic rubbing on cheap plastic so it sticks a lot mine broke in 2 different spots within a month	19
1	i dont recommend these for 1st person shooter gamers impossible to tell if enemy is in front or behind you probably ok if direction of sound is not important to you left and right work ok but not front rear for some reason my hp laptop earbuds work better	19
1	the use of this ac power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless on battery the radio works very well just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost invest in batteries rather than this product	19
1	i ordered this product june 21st and am now told i should receive it by oct 28th i would n't waste my time ordering this product from amazon	19
1	this site is hard to find the ink cartridge i need 78 tri color for my hp 750	19
1	dear sir madam its very difficult to email you regarding things i ca n't find ! or you do n't sell \? i am looking for hp black ink 20 for 656c printer now you tell me which ink i need \? no way you can tell ! ! because you are not selling or what \? you site is very difficult to find ink i need	19
1	overall i do n't like it when the screen is black between scenes and what not their is a lot of mixed in red and other colors from interference buy a different one this one is just not up to the task	19
1	i ordered the a1500 and received the a1000 i opted not to send it back when i read the other feedback on this page i did n't want to lose shipping costs and not get reimbursed \( as the other fellow did below \) amazon is usually pretty good not this time and not on this product if you want you can call them at 1 800 201 7575 \( toll free us and canada \) 1 206 346 2992 or 1 206 266 2992 \( outside us and canada \) 1 877 586 3230 \( canada only \) uk customer service 44 208 636 9200	19

1	the left palm pad keep peeling possibly from the uneven heat this make the protection pad a lot less useful than one wouldthink which is most people buy this pack fo	19
1	not very happy with this product the software on the pc side does n't work well at all wo n't list all my files and i ca n't get it to update changes or new folders this bugger has way to big of a foot print the remote needs a skip function to fast foward through movies hey i have a xbox with xbmc on it get a clue and copy some of it 's functionality it continues to blow away any of the media players i have purchased	19
1	and i was right i should have passed on this it was a pain to configure and then none of the settings would stick whenever i changed the default password it would never let me log back into the camera without having to do a reset that kind of defeats the point returning this item so i can get something decent the money saved is not worth it	19
1	bad customer service its been almost a month and i still have not received this product ive sent 3 emails and called twice noone really helped me with anything neither did anyone answer the phones i dont even know how to rate the item because i dont have it im pretty sure its really nice its just ive been waiting for almost a month and this is getting frustrating with no help	19
1	you 'll end up looking for something better sound fidelity is pretty bad	19
1	there 's a reason this thing is only 6 bucks it 's absolute junk i put it into the cassette player in my car and the sounds were completely distorted the voice constantly skips and the casette sometimes clicks the quality of sound in my car is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device i 've tried both sides but still no avail i plan on returning it if shipping does n't cost more than the product itself	19
1	i bought my monitor yesterday and found to have a buzzing sound at lower brightness \( lt 100 \) just scheduled an exchange lcd	19
1	after having installed the unit for 43 days the suction cup snapped off the plastic mounting this was a spantaneous break while driving sending the unit flying ! very dangerous ! ! tomtom would not replace the unit as the claim that paart is warranted only for 3 weeks ! buyer beware see the tomtom forum for description and picture and other links to the base issue	19
1	i received my mp3 player with a big black spot in the middle of the screen i sent it back and it has been 2 3 months i havent heard anything back whether they will replace it or give me a credit	19
1	i have not been able to get this to work again it was great for the first week then it made my computer crash and now i cannot get it installed again i am not sure i like that	19
1	i bought this mp3 player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a 200 dollar mp3 player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service \? do n't count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product	19
1	nice product before they decided to save a few pennies i have purchased seven but now it is made with out the handle so if that was part of the atraction of this case note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' not ! 5 stars if it still had the handle or if you do n't need one	19
1	a virtual nightmare with set up no help from their support staff on phones nor online q a poorest choice i ever have made in a product ! ! i am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books item still sitting where i left it useless	19
1	this product has a known defect for serial numbers r641 and less \( see logitech website \) i just received my amazon order and it was serial number r635 it will be sent back tomorrow hopefully amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own rather than relying on its customer base	19
1	these are some of the worst ear buds i have heard since the very first ones came out voices are muted highs are muddy and lows are non existant the only redeeming feature is since they are marketed as surround sound \( yeah right \) they have an open diaphram design that allows me to wear them underneath my telephone headset and still hear my callers	19
1	maybe mine was broken but i do n't think so because i could see a red light at all the cable ends i connected the splitter to my sound card a tb montego ddl with a 1' cable and then tried both a 6' and 30' cable to my stereo no signal whatever both the 6' and 30' cables delivered great clean signal when plugged directly into the sound card i even used only the 6' and 30' cables in case the 1' was bad still no signal i think you need to have either a very very strong signal from your source to use a passive splitter like this one or use a powered splitter	19
1	cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear cups but after a few months light use i lost sound through one cup then the other in general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on the batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery i had in there lasted longer than the unit itself very disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected	19
1	i was happy with the noise canceling features not the best but definitely works great for airplane rides really helps cut out that background engine noise my problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by targus \( cheers to them \) the second set broke too in a different place the deisgn of these just is n't very sturdy i'm gentle with my stuff too so either i had bad luck w two defective units or they 're just not made well	19
1	it is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor buying this handheld was a big mistake	19
1	i bought one for my son at christmas and it broke after a month it just suddenly would n't turn on amazon was great with sending a replacement in just two days before even getting the original back but the replacement model froze up after just 4 days and this time i am getting a refund to quote an e mail from amazon regarding this product as it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread thanwe originally thought we are not able to send another replacement so do not order one !	19
1	this would be a nice printer if only i could get it to print ! not to mention when i turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed i 've tried over and over to try to print something i 've checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing if your looking for a portible printer you have other options and i suggest using them	19
1	this product will not fix your disc i tried to fix a damaged cd and it only made the problem worse i ended up throwing away the cd and the skipdoctor this is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work i wish someone would have told me this before i spent money on it	19
1	like other users have experienced this unit is no longer functional after 18 months the wired base is still working but the wireless range extender no longer fires up all 3 led lights poor product netgear	19
1	don't waste your money ! i have directv with hd \( 5 lnb \) and the signal was low signal was less than 60 for some of the transponder signals which caused a choppy picture or no picture while watching hd so i bought these to amplify my satellite signal they actually attenuated the signal the signal strength was n't improved on the non hd receivers that i have as well it did n't matter where i put them in relation to the dish and receiver	19
1	the headphones sound great no arguement there however i was removing the plastic tips \( which need to be changed every several months \) and the headphones broke the company has only a one year warranty so i was out of luck again i thought the sound was great but for this price i would expect them to be more durable i was hardly touching them when they broke off also the earpiece can be a bit uncomfortable at times	19
1	this item is an all around piece of garbage after about 3 months of light use it is stuck in 45 rpm mode i sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode do n't buy this piece of garbage unless you like owning garbage in which case this is right your alley the garbage alley i would n't even give this to a bum because i would feel bad about it	19
1	did not work never clickedno tech supportwaste of good mone	19
1	after buying this product i opened the case after few days as i was out of country to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices however every time i put it in the camera or other devices it gives error and does n't work i could n't use this memory stick since i bought it and as i opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt i am not sure how i can even return it back either basically not at all happy with the product at this time	19
1	the light makes my computer very sluggish even when my laptop is not running off of the battery browsing the internet especially is painfully slow and i am on a high speed cable connection	19
1	i bought this phone for the great features and because i 've had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i ca n't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them	19
1	it did n't match the acoustic wave player i bought there should have been also two outdoor speakers as a promotion for buying both pieces the page from which i ordered both pieces was unclear and i received the cd player with the wrong cd changer i had to return the changer and buy the one that matched the player \( i know i 'll be refunded the price of the first changer \) but by then the promotion they were having for the outdoor speakers had finished i received the real changer a few days later but lost the speakers i think amazon owes me the speakers which is what the bad page made me miss	19
1	in general i 've been happy with belkin accessories but this cable is the pits it lasted less than a month ! i used it to connect my hd dvr cable box to my receiver no crimps kinks or undue stress on it but within 30 days my audio went from spotty to noticeable gaps to nonexistent i do n't like to support the monster cable hype but because of their lifetime warranty i bought their cable to replace this one so far no problems	19
1	bought 4 ! they do n't work the batteries do not last we are trying to return them	19
1	after using these radios two months i can say that battery life is poor a full charge does n't hold three hours perhaps my batteries did n't come in good condition i did n't use them on aaa yet 10 mile range is not true in a normal environment open sea or desert perhaps product works fine while battery las	19
1	after receiving this drum which was listed as having a 25 000 yield capacity on 12 11 06 today 1 15 07 my printer is giving me the same error message drum near end there was no indication when i purchased this product that it would be refurbished i certainly have not printed 25 000 copies	19
1	the transmitter works but it is of low quality the sound has static that is always there no matter what you do	19
1	i knew better but i did it anyway thinking that it would be a good compromise \( we have ibm dell and toshiba laptops and a sony really nice monitor \) no modem port \( not a surprise but would have been nice \) the video display is well you can see stuff on the monitor one of the usb ports is n't reliable i could go on but you get the picture do n't bother	19
1	every other negative review here is accurate the video connection is horrible the mouse runs on a delay of 1 2 seconds and is unacceptable try the competing kensington product instead it 's more expensive but it works i switched to it and all my components work just as though they were plugged in directly in short as advertised and expected	19
1	i tried 3 of these dvd rs none of them worked errors in every burn i used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly so it is definately a problem with these dvd rs and not with my burner	19
1	bought it for my nokia n80 and it does n't work typical ! should n't have bought a generic memory ! ! serves me right ! anyway	19
1	i purchased this product and could n't get it to work on a pc laptop or pda \( cingular 8125 \) not only does it not register in any sd minisd card reader but the craftsmanship appears to be suspect as well i am currently pursuing a refund	19
1	i bought this adapter because i could use the cable that came with ipod \( one fewer thing to carry \) well about six months after opening this item i noticed that my ipod was running on battery one of the contacts had broken and the device was not working anymore i am disappointed but should have expected that for the 10 i spent	19
1	the principal benefit of this product is in the valuable lesson it teaches not to buy the lowest price item without first taking a good look at the product reviews i was never able to get the card to do anything i tried removing and reinstalling the drivers i tried getting assistance through the web site i tried contacting the manufacturer and they never returned my phone call i 've decided to cut my losses and buy a different card	19
1	wristpad seemed to comeunglued far to soon to be considered normal wear and mousing surface was dificult to clean it hold onto the dirt with its textured surface i just couldnt suggest anyone else spent 15 on a mousepad that isnt going to last them	19
1	i put this cover on immediately after i opened my ipod after reading how easy they are to scratch i 've never had my ipod without the cover on it and have had it 3 weeks i now have an ipod covered with distracting scratches on the screen save your money this case is junk	19
1	have a second generation ipod \? if so this is not the product for you after buying my new green ipod i needed something to protect it so i bought the speck nano skintight delux with holster it just did n't fit it i tried but the only way to fix it was to cut part of it off do n't do this i sugest making sure the product detail includes the second generation	19
1	do not order this item if you want a dvd player with a 5 inch screen this item is not as pictured you will receive a small orange colored player with a 3 5 inch screen	19
1	easy setup but who cares when the end result is a very slow video sort of reminded me of jim carey in the movie the mask when he whips his head from side to side and you see the blur that's what you see with this webcam ! do n't waste your money i'm sending it back tomorrow !	19
1	this sucker could n't pick up a single channel not even one less than 10 miles away i live in a fairly open area	19
1	the case looks great and fits well but it 's nearly impossible to remove i had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time i was afraid of hurting both the case and the ipod in addition it 's too wide in the case to dock in my logitech speaker system i might have considered keeping it if i could have just snapped the case off for docking	19
1	although the rs receiver does n't have tv reception \( who cares \) it is 1 2 the price pll digital 3 speaker dx loc switch andprobably much better quality	19
1	bought it for my wife the pink just did n't match anything in my wardrobe she uses her player for the gym and treats it somewhat rough this case does n't protect the screen from scratches \( see most other reviews \) but it has n't fallen off while she 's worn it either about 1 2 useful really on the other hand it was cheap right \? right \?	19
1	the only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection it is nice that it has a clip and it fits the mp3 player snugly but would be nice if it has a clear window to protect the screen	19
1	according to sysinternal 's process explorer both hwi \( hardware interrupts \) and dpc \( deferred procedure calls \) tend to run to 3 40 each while this card is installed both drop to under 1 once it 's removed both remain under 1 while using another manufacturer 's \( usb based \) 802 11 b wifi adapter i'm given to understand that such high hwi and dpc rates often indicate buggy drivers but i 've found no useful driver update info on d link 's web site last i looked that other b adapter btw gives better throughput than this b g card of d link 's	19
1	does not consistently work ! i have a toshiba a15 \( win xp pro \) and sometimes this works but usually it does n't lately it either works perfectly or it gives me a blue screen error and restarts the computer it used to have problems where i would restart the computer and it would say card not found which forced me to reload the driver but lately it 's just been giving me a blue screen i have used pcmcia cards before and never once had any issues d link needs to support their faulty product with a new driver ! bad customer service ! i will never buy a d link product again ! !	19
1	this item was not practical it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	19
1	overall this item works as expected but requires to be reset \( i e cycle the power \) once every 24 48 hours i will be replacing it with another model	19
1	the ends are comming off this cable does n't meet the normal belkin standards	19
1	we got the hdmi cables but we are not sure whether it is the same as the ones on the website the cables come without any packaging and there is no indication anywhere that they are the same brand name items advertised on the website we have not yet used the cables yet and we 're not sure whether they will work or not	19
1	ever since i loaded the targus drivers on my tungsten c the battery discharges quickly and wo n't take a full charge i 've removed the driver with no change the next step was to do a hard reset of the tungsten c and i'm hoping it will take charge i'm taking this keyboard back for a full refund	19
1	it worked ok for 2 months but the kb kept on falling off when i complained i was told that the kb was not compatible with my viewsonic v37 yet it was advertised as compatible with the vs ppc 2002 the worse came when i upgraded to ppc2003 and the kb stopped working i contacted targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their kb drivers for this vs ppc i do not believe that this should be permitted if you sell something stand behind it very disappointing	19
1	works fine on windows xp but does not work well with linux i 've been using linux for at least 10 years and compiling my own kernels for most of that time and still had issues getting this card to run under linux my built in 10 100 nic was much faster than this card would go ended up getting an intel gigabit card that of course works with no issues save yourself some headaches and stay away from this card if it is destined for a linux box	19
1	i just bought these to compare to my pair of v20s and they just suck in comparison the bass is non existent in comparison and the highs and mids sound absolutely tinny any sort of equilizer work resulted in immediate distortion i'm usually a fan of altec lansing products but these look nice and are compact but the sound is not good at all the fact that they are more expensive than the competition is just appalling	19
1	i have this radio and it 's a pos remote is n't very responsive and the display is waaaay too bright \( will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person \) and the user interface is terrible the thing gets lousy reception and in general there is a reason why this is always the lower priced ipod type radio on websites they are trying to get rid of it because it s cks ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	i wanted to convert an hp laserjet 4 plus to a networked printer even though instructions from the manual was followed the printer did not work the customer support is claimed to be 24 7 but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet this product cost more than a linksys router so customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time	19
1	i had a 1gb titanium sandisk cruzer at work fail i tried several times to contact sandisk including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response my wife 's cruzer just failed as well \( the power light comes on it is recognized by xp and the light goes out the system ca n't id the device so it 's useless it does the same thing on all of the xp systems in our house \) i 've tried front side usb connections rear connections and hub connections no dice i 'll never buy another sandisk cruzer and i was going to order another 100 for the office their loss	19
1	sure these floppy's are inexpensive they arrived on time thanks amazon ! ! ! ! ! but the photo doesn't give it any credit these don't come with a plastic carrying case like the photo just a crappy cardboard box ! come on guys wheres the plastic case for these things now they will be flopping all over the place in my desk drawers etc	19
1	i ordered this item because it was the lowest priced of three remarkably similar devices \( all had the same description and specs \) it worked for about 2 weeks and then quit a friend with the same device suggested checking the wire connection inside the cassette which had come loose since then it has come loose twice more so i just do n't use it anymore when it worked it worked fine but it is at best an inexpensive and temporary solution	19
1	i just purchased this item now i'm planning to return it tomorrow one of the advertised features the ability to store liner notes just does n't work properly they just do n't into the pocket without bending and or forcing them in to me the liner notes have value and i'm not willing to fold spindle or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet	19
1	as soon as i received this radio i tried it out by turning it on and pulling the built in antenna up the base felt flimsy and after a few tries the antenna base broke inside the radio i am looking to return this item as it is not designed right i cannot comment on the reception as the antenna is broken ! overall it 's a nice looking unit but they cheaped out on the materials	19
1	machine started making loud grinding noises when started or while printing showed it to a repair shop says the fuser is a toast replacement cost part and labor 300 died just after one year so have to bear the expense poor design quality beware i searched the web and looks like i am not the only one with this problem	19
1	our mfc 8840dn worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that could n't be fixed by the sales technician lots of waiting for a response from brother at their call in website they waited out the warrenty will never buy from brother or amazon again as a result of this	19
1	the buttons do n't have that clicky button feel so you press and you 're like did it go \? the labels are hard to read icons take a little figuring out honestly i use it for turning on off and if i want to do anything else i go up to the ihome to adjust it	19
1	i live in washington dc so i generally get a signal when outdoors using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me	19
1	bought these to use with the xm myfi they are not comfortable to use they put pressure on your ears now the good news they do get decent reception i tried them in my office in nyc which has a northern exposure and it got good reception	19
1	i too experienced the blue screen of death on my laptop which has xp pro on it i had to uninstall the card software in order to stop my system from continuously rebooting on another note the install of the router was great regardless i did n't get anywhere with the tech support group and had to return everything anthon	19
1	this picturemate has been a total disaster after printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again not only does it not print many photos with a true color image but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos do not waste your money on this product	19
1	i purchased one \( from a local store not amazon com \) brought it home and printed a photograph that i had previously printed on a kodak easyshare printer \( my mother in law 's \) the resulting photograp was horrible it had a very green tint to it i then adjusted the various enhancement controls within the printer the green tint remained i checked the troubleshooting section of the manual checked cleaned the print heads and still the problem remained given that the product is still on the market i suspect i had a broken unit i did not like the lcd it is very hard to read i adjusted the contrast but it did not help	19
1	i have only had the batteries for a short time but they are working great i have recharged all three sets 4 per set three times each \( that 's what taks to run my canon powershots2 i2 camera \) all good news i take a lot of pictures and i need 3 sets to keep me going for about 6 hours but i know that i need another 3 sets to really keep me in the field for the day i do alot of back packing and long walks on the beaches these batteries are really good they have never let me down as of yet that 's why i will be getting more all i can really say is byem	19
1	it says it 's an a v dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv i'm really pissed about this product what a waste ! a v cables that sell for 20 are incredible they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a v inputs of my tv	19
1	i was very disappointed when i received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables cables that you can pick up at radio shack for much cheaper just ridiculous the airport express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and go to your local radio shack for the mini rca cable and a quick search online for the optical to mini	19
1	i dont like this mouse i brought and never work its useles	19
1	klear screen has to be the absolute worst product i 've ever used it has nearly ruined my 2001fp i was stupid and used it on my primary display first instead of using the 50 50 isopropyl alcohol water mix that 's far superior to klear screen products my lcd now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out my 3 year old laptop 's display looks nearly perfect because i only used the 50 50 solution on it my 2001fp looks horrible now	19
1	this remote controller was quite a dissapointment i am using two other philips magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better this one does not look like the picture \( which looks more like the 425 model \) it does not cover the equipment i have \( while the 425 model does \) it 's learning mode is flaky and unreliable to say the least the range is shorter then that of the 425s conclusion this would make for a nice ornament \( it does look nice and if you are lucky you may be able to control some devices	19
1	i bought this product to replace a previous hp all in one printer i had this is by far the worst printer i have ever owned it does not like photo paper it is unreliable and it goes through ink quickly as the cartridges are tiny and overpriced do yourself a favor don't buy this product ! ! !	19
1	merchandise returned to vendor by shipper as damaged in shipment cancelled order ! !	19
1	the only good thing i can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works but software installation is long and tedious \( and took three times on one laptop to get to work \) installed drivers cause my pc to take 45 seconds longer to boot and sometimes \( about 30 \) stop the shut down sequence \( i have to click end in a dialogue box \) the ink runs out \( even the big black one \) amazingly quickly and replacements are 54 at costco it seems you gotta get only hp cartridges as third party cartridges fail i 'll never buy another hp printer	19
1	this unit replaced my old aio 7410 which i loved this one just feels cheap the construction is cheap parts are loose and it feels like a child 's toy not an office tool given the choice i would not buy another one	19
1	i dont like this mouse i brought and never work its useles	19
1	they listed the 49x and they shipped the 49a \( standard capacity \) so like everyone else who bought this product it is really the standard capacity toner that you are going to get you may get it at a lower cost elsewhere check around	19
1	looks and feels nice but when dropped on concrete or ceramic floors ir will snap both broke the same way within a few weeks i'm looking for the original all plastic stylus	19
1	the leather case works great easy access to buttons space for business cards and sd cards ah ! the smell leather five stars	19
1	the shape conforms perfectly to the designer 's hands but unless you share the same dna i 'd avoid this product i 've used many of these over the years and this is the only one i struggled with constantly shifting it to get it 's high and low points in a place that was tolerable i finally reversed it pointing it towards me and it worked a little better this just needs to be a simple pad instead they 've overdesigned it as a gimmick	19
1	i do n't even use it anymore did n't think it was that great i got a gel rest from fellows a lot better	19
1	i am on my 2nd unit and both lockup after a short time neither the remote nor the front buttons will work when it locks up you have to unplug it and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes maybe longer it works good when it is working	19
1	would of been great to receive so i could of gotten some use of i	19
1	this memory did not work still have yet to receive refund from seller	19
1	what were they thinking \? or are they thinking at all \? sonic stage is a piece of crap it freezes hangs and very very user friendly \? \? \? \? since you need their software to load the music i would stay away from this player as far away as possible pros nice sound quality cons everything else my recommendation is go for creative usb players it 's very good quality and better battary life with creative players you just drag and drop files and you done with it i see why sony is failing in mp3 players market	19
1	i have used this type of inexpensive wireless mic before and the others i tried had much better sensitivity you have to touch this mic with your lips to be herd there are better choices even in this price range	19
1	got the phone and found out that in order to mount it to the wall i need to purchase a 4 00 part and pay 5 00 shipping and taxes now all the specs say wall mountable not wall mountable with an extra purchase ! ok 8 10 is n't going to break me but somewhere it should state that you need to get an extra bracket in order to mount it on the wall ! so since i ca n't mount it on the wall i have n't used it yet ! have to wait a week or so for the wall mount bracket to come in	19
1	easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working horrible customer service ! will never buy from this company again !	19
1	the unit requires registration and an authorization number from the manufacture before maps can be loaded into the compact flash card this requires determining the cf card id when registering instructions for this procedure are very poor and navigating magellan 's web site is tricky at best if you enter the cf id incorrectly you cannot store any maps in the unit even if you are provided an authorization code for the cf card beware	19
1	i went online to amazaon a site i trusted to locate an hd radio for my desk at work this was listed as an hd radio only after i received it opened it and plugged it in did i discover it is not an hd radio both the 3rd party vendor and amazon claim i have no right to a refund the fcc calls this fraud and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation	19
1	5 ml for 20 i would refuse to buy any printer that used this cartridge on principal die in a fire hp	19
1	i liked the md671 for the home office so i thought the md7161 would be a good upgrade for the home phone not so the handsets intermittently cut out when the person on the other end is speaking i tried all the troubleshooting recommendations with no change in the problem if you cannot hear the entire conversation that sort of makes the phone unusable right	19
1	this thing is a piece of junk it stops working in between of a song for no reason u can get a better mp3 player if you are spending this much	19
1	rarely do i write a review but this product is so bad i had to expecting sony electronics to perform well what a disappointment this one is a bummer save your money there has got to a better under cabinet radio out there while the concept is good and the design sleek do n't be fooled by the packaging nothing works well fm reception is poor sound is terrible controls are not intuitive to top it all off a year after purchase \( yep the warrantee just expired \) the cd player decided to only play the first track of any cd inserted forget listening to the rest of it this product is really zero stars i 've tossed the whole works in the garbage	19
1	it 's too small and signal is too weak the life of battery is too short not recomment to buy this you can find some other model better quality	19
1	check 10 cases at least 6 are broken in new box i do n't want to waist my time to check the remain 15 pieces	19
1	hard to believe this product is still being sold when it 's not even friendly with the current hot selling ipods also the claims of good design i feel are overstated finally the speakers are weak and sound like it wo n't be long until they 're shaking this may influence what music you 'll end up playing through the system all said though i 'd be happy with it for the price if only they 'd update it to fully handle my ipod	19
1	my printing problems began two months after warranty expiration i tried every troubleshoot i could find three times what a beautiful machine it does everything very well it even looks great sitting there on the desk but what if it stops printing then what good is it \? i finally gave up and bought something else	19
1	i ordered this for christmas from a marketplace seller it was defective and assumed i would have to deal directly with philips to get a replacement after seven weeks i still do not have a replacement from them their customer service people keep telling me 10 15 days and i have no recourse i also thought the unit was complicated to use and would gladly obtain a refund if i could or even get the unit i would not recommend buying this or any other philips product to anyone their customer service is the worst i 've ever dealt with i also had to pay the shipping to return their defective dvd player	19
1	this thing was a nightmare for us so much in fact that we returned it it never played the movies correctly and even scratched every movie we played in it do not waste your money on this thing	19
1	this phone has about a 20 foot range before it starts cutting out it has great features but you ca n't really move all about your home	19
1	my friend has this cord to connect his ipod to his stereo and it works great great sound good ease of use etc i wanted one so i went to bestbuy today and got one by rca that sounds just as good for 7 99	19
1	you do n't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel \? there 's no gold inside ! so there 's no need for oxygen free gold tipped multi sheilded super mega supreme cables if you do n't believe me buy this cable and a no name cheapie compare them for yourself you will see no difference with analog signals a good quality cable may make a difference \( although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope \)	19
1	man were we diappointed with this ge phone ! we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we could n't figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a 10 year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it 's unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere \? \? \?	19
1	nice basic phone i 've used it happily for two years until the battery died what 's the deal with the batteries on new cordless phones \? my 5 8ghz toshiba wonder died after less than 2 years while my trusty at t from mid 90s keeps on ticking	19
1	this is an excellent item for anyone on the go who has an ipod nano no longer do you need to carry those cumbersome cd 's around or get distracted while driving when a cd ends and you need a new one why pay the big bucks for a cd changer player when all you need is this an ipod nano	19
1	the price and some positive reviews led me to purchase this item but after only about 1 000 pictures all i got was corrupted data i had the card professionally tested to ensure it was the card and nothing wrong with my camera it definitely showed the card was the problem luckily i had recently done a download wo n't trust my pictures to this brand again	19
1	this was the worst electronics puchase i 've ever made when i first got the mini it was great looked nice and sounded great within about 6 months battery life started to go way down after a year it was down to nothing did n't work properly would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes if you 're going to take a chance on an ipod definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one	19
1	i had my pink ipod mini since feb 2005 it was fine until it died the next year on the exact day i got it and the warranty ran out i got it repaired at an apple reseller and then it died again on the warranty expiration date what is it with the ipods \? it 's like they have a self destruct inside ! \)	19
1	i 've been looking for this style of phone for a while looks great works great but it 's so tiny as to be a pain in the rump to use it 's both more narrow width wise and length wise than my samsung sph a900 when the samsung is fully opened this is still a smaller phone i want a small sleek mobile phone but this phone is impractical for using for long periods at home if it we 're 1 3 larger it 'd be excellent maybe a great phone for women also it does not have any plugs for headsets i am returning mine to amazon	19
1	i do not leave feedback of any kind on amazon com but this time as i was listening to my car audio today i was compelled to leave one for others this product is probably the worst of any electrical equipments i bought for mp3 player audio system its sound reproducing transmission from mp3 player to car audio is of inferior quality it does not balance well the low high frequency sounds resulting in dampened sound with absolutely no clarity mine worked ok for the first several hours i assume i think it damaged the speaker and it now sounds like it 's going to rip apart someone else left review explaing this trouble which i ignored which was a mistake again do n't buy	19
1	my wait has been 17 weeks and i received my monthly email today pushing out the delivery date another 30 days one big difference ! ! ! ! the item is now listed as available but for more money than i agreed to pay back in november if this is amazon's way of making me take a walk and give circuit city my it worked	19
1	this is a terrible product if you can get it to print the labels look great but it will only print a few labels before stops for no reason that i can find i get an error that it did n't print but no reason why i 've installed on two different pcs one is brand new and same thing happens software is also pretty useless it also prints many blank labels which gets quite expensive the online help is a joke and the technical support take 48 hrs to respond	19
1	i was expecting at least a degree worth of difference it did not help at all ! absolute waste of 50 dollars	19
1	had this set of speakers for close to a year now they really are nothing special for the price one problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift \( if you lock in a signal at all \) ! they do come with power cord to plug each speaker into ac i have outside wiring so this is no trouble two if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out if you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone and mounting them in a high traffic area \( i mounted mine high above head level \) don't purchase them	19
1	these speakers in one word suck i made the mistake of buying them because they were so cheap i guess i forgot the old adage you get what you pay for did n't i \? they worked okay when i first installed them in a week i got bad signals and the speakers did n't work properly worse purchase i 've ever made ! ! do n't make the same mistake i did please ! spend the extra money and get quality speakers	19
1	this product does not hold the smaller ipods well at all only should be bought by people with the bigger model ipods	19
1	i use a plastic water bottle and the only part that is kept cold is the bottom	19
1	i own a magellan meridian marine unit just found out that you can only get 1 access code per program i purchased 2 64 meg cards in hopes of downloading more than 1 map per card not only can i not down load more than 1 map i cannot get an access code for additional cards lost money all the way around magellan offered me the opportunity to buy the blue nav xl charts at 179 00 but low and behold they come with the same defect of 1 unlock code per program i was a believer in magellan but switching to garmin today ! david	19
1	i bought this item because amazon never had the 3m model i wanted in stock so i settled for this one that was a big mistake the wheels on this stand are only about 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable the spring steel friction fit makes it difficult for one person to attach or remove this stand from the cpu it is really a two person operation finally if your cpu has a side access panel you will have to remove it from the stand to gain access since the stand uses a pressure fit to hold it to the computer take a look at the 3m cs100 stand i think it is a much better design	19
1	this item will not work with pixma mp810 printers none of the photo pigments are compatpable with this unit i am now the proud owner of a cli 8pc ink tank that is completely useless to me i suppose it 's my fault since when i looked at these reviews several other people had the same problem let all other buyers be aware and not make the same mistake	19
1	do not buy this unit i have tested the vosky iogear and now us robotics and they are all junk while the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate i do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit and why are the so small ! \? the are so small as to be practically useless the iogear unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons bottom line wait until someone comes out with a quality item or shell out big bucks and buy a polycom and the computer calling kit that is available through polycom \( even the polycom computer calling kit is analog ! what is the problem ! \?	19
1	very simply put the sound is wonderful the design stinks i too crazy glued the rubber earcups to the plastic earphones that lasted 2 days and they fell off i do n't know what bose is thinking clearly they are not doing any end user testing update bose has issued replacement earcups which apparently do n't fall off pretty cool i gotta upgrade my rating from 2 to	19
1	this item was not practical it looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	19
1	this product is great the only problem i have is that upon downloading the drivers for this item i get a warning from my server stating that this devise does not have an id certificate and it advises me not to use this item for it may damage my computer i want to use this item but i am afraid to please verify you certificate so i can complete my downloa	19
1	this is a recorder with many nice features but mine lasted only a few dozen hours \( but did make it beyond the very short warrenty \) it was well cared for and still does not have even the tiniest scratch but it simply did not last long for the price i expected a durable and well built machine i was very disappointed and could not personally recommend it	19
1	if your router is not by d link and particularly if you use wpa encryption with that router do not purchase the dgl 3420 i have tested it with both the linksys wrt54g and the smc 2804wmbp g and wpa fails with both of them d link technical support in fact has confirmed that they know the adapter does n't work using wpa with the wrt54g besides for significantly less money you can get a wireless bridge with a lot more functionality after this product failed for me i purchased the netgear wgps606 which can connect four items \( x box computer whatever \) to your wireless network and two wireless print servers all for 20 less \( on amazon \)	19
1	when this jumpdrive was plugged into my windows 2000 system the software that it loads corrupted the boot sector of my hard drive the lexar technical support was no help at all they told me to reinstall my system luckily the computer repair person i hired was able to recover my data files before the os was reinstalled lexar would not cover one dime of my repair cost i will never purchase one of their product again	19
1	when it worked it did as described but twice it stopped functioning and all data was lost now when it is connected the computer fails to recognize it there are many better more reliable brands such as the sony micro vault which i have now nevertheless i would n't put anything on these that i did n't have backed up these drives heat up if you leave them connected to the computer heat will cause them to fail faster	19
1	i bought two lexar thumbdrives over other brands partially based on their rebate offers despite my methodical record keeping and submission i simply got post cards saying that i did not meet the rebate requirements \( in place of the rebate checks \) the first time it happened i thought it was oh well my fault but the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission this is simply frank fraud by lexar on a smaller scale therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further i hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again	19
1	this is the worst pice of electronics i ever bought started falling apart after few days only battery life is a joke software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it wo n't work with os prior to xp you will find that out after you 're done installing it mediocre performance do n't waste your money on this one	19
1	what a lousy battery used it on my clock and it leaked i would never use it again	19
1	i value the amazon product reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback i purchased this phone from home depot for 69 95 i am returning it today it is to large for comfort the reception is bad the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses i could go on	19
1	while i'm driving this thing does n't work at all there 's tons of static and the music cuts out all the time the only time this fm transmitter works is when my car is still maybe it 's because my antenna is on the back of my rear window and the transmitter ca n't reach it overall i 'd say this product is garbage	19
1	this junk absolutley ruined an otherwise mildy scratched cd avoid at all costs unless you want to completely destroy a cd what was in that bottle toilet cleaner	19
1	i bought this product and was very disappointed by it not only did it damage my head to my c d writter it also destroyed my hard drive in the process eri	19
1	this player is junk it would not play music for more than two hours before going dead when i called toshiba the person that i talked to claimed he was n't aware battery life was even a problem i directed him to read some of the reviews on c net which i discovered after i bought it \( my fault \) it was finally returned and the battery was replaced now \( after two weeks \) it wo n't even hold a charge i'm returning it and will not recommend this to anyone	19
1	i 've had these speakers for three years now hissing popping not holding signal all that has been true from day 1 and tonight one of the speakers just would not turn on the power supply was n't the problem it 's something inside the speaker box and something that apparently cannot be fixed so my other one will be mono until i can come up with an alternative solution oh well	19
1	we wanted the zoom and missed the fact that this one does not have the zoom the reason i give two stars is because of beach camera 's return policy they grudgingly allowed me to return it as a one time courtesy with a restocking fee i wish amazon would tag the vendors so we could easily see if we were buying from this type of company	19
1	i have gone through 4 pairs in 4 months because they keep breaking one thing after another either one ear stops or they both stop in the same hour ! ! ! i would n't dare unless you can return them easy	19
1	i bought the ear buds to replace the ones that came with my ipod i used it for about fifteen minutes and then the left earbud would not transmit any sound sending these ones back i must say that the earbuds kept outside sound out very well \( much to my mom 's dismay she could n't fuss at me p \) oh well	19
1	the description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in rugged conditions in reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber i suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling	19
1	has anyone else experienced the following \? used the first twenty or so in a stack of 100 without any problems then have run into \( so far \) a run of at least 30 defective discs after the remainder sat unused for a few months after various attempts to narrow down the problem i tracked it down to the blank cd rs i had exactly the same problem occur with another brand which was replaced with these tdks is there some unwritten shelf life for blank cd rs or am i just unlucky \?	19
1	creating a dvd using imovie to idvd even on a powermac g5 quad \( superfast supergreat ! \) is a 4 5 hour process a 10 15 failure rate due to poor media quality is unacceptable ! the 'quality control' at memorex sucks ! it is not so much the cost of the bad dvds but there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5 8 out of every 50 i have used causing a failure to burn after a very lengthy set up process i will be using verbatim blank media from now on !	19
1	i would not buy this again the edge of the pouch impinges on the earphones connection and already wore out i set of earphones the attachment to a belt is tricky to use cant be done one handed and frequently unlatches when i am moving around i am in the market for a better one	19
1	i bought the kx tg5571 and an extra handset after being so pleased with it 'spredecessor kx tg5471 the 5571 handset does not have a flash button ! what you have to do instead is press the speakerphone button wait foroptions to appear on the screen and then press a different button toaccess the flash function and there is no way to figure that out whilelooking at the handset why	19
1	this was the top rated system by consumer reports i returned it the sound quality of the message i recorded as a greeting sounded awful as did the sound of the messages i received tried to record my greeting a number of ways but they all sounded awful	19
1	this portable tv sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design they do n't tell you that there is no antennea nor that the tv will not work without an antennea ! the portable dvd player is great the tv is horrible when we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken don't buy this for the tv ! we ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in this one was a total waste of money	19
1	the product does not work in my view i have to review every card and have to manually correct the extracted information in 95 of the cases it is not much different than entering the information manually the character recognition software has a long way to go to be effective does not even recognize that wireless is the mobile phone number one would think that they would get it right after all these versions and years the only good thing is once you scan the cards you can throw them away but still have to spend the same amount time entering the information by hand	19
1	i bought this product to help cleaning the lense of my auto cd player i tried it for at least 10 times but no luck wet clean the lense manually is the best way but that will include getting the player out from the dash board	19
1	i owned this product for about one week very nice little piece which i can take to work or jogging but today when i am copying some files to it from my computer it stopped working even reset did n't work so i will return it for a refund and try different products	19
1	i purchased this to work with my xbox 360 i wanted to try this cable type with my new onkyo 7 1 home theater since i was using the old composite for sound i heard more disortion and fuzz then if you but a soda can in a blender i qucikly ran to best buy to buy a monster fiber optical cable it was about 50 00 dollars more but then the sound was incredible i could n't beleive what i was hearing i gave it two stars since the cables build was so so but not half as thick as monsters \( maybe i got a bad model give it a shot it 's only a couple dollars \)	19
1	this is the same unit that hp sells but has lite on do its support great unit for about a month support is not good	19
1	i was not aware until purchasing that the u3 smart drive by kingston would not run just any software but only certain programs therefore it is mostly useless to me however i will use it as a general back up thumb drive	19
1	very disappointing ! i was hoping i could at least get one or two viewable network affiliate vhf stations instead the best the antenna could pull in was color enhanced snow and sound laced with static tried all three antenna hook up options in fact my set pulled in the same signal with or without the antenna	19
1	please do n't be fooled by it 's inexpensiveness i am a victim of it i already bought this card and within 2 weeks i started getting read and write errors i formatted the card and it now has 2 mb of bad sectors unlike the other reviewer i did had 2 gb to begin with but i think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap it is not at all reliable now i am contacting their customerservice to replace this card for me	19
1	i experienced what seemed to be a common problem for many people that have purchased av cables for the ipod i was able to get the audio but no picture was available despite following the advice of other reviewers to set my tv out signal to on it did n't help that no manual was included in the box to assist with troubleshooting	19
1	i bought this last christmas for my three year old and five year old thesound of the piano is a little off but all in all the piano is nice for the price the leg of the stool breaks very easily do n't buy unless you can fix	19
1	i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel 15 klh speakers that sound better than this no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end after a year of misery on my ears i 've replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost 20 more and the difference is not even comparable do not buy this or any bose product at all save your money and buy paradigm b w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money 's worth	19
1	believe me this is not worth it ! get a kensington i already wasted my money on this do n't buy it horrible signal to noise ratio poor reception cannot modulate to more than 4 frequencies does not work	19
1	i'm usually a big linksys supporter this is an exception this device is a joke not a very funny one the first thing i was told when i called for support was it most likely would n't work with my printer \( canon mp950 \) i spent several hours trying to get a linksys router to see this thing with online support do n't waste your time	19
1	i followed the install instructions to the letter but the install program started giving me an error that i could n't get past i downloaded the latest install from the linksys web site and got past the point where i had been getting the error but i could n't get the print server to connect to my wireless network when i had the print server connected to my network via an ethernet cable it detected the attached printer but could n't even print a test page successfully this product was a complete waste of time	19
1	this was my first and only purchase of a linksys product i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer then hooked it up to another printer only to have it die just out of warranty a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer does n't even stand behind it	19
1	syntax clearly states that their warranty is only good for the origninal purchaser i got my daughter one as a gift gave it to her bran new in the factory sealed box and syntax refuses to honor the warranty \( and yes i calld everywere and tried everything \)	19
1	i just bought these matte labels when i printed a photo i noticed that photos come out at the ultra lowest quality and the worst part is that everything printed on these labels smudge when fingers are lightly run over the labels has anyone experienced this \? please share your story	19
1	i did not receive the correct product that i ordered i informed the seller and he stated that i would need to resell on ebay myself very disappointed with his service kell	19
1	long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual fm reception this is in town trying to receive a major station i am packaging this up and its going back today this is my second try with sony that has miserably failed guess maybe i should be looking at another mfg	19
1	i purchased this headset to wear to the gym to tune into their tv 's to watch programs rather than listen to music reception was horrible ! ! ! while i was in the gym i tried just listening to the radio and could n't even get that to come in clear the only time it was partially clear was if you were standing outside and it was clear skies ! not impressed at all ! i will be returning this and maybe buy the 12 generic set instead	19
1	i also had the model before the m85v and got great reception this new model gets terrible reception i still have my old model and put the old one next to the new one and it was like night and day with the reception do n't waste your money on this model !	19
1	reception is only acceptable if you are seated with the headphone antenna adjusted to maximize signal strength	19
1	i hate this unit with a passion and i sell the things its cheap 299 99 at most retail place right now and that 's what you are getting the one died in 24 hours while plugged in and never turned back on it also directed us to a road that was headed into the pacific ocean there is no road across in the pacific last time i checked it acquired satelites once and then never acquired them again and good luck talking to customer service both i talked to did n't speak english a dreadful unit maybe tomtom could go work at walmar	19
1	mouse movement is extremely slow it literally takes 10 \( ! \) seconds to get from one side of the screen to another \( 800x600 \) i just got it from officedepot buttons are too small and hard to control joystick is unresponsive	19
1	it works if there 's a direct line of sight to the reciever in other words if the ipod is lying down horizontally it wo n't respond you 'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work	19
1	should have believed all the other negative reviews did n't work in my honda civic and did n't work in my nissan altima both with original manufacturer tape decks in both cases the tape deck whirred for a bit then ejected the smartdeck	19
1	do not buy this if you own the c340 it does n't fit and amazon should n't market this as if it will it 's a nightmare to have to get it returned and get a refund this is also true for the cigarette lighter adapter i hope there will be clarity as to which accessories go with each model otherwise you 'll be in for a lot of wasted time and money the garmin is great but the fact that most of their accessories are not compatible within the product family is a huge problem	19
1	disaster supposed to work in conjunction with cordless phone extensions but will not work with other desk phones ! it only works with cordless phones i wanted a desktop phone on every desk with the cordless as a convenient extra feature but now every office is stuck using only the very clumsy cordless handset we were not informed of this until after we purchased and installed the phones no mention of the hold 'music' in the manual this product is a mess stay away get a real phone system	19
1	if there were a catagory for 0 stars that 's what i would have rated it i bought this model only because i wanted a tv that would fit into a small space on a kitchen counter the radio works the cd works but the tv died after l month and the tv was the only part i was interested in what kind of product is this \? i would like amazon to pick up this item and issue me a credit carol gruber	19
1	really wo n't use the tv but the cd only lasted 5 days and i use it everyday had to buy something else	19
1	basic connectivity and wireless work any attempt to use advanced firewall rules fail including vpn passthrough this device could not have gone through even a rudamentory test cycle please read the reviews this is common and these problem were confirmed by my it dept and also by d link 's tech 's as well on second one all of the exact same problems sad to have made a choice hope they make it right	19
1	had to give it one star because there is nothing lower this printer was the answer to my printing dreams for about three months with light home use only fault at that time is it is loud it will wake the dead which is ok since the dead do n't have to print things that often this is the perfect printer for them other than noise a faulty load paper error kept coming up then the paper load went bad it is very unreliable and ink cartridges run out very quickly and cost about 10 bucks a pop tonight i'm trashing it buying another printer tonight ! do not waste your money on this piece of trash	19
1	this printer does produce some fine output that is when it works the paper feed constantly refues to load paper the film scanner should have been left off all together \( not worth using \) i have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit \( read alot of negative reviews \) i have been a long time hp fan but after this experience i am going to look elsewhere my advice is to not even consider this printer	19
1	i just lost my synch adapter and it is on back order everywhere unfortunately this is necessary to connect to computer and to charge the player earliest date i can find one is 10 23 due to some shipping problem with creative labs i'm at a loss now that the battery is dead this is the dumbest idea ever why did n't they design the player so that the cords attached directly to the player \? i agree that you should order a back up as this thing is so easy to lose and so important	19
1	i ordered two of these for the first one neither the firewire nor the usb worked on my imac g5 \( macos 10 3 9 \) a copy would start and then hang after a while i returned it and the second one worked using usb but the firewire would hang like the first one a friend has one that works fine with his ibook g4 under 10 3	19
1	the user interface was horrible the product documentation was even worse i still ca n't figure out how to perform a regular scan no ocr this was poorly designed poorly supported get some other scanner this one is impossible	19
1	one month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine my car 's engine sounds better do n't waste your money i called sharp and they say is the fan great maybe i should remove it and use ice cubes	19
1	the problem is i have more than one guitar this one is my least favorite p s has bad soun	19
1	this is a piece of junk holy cow is it cruddy do n't even call it a guitar because its not its a bad thing to call it a guitar holy crud where 's the tylenol !	19
1	these work great initially i bought six of them of the six four broke one stopped altogether one stopped oscillating and the other 2 would only work on 1 speed i bought them in may and they broke after 2 3 and 4 months respectively they are expensive fans and i was extremely disappointed in their lack of durability they were used at night by adults and were not moved around at all i have had a floor fan for 15 years and it still works without a hitch these are cheaply put together and your money would be better spent on a fan with a better warranty \( this is 1 year \) and higher quality components	19
1	the paper stripes of 1 4 are too wide at times information such as names and phone numbers came out very clear if somebody is really after information he should n't have much trouble finding it after you throw away your paper	19
1	very poor design would never recommend this product the connection is so flaky you will end up wasting lot of time	19
1	i watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also if properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to tv is this unit record the show while watching the same show on tv \? \( some of the units can not record while you are watching the show tv has to be off ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	operates as described but lacks browser for use in pay for connection environments poor battery life need to have it fully charged every day even if you did not use it the previous day needs mute function volume could be louder too i would wait and buy next generation	19
1	the product description in january 2007 is inaccurate batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours not 60 there is no hands free speakerphone if you use a standard plug in headset the microphone does not work \( tested two units \) there is more the headset is very loud \( you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear \) but there is no volume adjustment the microphone has low sensitivity so you find yourself yelling into it the clock resets itself when the power is turned off i returned mine	19
1	this product has the potential to be tremendous but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches also there is a big 'rhigo skin' logo on the front which makes the case even that more distracting i'm sure that it is n't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail what a letdown p s if you are buying the 30gb version of this case it will double the thickness of your setup	19
1	this very expensive cable is already in the package if you purchased the forerunner 201 you wo n't need this unless you somehow lost it damn it is expensive ! this is a cable for goodness sake	19
1	i bought this printer based on its good reviews it does print beautiful photos but i have n't used it that hard for it to have failed so soon canon said they will send me a factory refurbished replacement for the body only the problem began with a squeak in the rollers and yesterday it would not feed the paper properly after several attempts to get it working per the instructions in the manual i contacted canon they ran me through a test with the machine after which they said the only thing they would do is send the replacement body	19
1	any pictures that i have printed with the color cartridge have come out too dard	19
1	i ca n't say the reason but this card blocks all the time after some days without use for unblock it i have to take it out many times and clean contacts then without knowing exactly what worked it begins to function	19
1	i bought one of these and it broke the first day i used it amazon replaced it for free but for no good because the second one broke soon after i got it too very poor laminator i went to office depot and bought one from xerox and it works much better	19
1	the phone was very annoying everytime i tried to call on the phone it would not connect i would have to either change the channel or just not call i was only able to connect to the number i was calling once in the 30 times i attempted to call i returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone consumers report was very wrong in their rating of this phone the phone was terrible !	19
1	i purchased this item to record lps into my computer thru the input on this device it sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop had same experience with loud right out of the box too startled me out of my skin ! mine did n't come with any disk although the box mentions software then again i bought this from an amazon 'partner' from amazon spend your money wisely and get an imic i'm going to	19
1	i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work	19
1	the product seems like a great idea however it did not come with attatchments for an i pod which is the reason we bought it called the company to get the adapter and now need the mfg part number it has just been a hassle	19
1	j r packs them so poorly that over half of them were shattered beyond repair upon arrival	19
1	there is something quite wrong with the laser mouse 6000 the shape is not right it 's kind of shallow i have to be conscious every time i grab this mouse so that i do n't to hit the side buttons all in all terrible	19
1	there are no instructins of anykind or anything with this item and it says it is also a 5 gig mp3 player well it comes with no software or anything else if all u want is speakers to plug in its your bag if u want more forget i	19
1	i would never buy this tv again or a samsung product for that matter i obviously purchased a lemon have had two different service calls to come out and try to fix it with no luck samsung initially told me i would get an exchange but then got hung up on and when i called back i was told my two service calls only count as one because they were in a 30 day period how 's that for sound logic i really like it when it works but unfortunately an important aspect of a tv is that you can expect to turn on when you press the power button	19
1	as the title it not worth the money at all even at such a low price the picture quality is bad very bad i 'd rather spend this money for other web cam	19
1	i bought a pv d4744 about a year ago it worked for a while now it wo n't read old disks and even with brand new disks the chance ofit being able to read the disk are not good about 90 of the brand new disks i have triedit wo n't read i will never buy another panasonic product again	19
1	i got this and installed it it ca n't read cds or dvds it ca n't write cds it can only write dvds	19
1	why would anyone get this type of charger \? for about 40 you can get an isupercharger that you can plug into the wall plug into a car lighter plug into a usb port or run off of a 9 volt battery with the 9 volt battery option you can use your ipod all you want even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping it 's a small all in one design i do n't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when i take my ipod along	19
1	i used it once and it charged my ipod only 80 after about four hours the next day i tried it again and it simply ceased functioning entirely this thing is garbage !	19
1	egad ! upon receiving this remote control i found that it requires four aaa batteries there was no mention of that requirement in the product description ! i concur with the other review writer the control is top heavy and i would add poorly designed it 's thick at the top and thin at the bottom making it unwieldy i will be returning this monstrosity	19
1	although these labels were functional i was disappointed as the paper is far thinner than for similar labels i had purchased previously and these tended to tear easily	19
1	i sent it back the price was right but the caller id did n't function when i got in touch with at t they told me maybe this phone is not compatible with the other phones in my home \( stupid response ! \) i then asked why would at t put a phone on the market that 's not compatible with my other phones i did n't get a reply ! ! ! they wanted to send me a replacement i told them there is no point in doing that if the replacement phone was not compatible with my other phones ! i guess amazon will be sending it back to at t	19
1	the cd payer is made of what feels like a cheap plastic the cassette adapter was broken after 10 seconds of use so i called coby they said i 'd have to pay them to send me a replacement ! my advice do n't bother buying coby	19
1	i bought this for my 12 year old who so far has n't been able to get it to play \( i have n't either \) before giving up on it we have to retrievethe directions from his grandmother 's house and read them thoroughly i'mdisapointed since coby 's have a good reputation	19
1	epson 's ink is great but very expensive ! i use a continuous flow system for my printer from mis just google mis \( midwest ink supply \)	19
1	the card was defective have applied for refund from amazon and have bought another to see if this one works hopefully wo n't have to keep doing this too many times have already wasted a lot of time on this pretty frustrating	19
1	i purchased one of these radios before christmas and it works great i decided i wanted another for work so i ordered another one i recived my radio a couple of days ago and had to send it back because the preset weather stations are off the mark and the only thing i can pick up is distorted and garbled they sent me a replacement and it too is off station at this point i'm wondering if the first one i got was the exception i do not reccomend this product unless you just want an am fm radio that part works great this will be my last first alert purchase unless i can try it out first !	19
1	do n't buy if you plan on printing often runs out very very fast	19
1	i do not do much printing but the ink ran low after a very short time it did not last as long as it normally does when i purchase it at an office supply store i wondered if it had dried out	19
1	i loved this printer ! ! the print quality is truly phenomenal ! i had a few issues with paper sizes too many pieces being fed through the rear feed slot same as other reviewers but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful and yes i am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer because it is dead at the ripe old age of 13 months ! exactly one month after the 1 yr warranty my printer is unfixable and hp wo n't do anything for me after speaking to 8 people on the phone \( only one of which i understood fully \) and 3 supervisors they just said that i'm sol so yes very nice printer if it lasts	19
1	i ordered the unit twice and twice i received a carrying case not the adapter i returned both and ordered direct from cobra when i had called customer support for amazon the second time i got connected to india of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong i guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says	19
1	i burn about 50 cds a week in live music trades i can tell you from experience that these discs do not last after a year or so they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems any scratches that they have only make it worse i recommend using sony fuji or tdk all the others are cheaply made in comparison and just do n't stand the test of time so if you care about preserving your cds do n't use these ones	19
1	this is not an xd to compactflash card adapter if you order this item number you will receive a pc card adapter that accepts xd picture cards and smartmedia cards and fits your pcmia 2 1 slot on a pc or mac it is not for a camera or substitute for a compactflash card there is nothing compact flash about it the product you will recieved does not look like the photo on amazon 's website	19
1	very very not user friendly no instruction to install worked after it got installed but doesnt work with the wireless internet in my house decided to resell it could be its only because i'm apple illeterate	19
1	does not work with non apple base stations ! i had a powermac g5 i was told by apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless g access points but no ! at my house my pc can see no less than 6 wireless ap 's \( some from neighbors one mine \) but this airport card can only see one \( which is an apple airport station \) ! tried everything \( googled set encryption modes slow downed my linksys wap tranfering bitrate to 2mbps etc \) and no luck returning it tomorrow	19
1	we had troubles fromt he start they correct a type would not work took to a brothers repair shop and they could not fix need some parts plus when you tried to type letters you would get numbers it was the present my daughter wanted the most for christmas and she could not use very sad so i will by another brand at a local store in town	19
1	this typewriter is an unbelievable piece of junk garbage do n't buy it even if they offer it to you for free there 's not enough room here to list the problems just skip it do yourself a favor and stay away from brother i 've had nothing but problems with their fax machines and printers as well do n't know how they stay in business	19
1	soon parted very disapointed bad design not for the gym which is what i bought them for sound is ok not wonderful wish i would have read these reviews before i spent the 100	19
1	i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are ! i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr i then saw the pricetag and unlike the other people i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr ! it is definitely not worth it for something i get for 8 extra a month attached to my cable service yes i do love the tivo interface and searching but i will not pay that much for it it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price knock 700 dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind	19
1	i was very disappointed when i got to south america and went to curl my hair and nothing happened take a look at the product specifications it has limited use for appliances between 500 and 1600 watts i had two different curling irons with me one was rated 85 watts and the other 125 watts i am not sure what appliances this converter was designed for take my recommendation buy the converter by tumi instead it is twice the price but it is one piece easy to travel and works with many different types of appliances i am very satisfied with it	19
1	this cartrige never printed any color than red even after cleaning many many times ! will never buy another cartrige from them paying twice the price for one that works is a better investment	19
1	the radio for the boom box worked the cd player did not work i had to return it to be repaired or replaced i do not have it back yet	19
1	manual and i cannot find that it supports sacd	19
1	the sony mdr if3000 headphones have average sound quality and are very uncomfortable to wear perhaps if one were an elf or a small child they would fit properly however if you 're like me a mere adult mortal they probably wo n't fit you they would be okay for simple stereo listening but not the kind of superlative sound experience suggested in the description if you 're looking for a solid pair of headphones for casually listening to music or watching your favorite movie the sony mdr if8000 are vastly superior headphones and well worth the extra money	19
1	this is a piece of junk the radio reception is terrible fm is marginal and am is almost nonexistent	19
1	the unit was 20ft from the receiver in the same room in direct view of eachother tivo would n't connect	19
1	i have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to windows vista as a result of the windows upgrade this product just lost half its value for me the drive works fine physically but the included backup software will not work with vista when i try to schedule an overnight backup the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling as others have noticed here western digital offers zero support for its software i cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem	19
1	when i went to use this product i did n't even have it for a day and the antenna broke	19
1	product came broken now your out of stock and i do not have that credit card anymore so now what i would like my money back address 2655 forest blvd jax fl 3224	19
1	the seam came apart and the gel leaked out in the first 6 months the non skid underside surface has a peculiar and distinctly unpleasant smell	19
1	i purchased this cable as a replacement and it is far worse than the original i had there is noticable quot shadow quot distortion my advice is to buy a higher quality cable w ferriete beads this cable was not useable	19
1	horrible the first time i slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front defeats the purpose for even buying it i would recommend getting an agent 18 case	19
1	this unit will not fit all lighter sockets i 've been unable to get the unit to work at all in my wife 's saab 9 3 the 33185 version does fit	19
1	everything is fine and dandy except the fact that it does n't come with the usb cord to hook the printer to the computer and that is a little important also i have windows vista and the printer is not compatible with it i have to download a patch but that was my own fault i guess you get what you pay for	19
1	first few weeks it worked and now we really needed it when driving in remotes areas 3 hrs away from home through a snowstorm it gave up working and we never were able to turn it on again we didnot take a map as we were sure with this navigation system we would be safe however we felt pretty unsafe and lostvery frustrating and we are very disappointed with this recently expensive magellan navigation system and with amazon as a usually depending sourc	19
1	not at all what i wanted it is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you do n't want them pushed ordered 2 and plan to return them i usually do n't even bother to write a bad review i just do n't write one but in this case i 'll make an exception yuk ! actually i rate it at a 0 but there was no 0 selection	19
1	this is a cheap cable in both cost and quality when connected between my voodoo3 3000 card and my mag innovision dx17f monitor the picture quality was poor with severe quot ghosting quot of the screen this cable does not have the cylinders on each end as most monitor cables do i assume the lack of these cylinders is what causes the degradation in signal quality	19
1	we 've been through 2 generations of this phone and they suck why we gave them a second chance i do n't know the buttons that get used the most stop functioning after about a couple of years then it 's off to the landfill i am fed up with this trend in products to stop working after a limited amount of time so long motorola	19
1	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested the etch tore when examing the inside of the printer i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage the next new cartridge would not work either wasted tech support said to have the printer repaired ya sure \( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out \) printer repair would cost me more a new one	19
1	beware this unit does not work with toshiba laptops tech support is non existent you will never get through on the phone email support is non existent you will have to wait weeks to hear back if it does work with your laptop this unit does a great job of recording and playing	19
1	these speakers are big in size but short on performance except for the price tag not much else excites one about them they make a good surround sound system with the sony 3 speaker set for surround sound but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub these speakers lack bass inspite of their size and sound quality is poor at higher volumes	19
1	i found this paper on amazon as an accessory to the olympus camedia p 400 printer this paper does not fit the p 400 because this paper is too wide thus with the p 400 this paper is useless	19
1	item is advertised as working with all rino series but it does not work with the rino 53	19
1	please be aware of an important issue with this cable even though it is recommended for the etrex gps series it will not fit their flat 4 pin connector i had to return mine and bought one at the local rei	19
1	i spent two days tried to have it formatted by my powerbook g4 and set up a wireless network to replace my microsoft wireless router no luck it is on the shelf ever since people at the genius bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel to set up other routers with a pc you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars not apple if you do n't have time do n't buy this product	19
1	i got this for christmas 2004 played 5 dvd 's on it and started to get the quot no disk quot reading i only had it for 1 month i sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model we will see if it has the same problems according to reviews of the 1700m model i expect the same i suggest you spend a little more money and get a better dvd player	19
1	the item is good the sound is decent but i tought than a refurbished item was an item that you can hardly say it 's used the speakers i got did not look good at all scrached and dirty you can see it was used for a very long time no too happy about this item	19
1	when it works it does extend the range however every time you turn off a wirelessly connected pc and turn it on again the pc is not assigned an ip number unplug this extender and the pc is assigned an ip number by the router without any problem a brief power blackout will cut ip numbers to your wirelessly connected pcs i purchased this particular d link range extender because i wanted to ensure that it works well with my di 624 router i wasted my money buying this device it 's useless and it 's too light to even serve as a door stop	19
1	this device is much bulkier than it needs to be but an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod the ipod plugs in to the back and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod it is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too	19
1	other than the power switch is not easy to see the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you even using it for church meeting recording you would not get excited for its sound quality if you can tolerate the size of sony ecm ms907 you may like the sound quality of that microphone if you like a small lapel microphone with true voice try the akg wms 40 wireless system our people are much happier with the akg wireless microphone than this one	19
1	why not sell the thing with a battery it 's a special battery not available in the boonies so i have a choice drive 30 miles or wait another week for a battery to come in the mail iknow iknow in the text it does say battery not included but who reads that \? so for the folks who read this buy a battery too ! ! !	19
1	it was n't clear from the packaging that this does n't work with the newer ipods with video i had to search the internet \( after i already purchased and could see that it clearly did n't fit \) to find this information	19
1	the thing would n't even fit around my handle bar i had to zip tie it on a waste of	19
1	i 've owned the new v 3 product for over a week and have still not been able to unlock it for use customer service is worse than i 've ever experienced they wo n't commit to calling me back and have suggested that someone will be working on the problem and i should continue to keep trying the unlock process until it works	19
1	i truely wish i had found the prior reviews for this product before i bought it unfortunately i am now stuck with a product that will not start and will not run on my pc running winxp2 ! ! do not buy this product ! ! support sucks all around and there appears to be no fix now or in the near future to get software working i lost 100 bucks on this one ! !	19
1	i 've had this scanner for 6 months now it worked ok the first month but since then it loves to eat paper it scans multiple pages at once for example a 20 page document becomes 15 pages one scanned i have to scan the same document multiple times \( sometimes up to 12 times \) until the scanner finaly scans each page it gets to be very frustrating actually it 's the worse piece of office equipment i ever purchased otherwise it works fine	19
1	this linksys stuff simply does n't work and do n't try getting technical support it 's a complete waste of time if you ca n't google the solution just take the stuff back the adapter install took out my tcpip stack even for my wired connection it took me 3 full days to figure out that i needed to remove any sign of linksys odyssey and funk software from the registry then remove and reinstall the tcpip stack linksys support could n't even get me a promised registry cleaner after 28 days a dozen emails and 5 separate phone calls linksys support is just embarrassing do n't be caught having to depend on it	19
1	my title is my review the thing worked for a week after that it would n't power up anymore chinese junk	19
1	i purchased this cable and the pins were weak and clumsy i could not even plug it in and one of the pins broke i threw it away it is a piece of junk	19
1	i was \( wrongly \) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from voodoo be sure your computer is supported because targus tech wo n't give you any info about voltage amperage or wattage on this thing so you ca n't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer so amazon as usual graciously took it back love amazon i just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky i did n't keep it and try to make it work	19
1	i had the tx sr304 everything sounded great however certain times when i played my dvd the onyko produced a loud high pitched ear piercing sound sounds almost like a record scratching the most common times it made this sound was during the dvd menu when it replays the music theme the receiver would transition from dolby digital to stereo then back to dd again then making that loud sound everything was great but this one problem made me return this item which is a bummer because i would have kept it otherwise	19
1	i bought this hub less than 2 months ago it has stopped working ! if i plug it in it is no longer powered do not buy this p o s !	19
1	this phone stopped working just right after i threw all the packing material away horrible horrible static non user friendly buttons as well i wish i could have returned it do not buy this phone	19
1	the sound quality is fine if you are in range the dual headsets work as advertised in other words 1 you cannot talk on both phones at the same time \( instead you can transfer a call to the other phone \) 2 the range is not great \( though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about 30 ft \) 3 the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none other than that it 's a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household	19
1	make sure you know that these will work with your camcorder before buying apparently they work fine with sony camcorders \( the packet too says so \) but not with canon also it 's incompatible with my new panasonic camcorder too interestingly it was displayed as a combo offer when i bought my panasonic camcorder which is the reason why i bought it anyway but got duped	19
1	these discs do not work with my canon camcorder i think the label should inform people they may not be compatible with certain devices	19
1	tapes are cheaply priced and the picture quality offered by them is even cheaper i say if your doing everyday recording and dont care about the quality these tapes are for you but if you wanna save your favorite movie or show jvc or fuji is the way to go they both offer incredible picture and sound quality	19
1	switch did not work with my samsung 191t monitor customer service people were slow to respond and were not helpful	19
1	the apple remote is included with the imac g5 and works great with it and front row however for the ipod it 's almost useless the lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling in short do n't buy this remote look at other non apple remotes that are more full featured	19
1	this antenna is too directional dependent almost always i have to re adjust its orientation to obtain better reception on any one channel in addition if you live in an apartment very close to or surrounded by adjacent apartment blocks forget about this antenna given most of the previous reviews it will probably work okay if you live in small buildings	19
1	i 've had my micro for over a year now and when it worked i loved it ! however i'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue the sound is output in layers and i am constantly trying to reposition my headphones to get full sound my husband called creative labs for assistance and he was told that it would cost him per month for a customer service subscription after reading these reviews it seems we 'd be paying creative labs so that they could tell us there 's nothing they can \( or will \) do next brand please	19
1	7 out of the 25 disks would not write i didnt much care for the product considering this factor	19
1	i cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about 20 of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo 270 this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda	19

1	purchased cobra 75 wx st all in handset mobile cb about 1 year ago easy installation up front controls very convenient six months after installation speaker in mike failed could only get sound through external speaker using external jack repair shop said it would cost almost as much to fix as the unit cost	19
1	i use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the gps 360 device further down the dashboard this adapter apparently ca n't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle i 've only used it twice first time it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half the connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable but i'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again i do n't want the connector to snap off next	19
1	this cable looks nice when you do n't linger on a digital channel what happens to me is that if i leave the tv on a digital channel overnight the next day it will be a split screen mode showing double image of the broadcast to fix it i have to change it to a non digital channel and switch it back i guess it is possible that it is the cable box but nothing happens like that on the component outputs	19
1	returned it would n't work with vista and a canon mp780 and it certainly wo n't work with mac os x clients \( note the product does n't advertise support for mac \) why is it so difficult for manufacturers to create a wireless print server that works with multifunction printers	19
1	true to its name it has high sensitivity too much that on a very smooth surface this mouse becomes live start moving in all directions on my couch the mouse is dead if the surface is smooth the mouse laser is too sensitive but when the surface is soft or rough the mouse gets stuck the paws foot of the mouse is sticky not sure if this is a defective but really hate this mouse i am returning this product even at the slowest speed it is difficult to click a checkbox on the screen	19
1	the mouse is larger than needed and lighter than the average mouse i have dual screens and need an extra accurate mouse this is not it unfortunately with this one the sensor does n't stand still my screensaver hardly ever turns on because when the mouse is just sitting there the arrow jumps in all directions about 2 3 arrow spaces around do n't be fulled by the laser technology in this particular mouse my old optical was better	19
1	i 've had a very difficult time finding an alarm clock with the bright indiglo light so i was happy to find this one however with my first eagle the alarm did n't go off amazon was great about the exchange for a new one \( kudos \) my repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight wo n't light up and i have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on i second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle the loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning but i put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough	19
1	this phone would not charge for us we had to send it back for a refund	19
1	i have this setup with my new laptop that runs vista premium the device installs ok and it works with media center it 's great for watching tv but if you have scheduled recordings and you like to have your machine be in standby mode until it 's time to record you may be disappointed when coming out of standby sometimes the tuner is recognized and at other times it is not when it 's not recognized i have to unplug and then replug the device in order for it to be recognized because of this i have missed several recordings i contacted pinnacle support and their recommendation was not to use standby	19
1	why pay 46 75 for this battery when you can get the same thing made by another manufacturer \( impact \) for only 19 95 at b h photo and video i have both the the dl 150 pentax battery that came with the camera and the impact imdl150 i ca n't tell any difference between them other than the price camera makers make a hugh profit on propritory items that can be obtained elsewhere at much lower prices	19
1	the new ipods do not have the connections to work with firewire so this cable will only charge the new ipods with video besides this this is a good product for the ipods	19
1	i purchased this from amazon based on the description that a long lasting rechargeable battery was included however when it arrived there was no battery upon questioning amazon about the battery the customer service rep said he could give me a 5 credit for the batteries i asked how the battery could only be worth 5 he said that is what aa rechargeable batteries go for the bag is ok but do n't order this if you are expecting a battery specifally made for compact printers	19
1	after few months it just stopped working also it is not rechargable and need to replace batery every 1 2 week	19
1	computer brain sent the wrong product right before xmas so the present that i intended had to be shipped back and it is jan 16 and i am still awaiting the right one so i do n't even know what the product is actually like yet	19
1	purchased thinking it was gold plated as advertised but actually is not quite noisy settled for a monster stereo \( male to male \) cable instead	19
1	i bought this cable to connect 50 plasma tv to computer when we connected the cable with tv we could not get it to display computer screen we spent 2 hours with plasma manufacturer on telephone troubleshooting the connection at the end at our dissapointment we found out that the cable was defective when we tried different cable everything worked	19
1	functionally the ifm is great i like to use it for workouts at the gym to watch fm transmitted tv 's however the construction is extremely cheap i bought two of them and both fell apart one fell apart the second time i used it the construction is so cheap that i could n't put it back together because the controls do n't line up i wish there was an alternative but i ca n't find one i like being able to switch between ipod tunes and fm but will have to carry two devices from now on	19
1	i just received the printer in trying to set it up i realized there is no computer to printer cable included nor any explanation of what kind you need you have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema	19
1	price reflects quality poor sound quality no features not that easy to use do n't waste your mone	19
1	received my camera today \( 05 22 \) and all items are not in the box i am missing hand strap ni mh batteries battery charger and cradle adapter worse part is i did receive a usb cable but it is not the right size and doesn't fit this is very frustrating how do i get the missing items	19
1	camera died after firmware upgrade using the ethernet port to perform upgrade as dlink recommends i bought from ebay new and dlink refused to replace or repair so beware if you pay several hundred dollars make sure you buy it from a authorized dealer or dlink want work on it or even attempt to help you get it repaired think twice about buying dlink because down the road you may have to throw it away regardless of the price you paid need to research other brands and see what their repair policy is after warranty from unauthorized seller or buying used	19
1	there is absolutley nothing wrong with the car charger it works fine however the fm transmitter has 2 problems for me 1 the connector is not long enough to connect through many of the protective cases made for zune so you have to take it out of the case 2 the signal is very weak and did not work for me in either of my cars i ended up buyin a cassette adapter which worked much better and there was a 100 better sound quality	19
1	reception is not that great with the stock rubber duck antenna and also the press to talk button and the channel changing buttons are way to close together making it awkward to use would not buy again	19
1	this mic is a piece of trash i bougth it and you have to shout to be listened es una completa basura y una perdida de recursos	19
1	i'm sure it would work well somewhere just not for our small business i put it behind an adsl router and used it to authenticate pppoe it was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected after hours on the phone with tech support from linksys and the dsl router people nobody could help while it connected it did work very well it just did stay up too bad	19
1	very disappointed in this phone i have an early generation uniden phone \( without answering machine \) that was a total joy this turkey has weak audio and ear piercing intermittent static if you bother to look at earlier reviews you will see that this is a common problem with this phone avoid at all costs	19
1	my cyberhome portable dvd player worked for all of 1 day it is unable to play dvds or cds of any type also if you charge the battery according to manufacturer specs it will completely drain out within 24 hours i attempted to get service from cyberhome to no avail even though product is still under warranty their support number is unreachable as is their support email address attempts to locate the company via the web were unsuccessful this would have been a great product at a great price if only it had worked purchase at you own risk check out the manufacturer web site you have been warned	19
1	product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web in addition no all region code supportted ! i will return it asap	19
1	i bought this antenna hoping that it would improve signal strength as they advertised 6db on the box the performance was worse than the original 2db antenna that came with my wireless adapter back it goes	19
1	i have just now tested my signal strength at various locations with the d link di 624 router 's original antenna and with this one the hai6sip made no difference whatsoever at any location regardless of its orientation it 's going back to the store tomorrow	19
1	i purchased this battery as a replacement for the original battery in my cordless telephone although i fully charged the battery upon arrival it will not hold a charge for more than 24 hours i would not purchase this battery again	19
1	i do n't want to rate this product since i have n't used it i had to though i just wanted to share with everybody that this product still does not come with a charger i received them left them unopened upon not seeing a charger called customer service \( they did n't do anything about the posting \) and sent them back a waste of time and effort and extra hassle and waiting to get the money back do not get mislead by pictures or descriptions	19
1	the battery packs in these walkie talkies last for about an hour only i am very disappointed in the quality we need them for emergencies throughout the day this is a farmed animal sanctuary non profit and we cannot afford to purchase new batteries after paying for these already i am willing to change my review if we get new batteries they came on time they are good quality other than the batterie	19
1	this product did n't work with my wireless mouse scanner and it would mess up my print que and i would have to restart the keyspan software to get it working again i returned it	19
1	it was very bright at first then button began malfunctioning i emailed customer service and never heard back do n't know if it was a problem with my unit or a poor quality button	19
1	this cheap piece of plastic broke within 2 months of me owning it ! ! buyer beware !	19
1	i have returned this item to amazon i paid 43 99 when they had it in stock the audio out on this dock is a stereo mini \( 1 8 \) jack the connection is terrible from then getgo with low volume distortion and noise when the jack is jiggled i would highly recommend the dock they 're currently selling at radio shack for 29 99 it has rca outputs on the back and excellent sound quality it charges and the remote has a menu button	19
1	i bought a 700 series iriver to use at the gym which came with this armband at first it was great but it did n't last there are two clasps which do n't sta attcked well and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use	19
1	4 months into it and it stops playing jams up and i ca n't remove the cassette or any or the cd 's wo n't ever but pioneer again	19
1	this was ok for the money decent sound quality however it died on me after just 2 months of use the usb drive still works \( sometimes \) but the built in player no longer works i found the controls less than user friendly and difficult to use	19
1	these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought i did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality they also feel like they are made of cheap plastic definently not worth the 15 i paided for them	19
1	i bought this to replace an 80gb portable firewire drive wanted more capacity and the same convenient portability there 's nothing convenient about its need for 2 usb slots and the data moves slower than the firewire drive it is replacing nice little glitch on the small type of the packaging if you 're reading the requirements for mac os x you miss the bullet point in the win xp section calling out the need for 2 free ports amazon 's description of the product is similarily misleading as completely negelcts the mention of needing two usb ports boooo seagate i'm offended that you 're offering such clumsy connectivity	19
1	i spent 60 on this and it broke after 6 months i guess the old saying you get what you paid for is true \(	19
1	do not by this product it has several issues go to the forums on the linksys website and see for yourself most people myself included have problems with the cable modem crashing and requiring a reset on a regular basis this device also has firewall issues that cause problems with the wii and xbox360 it 's spi firewall component is at fault and can not be disabled without turning off the entire firewall even in the face of the number of users having problems linksys has never released a firmware update and it does n't appear that they will	19
1	when we brought this home and took it out of the box we were rather impressed with the sleek design and the cisco label when we got it all hooked up all our dreams of surfing the internet at the speed of light turned into nightmares with constant connection drops and no tech support ! if you read the boards on the linksys site you 'll see that there are no end of connection failures across many different isp 's and areas of the us since this item has been released please do n't waste your money on this worthless hunk of garbage you 'll end up sucking down 2 bottles of ibuprofen and a 12 pack of your choice before the night is even through	19
1	after less than one week of use i am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection in 5 days i have had to cycle power on this unit on average more than once per day after it locks up the web ui fails to respond to connection requests it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power i have tried to work with netgear technical support but their suggestions \( e g lower mtu \) have been useless and their responses quite tardy if you are looking for a firewall vpn unit i suggest you pass on this particular product	19
1	after just one week of use and installing the newest firmware this router began showing sickly signs requiring a daily reboot by week two it began needing to be rebooted every 15 minutes this now seems typical of previous experiences i have had with other netgear products so much for plug and play my recommmendation leave netgear to the passive routers and use another brand for firewalls and dhcp serving	19
1	this is the only card that has ever failed to work on my palm tungsten c so i know it 's not a hardware problem with my pda the handheld device recognizes the card and filez shows that the programs and databases are present and available but the program does n't run the only response i get is loading from card please wait but nothing happens my repeated queries to tech support via its web site have gone unanswered do n't count on any help from the company if you also get a lemon	19
1	despite what the belkin folk told me over the phone this does not work on a mac	19
1	after constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the belkin bozo 's \( support \) i received a long delayed canned e mail answer to my problem which did n't help a bit i finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a linksys network card both linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement no more dropouts i would suggest that prospective purchasers of belkin products hesitate before buying it 's one thing to have a product that works intermittantly but it 's really frustrating when product support is worthless	19
1	i love this minisisc it holds an incredible amount of songs the equivolent of an i pod mini and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great but don't buy it here ! just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by 9 00 while everything else in my order would have been shipped free and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here i got a hi md recorder instead of an i pod and i'm glad i did just do n't buy the disks from amazon	19
1	do n't waste your money on these things ! you can get a far better pair of headphones for comparable or less money spent these things are nothing more than a marketing scheme to sell a look and fashion accessory these headphones sound terrible and are very uncomfortable total p o s ! !	19
1	skull candy ear phones do look nice but it stops at that within 2 seconds of putting them on they hurt the things are horribly uncomfortable and do not look or feel very solid the sound was ok but not great and not very loud even with the in line volume turned all the way up yes they do look good but head phones should sound great and be comfortable looking good should be a bonus not the entire sales point i am very disappointed in skull candy if you want good ear phones for a reasonable price go for sony or senheisser if you want a fashion accesorie go with skull cand	19
1	installed quickly great image quality but within three days the card started to overheat and cause the computer to reboot i was told by others and ati forums that the 1650 pro with ati stock heat sink is known for its problems do not buy 1650 pro unless sapphire or other upgraded coolant system on the card also note this may be an unrelated issue after so many crashes the motherboard was fried and needed to be replaced cannot tell if related to video card or not yet if you are wanting an ati stock card there have been no known issues regarding stock cooling with the agp 1800 1900 series cards	19
1	this product is not worth the money or trouble i also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up it was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up save your money and do n't buy this this would actually qualify for a zero star rating	19
1	simply put the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely there are always bubbles if you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you the keyboard soft material cover is not so bad but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard so when you close the lid the material then transfers some of that dirt right back my resolve just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft clean semi wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster	19
1	i purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle they are were very uncomfortable from the start but i could listen to music that did n't last long the connection would not hold and if i did n't hold it together the music faded out also music faded in and out from ear to ear i finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less	19
1	when you buy a name like sony you expect to get decent stuff this dvd recorder failed miserably no s video inputs in the rear so you have to run s video to the front panel \( which my 2 year old loved to unplug \) nice editing features if you have the time unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done \( who knows if i will get it back \) i replaced it with a lite on dvd recorder \( at less than half the price \) and am very happy with it	19
1	i'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if i had used it i have found samsung products to be very good i did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my xm satellite radio subscription i already am paying costs for two radios i purchased this item to have more portable capabilities but i did not want to incur an additional charge on my xm account consequently i returned the product without using it	19
1	memorex changed the cases in this package yet failed to reflect this on the packaging i purchased them at a local office depot it 's the one with the patented hub that 's supposed to protect your dvds center anyway the two packages i got are no difference in comparison to regular cases i 've gotten with sets i 've bought i felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund	19
1	for the price this is not a bad keyboard here are the two major problems i have with it 1 \) the feel is nothing like a real piano the keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note 2 \) the instructions have a big sticker on them stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and or birth defects \( including lead \) and to wash your hands after handling how on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot very possibly by children \? it 's going back	19
1	claiming that this fan 's 3 speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling is very misleading on low the fan barely moves any air on high it still does n't move much air and is incredibly quiet nearing silent in my opinion if you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads this is not the fan for you the 3 speed switch is useless as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high	19
1	the buttons on the remote although many are not useful the only button we use \( to advance or back up slides in a presentation \) was difficult to use poorly located unreliable not a good selectio	19
1	i purchased this product to share my dvi monitor and logitech bluetooth keyboard mouse between my two main machines the exact use promoted by the manufacturer i successfully patched the firmware to eliminate the incessant beeping but am extremely disappointed with the dvi video at 1600 by 1200 \( severe streaking and noise \) and the audio is totally unuseable given the severe hum and noise btw i am using belkin kvm cables do n't even think about purchasing this unit	19
1	not worth one star ! lasted about 1 week and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town it is now officially dead and useless even the short while it worked it was almost useless switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible do not buy this do n't even think about it	19
1	i'm sure this product is fine but do n't order it through amazon through ritz camera they just cancelled my order without warning having listed that the bag was available freaking idiots	19
1	i bought these headphones as a replacement for my second pair of blown ipod earbuds hoping to get stronger bass and better sound isolation i got both unfortunately the sound coming out of these headphones is extremely muddy and overly bass heavy furthermore they were quite painful in my ears the first several times i wore them and the mini jack has a poor connection often leaving me without sound in one ear do yourself a favor and spend the money to get a quality pair of headphones particularly if you 're looking to buy in ear headphones	19
1	i bought the terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some am and fm radio stations i was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system perhpas because of my apartment building or the quality of the stereo the antenna did n't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory provided antenna i did notice improvement in the static \( or lack of it \) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well \( they went from great to excellent \) but the stations that were tuning in quot poorly quot got no better with the terk antenna overall it was probably not worth the money paid	19
1	the software is terrible slow and glitchy i have to start and close it multiple times to get it to find the player the operators manual is just under 100 pages so have fun learning the intricacies of the controls granted the hardware is cute and the variety of functions is impressive assuming you have sufficient spare time to study the manual	19
1	we used the cd player one time the next time we attempted to use it it would not play the cd we ended up having to return it because it was defective	19
1	i am a person who actually uses these items alot after 2 weeks of using these headphones the right earpiece quit playing and i hear ms is not suppporting anything that stops operating also it is too expensive i am enjoying the zune but all the accessories should be a little more accessible	19
1	the case was advertised in a size large enough to accomodate my camera but when i received it the size was very small now i am stuck with something i cannot use your return policy was that it had to be in original packaging and unopened how is one to know unless they open it	19
1	worked great for about a week then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a da	19
1	i purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it the drive has a controller board error i contacted western digital for a replacement but they tell me that it is out of warranty apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it if it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from western digital with other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties i will never buy western digital again	19
1	if you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the att5995 or handset590 3 turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more not even close i do not have a hearing problem but this phone had me thinking i did the speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality	19
1	i loved this phone but after only a few weeks the button is stuck and the phone ca n't pick up i want it fixed but do n't know how	19
1	unreliable pile of 'you know what' worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up fresh batteries no go called customer service outsourced call center to india rep followed generic script telling me to 1 \) use lithium ion batteries and 2 \) press power nav simultaneously as suspected bogus advice fresh batteries metered out to 1 62 volts each 4 84 volts total yes i tried lithium ion batteries anyway still no go am still waiting for magellan thales to respond am still owner of unreliable gps still have about 400 invested in unit plus software and maps still kicking myself for buying a magellan product do n't do it really do n't do it	19
1	this is a great idea a small cd player to match the rest of the tivoli line unfortunately the quality of the units i tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the tivoli line all in all tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems one would n't play the disc one would n't eject the disc one had an led readout that would go blank and one had variations on all of these problems the model one is a great product and the pal and the others are close behind but the model cd needs a lot more work	19
1	setting this unit up has been impossible and i have not been able to use it i have sought help of dlync website dlynk phone support the have not been able to work me through it i have paid for a machine i cannot use have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up another person who has the same system with which i wanted to communicate has had the same problem and cannot use hers	19
1	if you are not an it person you will need help setting up using d link customer service is a chore due to language issues i bought the video phone to contact my son in taiwan and it never would connect d link help line \? \? could not understand why and were of no help what so ever i could reach the test location but that was it complete waste of money ! !	19
1	a nice idea that does n't provide adequate audio quality in my experience the unit would pick up noise from the operation of my cd player resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks in addition on trips i had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations	19
1	i ordered this product and put it in my nikon d200 the product was improperly manufactured and caused the pins in my camera to bend rendering it inoperable i had no idea what the cause was and went to my camera store and ended up damaging one of their cameras as well we took a quick look at the card and the holes were obviously improperly aligned the damage to the cameras was repairable and the replacement card i received worked ok but this is really not an acceptable situation for such an expensive piece of equipment	19
1	the one i ordered works but the plastic nub in the rear of the unit i received has a slightly flawed location the nub is intended to insert into the ground hole of your recepticle \( outlet \) my nub is slightly too high preventing it to be plugged into a top outlet because of this nub it 'll only work in the bottom outlet i see little reason for this plastic protruding nub to exist in the first place	19
1	pny memory is not very specific on its products check and re check that the specs are what you need pny is more a reseller of dubious memory brands of asiatic origin \( not that others are'nt but \) pay the extra and go for respected brands like viking and kingston you ca n't go wrong in the long term it 's a better investment	19
1	nothing that uses fw400 responds to being plugged into this device whether is it bus powered or not bloody useles	19
1	did not work with my palm t c right away i 've not used this for any other purpose i expect either palm or sd to release proper software to have it work with palm t c	19
1	do not order this item and expect to get what you see i ordered the super high speed card \( rpsdh01gu1a \) and what i got was a low quality high speed card \( rpsdk01gu1a \) seems to be some kind of a scam that ritz is running with amazon 's blessing buyer beware this has happened to me before when you order from one of amazon 's partners and amazon will do nothing to help you	19
1	i paid 35 for a barely adequate product case it does not securely mount or protect the creative zen it is overpriced and underperforms as others have mentioned you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player the set up feature is a joke you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product the design engineer should be fired do not buy this is jun	19
1	the product did n't do what it said it would i cut the power to use it in my car \( i should n't have assumed it worked properly \) so i could n't return it and ended wasting 50 i was extremly dissapointed in this product	19
1	it is very hard to update the remote very seldom we can delete and if there are two dvr boxes remote get confused and keep on turning off and on even though we choose the right one such as a or b software update is cumbersome and take 45 minutes on a intel quad computer with 2 g memory can supply some patches i have the remote sitting on my coffee table useless	19
1	wow how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far well i m still waiting	19
1	i love the saitek 880 wired gamepad so i figured the wireless would be that much better unfortunately my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems there 's nothing worse than the few times i really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out i bought this and the batteries died i sent saitek an e mail and they sent me two new ones great they worked ! then they died soon after hopefully their new wireless which runs on one aa battery will not have any issues however this one 's a dud	19
1	after 3 days of having this controller it already started to have problems the docking station would not pick up charges from the battery anymore making my controller useless for the amount of money i spent i am very disappointed	19
1	i do n't like these radios becase they only go about 1 2 the mile the battery does n't hold full charge i would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range	19
1	i doubt that they are all this bad maybe i just got quot lucky quot the first time i put the tape in the motor could hardly pull the tape when i tried to record it played back all shaky like a playing a record off center on a turntable i returned it	19
1	the keyboard protector fits very well on my macbook but in the end i got tired of how much slower my typing was when i used the protector it claims it does n't slow down your typing speed at all but it really does you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so as i'm typing this review now i'm not using my protector anymore if you do n't mind how it slows down your typing then go ahead and get it	19
1	will not hold bose souround spkrs will not mount for key hole speakers also i paid 11 99 for these on amazon the saw them in wal mart for 7 78 good for a cheap system but if your speakers weigh more than 5 lbs step u	19
1	i returned my banshee stereo it sure was loud however the music seemed to wave in and out you cannot charge your ipod either there is no remote there is no battery compartment not portable at all there are many other choices for less price save your money and look for something else	19
1	i thought i was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually but when i later bought a one off replacement not custom tank i noticed the ink level bar on the printer lcd was not only full but also longer than the other bars ! if the custom tanks hold only about half the ink this is n't the bargin it appears	19
1	there is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper the cartridges are not full ! i just got off the phone with hp tech support and they confirmed this the cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as custom cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4x6 photos in fact the tech support rep discribed the custom cartridges as having way less than standard cartridges less than 50 full on a related note i asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my new printer were full and he said they should have been full standard cartridges so this value pack is n't such a great value now is it \?	19
1	i tested this along with the neuros mpeg4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the neuros the picture with the sandisk is very pixelated especially with fast action sports like football and basketball the sandisk does have a better interface and is easier to understand and set up quickly but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor fyi i'm using a psp as my viewer	19
1	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just 5 months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player	19
1	when i received my cobra nav system the cord to use it was missing and i have had to call three times and still nhave not received the cord i contacted cobra but i think it came from target co	19
1	i ordered this antenna to enhance the reception of the uhf channels i live in a big city and i thought i should n't have a problem with any indoor antenna it seems i was mistaken this antenna is useless it is almost no better than my previous 99 cents store antenna	19
1	completely useless only shows a digital display when ipod is fully charged how long does your ipod stay fully charged \? even when showing digital display does n't actually broadcast maxell replaced it with the p 4a for a reason amazon should n't even be selling this it makes me distrust amazon i got it as a christmas present but it was bought in october so they wo n't even take it back follow up after i emailed amazon they issued a complete refund which they refused to do over the phone now they just need to pull the product since they \( probably wisely \) are n't carrying the p 4a and therefore ca n't recommend it as an option	19
1	i guess this is a bad review owing to bad item description not bat quality turns out it is not a universal ipaq stylus set so make sure your ipaq is combatible ! !	19
1	this router has been in operation for about 3 weeks when it is functioning correctly it is a pleasure to use unfortunately it requires almost daily power cycling to keep it running all the idiot lights show normal operation but there 's no wired or wireless connectivity until it 's power cycled	19
1	this device worked great for a short span of time \( a few weeks \) then just stopped working i returned it to amazon and received a new replacement it worked fine for a while then stopped working it 's a great idea but very weak quality	19
1	i received this item and it proved to be defective i have returned the original item and amazon has been promising me that they would ship the replacement for over a month now but has failed to make any of their estimated ship dates right now i am looking for another source and about to cancel the order	19
1	the ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter i received only a receiver this is false advertising and is patently illegal they ought to be ashamed of themrselves	19
1	i bought this item with good price good deal for the space 300gb moved all personal videos and data with confidence after 6 months no power coming up unable to switch on went to data recovery center and told 700 to 3000 depend on the issue seagate want to replace the drive but helpless on the data be careful when you buy these seagate 3 5 inch pushbutton backup external hard drives venkat vinnakota	19
1	it may work fine for those who use ps2 but using usb it frequently locks up i have my laptop and desktop plugged in but if i unplug the laptop i have to shut everything down unplugg the kvm and start over what a total pai	19
1	i tried it on 4 laptops and none of them was able to sustain the signal it kept on dropping out ! mind you two of the internal cards did a much better job than it	19
1	the bag is very nice looking nice material everybody loves it lots of compartments inside fit all accessories i need plus some documents but the top part \( the zipper \) is a big problem it just has to get 200 in a way while the notebook pocket does n't provide any flexibility i just have to scratch my brand new notebook in and out very frustrating \( same as another review here \) my opinion find another one i'm gonna do it myself	19
1	i have an hp pavillion ze5000 series laptop my laptop hardly fits in this bag the battery holder is also too small practically unusable very disappointed with the product	19
1	it came within one week of being ordered it is an excellent product and is as advertised i received a manual for sony 's compact disc recorder instead of the manual for the vrdvc30	19
1	i ordered this cable a few weeks ago although i must say that it does work fine the cable looks cheap \( in fact it is very thin \) and its length is less than 6 feet as you may agree length does matter so you do not want to fall short when it comes to that so for 20 \( including shipping \) i think it was not exactly a good deal	19
1	i bought an airplay2 from am apple store for around 60 other than the fact that blank fm stations are hard to find in the new york metropolitan area and that you need to keep changing to different blank stations as you drive the product itself is simply terrible even if you are in a parking lot and find a blank fm station the quality of the music the airplay broadcasts is very bad the bass is almost non existent and there is a constant hiss in the background that you cannot get rid of this product is not worth buying especially for 60	19
1	if you do n't use the printer on a daily basis these cartridges dry up only days after you stop given that the bjc 80 is a portable printer i only use it while traveling which means having to buy new cartridges for every trip a real money drain	19
1	i 've bought one of the 12c platinum because i needed a calculator in my office i do n't do financial calculations so probably i 'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics but i like rpn and the programmable features build quality is below expected intro key responsiveness is different than other keys' the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted so the calculator is slightly unstable with the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece disappointed	19
1	antec has dropped the ball on this one my power supply came in doa if you read reviews there are lots of reports of short life on power supply the case weighs 25 pounds it is a major hastle to uninstall everything and mail it back to california it is a pretty case with some well thought out features but not worth reliability hastles	19
1	this cartridge does not fit my hp 648c as advertised the color cartridge that accompanied it did however	19
1	i did not like the fact that this microphone needs a hard to find battery which is not included in the box it was sold	19
1	i ordered this cable and ended up sending it back to amazon and i advised them why the thx 800 cable is not blue the thx 600 cable is blue i called monster cable and got hold of their technical support they said they have never made a thx 800 cable in blue amazon obviously has not followed up on this issue	19
1	the product shipped is not the same as the picture apparently this is a common thing for this item	19
1	terrible user interface you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features pulls multiple papers through so you must start again is a g3 which you would think would be compatible with earlier non g3 fax machines wrong so you ca n't fax to 75 of the community that has a non g3 unit ! i thought i was buying quality from canon when i paid 250 for this hunk of junk ! the cheap brother and hp 's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use and much less expensive save your money and save the headaches ! sorry canon this product was a disaster	19
1	i think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax ! i especially got this machine because i thought it was a quality machine and would n't do that but i was wrong sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating i would stay away it prints nicely but it does n't help if it ruins your faxes i see other reviewers have the same problem	19
1	i have always bought and liked uniden phones tried this one based on consumer reports recommendation and because i wanted caller id awful reception too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice good range \( which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call ! \) stay clear ! ! ! ! ! !	19
1	this is the worst phone that anyone could ever buy there is constant static and clicking in the background making it hard to hear the person on the other end to make it worse it only has room for 10 programmable numbers and only two choices for ringtones both obnoxiou	19
1	the range on this product is no where near what was advertised i purchased \( 2 \) units and neither will work consistently beyond 4 5 feet from mac attempted to improve operation by relocating mac using usb extension cable and changing id on transmitter with no improvement extremely disappointed	19
1	i was very excited to try this product on my powerbook g4 it worked the very first time but after a restart it no longer worked was quite disappointed as i tried to reset it and try setting ut up again it was fruitless so i dont recommend this product as i'm truly upset with its performance	19
1	first i rated it great and it was for two movies then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling the end	19
1	this transmitter requires me to remove the case from my ipod 5g even with the case removed the device does n't fit snugly and works it way loose as i am driving the sound is fair even though the area where i live has many unused stations i would think it would sound much better than it does poor quality product has too many flaws to justify the high price i'm very disappointed and i'm returning it	19
1	it 's a super idea but i cannot say it works well getting a free station is a real challenge even in the underdeveloped italy and if you get one but you are driving within 5 minutes \( or 5 miles \) you lose the signal however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel is not good for cars but works at home connecting it to the radio it needs to be improved	19
1	waste of time software had some bugs but more importantly performance was horrible i would n't pay 10 dollars for this product yes it is that bad accuracy rate was about 25 and the mistakes were beyond spell check they look like some new form of reformed egyption do n't buy !	19
1	did not do what it says it does only thing this does is remove large scratches no matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff i guess you get what you pay for wait no you do n't all i got was a jewel case two pads and two tiny packets of solution what a rip off did n't even get a manual what kind of advertisement is this \? i know the black market kind	19
1	installation express install is over 200mb full install about 650mb ! ! ! it requires you to upgrade to internet explorer 6 to continue installation \( how it this related to printer installation and what if i do n't use internet explorer i do not \) install takes forever is memory hog then tries to sign you up for some services i used to like hp printers i'm completely disappointed with the software to the point that i would rather have other printer than deal with this type of software	19
1	after nearly two weeks i'm still waiting for kingston to ship out replacement ram the ram was installed and after just one day the ram caused several of the programs on my system to quit functioning after calling kingston several times they still have not shipped the replacement modules yet it 's been two weeks i would strongly consider a different brand next time this company is not responsive	19
1	i 've had a 660 printer a couple of years and gone through 6 color cartridges four of them had a couple of the jets clog after 1 or two weeks running the head cleaner just wastes ink \( a lot \) without opening the clogged jets then you have the choice of throwing away a 30 cartridge you 've hardly used or printing with gaps i will not buy another hp printer i 've wasted more on cartridges then the printer cost	19
1	i bought this cable but it suffered from an unacceptable amount of interference faint green and purple rolling bands ruined my picture replacing it with a shorter cable fixed the problem do n't buy a longer cable than you need and consider spending a little more for a higher quality wire if you need all 50 feet	19
1	despite careful aiming this has exactly and i mean exactly the same signal strength as my cheapie 6 airlink 7db omni and is weaker than my homemade pirouline cantenna probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap but save your money if you 're expecting 15db performance	19
1	i was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop everytime i opened the lid a popping sound would occur turns out the rear right back panel was rubbing the lid casing i took the laptop out and placed it back in thinking it was not properly installed same issue i'm not telling anyone not to buy this product just be cautious and i hope you have better luck then i did	19
1	have used many types of dvd r this the only one i have found that did n't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable tried different locations on the spindle and the same results would have been a good buy if they worked gave it only one star because there was no 1 2 star	19
1	the alarms do n't pay any attention to the settings in sounds and notifications they repeat twice and then quit the light does n't flash except the first time half of the time they do n't work i sent it back for repair and they did n't do a thing to it but send it back to me the next day same problem it is the way it is designed but they wo n't admit it	19
1	the 3m privacy filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen otherwise you can see the screen you can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it all the filter does is make the screen a little darker do n't waste your money	19
1	i paid 300 dollars for a new magellan gps less than a yearand a half ago from boat us and they have already declared it obsolete if you expect any support do not buy magellan	19
1	anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds i know because i just did it the cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire you could even use household scissors to gnaw through having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer however if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer you might as well get something with a stronger cable	19
1	bought my go510 on november 14 as a christmas present for the wife it comes with only 90 days of warranty today is april 6 and the thing is broken for a few days it had trouble finding the satellites then just went dead it was never abused never left the car out of warranty for just 45 days 600 wasted it is junk ! stay away from it	19
1	pen does n't work as fast as i thought it would have very slow to upload text to computer i bought this for a law student and it turns out to be more of a burden to scan and proof the text as you go if you can type at a decent speed i would strongly discurage purchasing this product for note taking	19
1	these headphones have no bass whatsoever i would never buy these please keep shopping as there are better products for the money out there the headphones that came with my mp3 player out of the box are way better then these	19
1	followed the instructions to the letter pcs would not work once connected and even worse stopped xp starting up had to go back to restore point belkin email support is next to useless i would strongely recommend buying a kvm product from another supplier	19
1	besides the fact you have to buy the cables separately as others have mentioned belkin support is horrible the automated system consistenly disconnects the call requiring going through their operator my 4 port kvm stopped functioning after six months there 's no information on the web to help either it 's as if there is no way to fix a kvm that does n't work flash upgrading is a joke i followed the procedure directly from belkin 's website so i had to rma replace it trust me belkin does n't care about its customers and arrogance will be their downfall go with iogear they include all the cables with the kvm switch for the price of belkin 's without cables	19
1	i also was misled into thinking i was getting ten of these tapes not one while the tape is ok it is absolutely not worth the price for a single basic vhs tape i am usually a big amazon fan but this advertisement is very poor	19
1	agree with the prior message i was duped into thinking 10 vhs tapes were being sold don't order this	19
1	the best thing about the magellean 3000t is the large screen sometimes this gadget works like a charm other times it just seems to pay no attention actually the touch screen function decides not to work you can sit there and touch rub hammer to no avail i got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to amazon first i called magellan 's help line \( the phone number was hard to find \) apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon if you hear a click it 's okay finally it works most of the time damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration	19
1	i agree with the poster who complained about the drivers not being available for download in this day and age there is no excuse for a company not making such things available for their customers a voice recorder is tool for on the go so we should have to carry a cd with us as well in case we want to plug the recorder into a different machine \? this is just a case of wanton disrespect of the customer by a big company	19
1	it 's worth it just to take a regular size optical mouse with you this one does n't save that much space it works fine but it 's not comfortable to use	19
1	this is my fourth epson printer and probably my last the epson rx580 needs several ink cartridges if any of them is out of ink you ca n't print at all if you 're out of yellow ink you still cannot print a purely black white document ! ! the system should at least default to black printing when a color runs out i really resent that epson is taking advantage of customers like that	19
1	for those considering the purchase of this unit keep in mind that only podcasts and videos will be displayed on your tv menus and playlists will not the very slight increase in video quality via the use of the s video cable is n't worth it get some 10 00 cables for your ipod and save mone	19
1	i would love to try this first one was shipped broken \( make a clanking noise and woulnd't work \) sent it back and got a new one that did n't read a dvd i may try one more time its pretty heavy but i am hoping the larger screen is better then other small portables or i pod type machines	19
1	i purchased a sony 5 disk cd changer in 1991 that could shuffle between all five disks this model can only shuffle tracks on one disk at a time what were they thinking \? the ability to shuffle tracks between disks was my entire reason for choosing a five disk changer vs a single disk cd dvd player this baby is going back	19
1	i had trouble with installing the firewire port i did not get any help with the company	19
1	i was not sent a firewire cable as was advertised they sent me a useless usb cable when i contacted the seller they did not send me the proper cable do n't buy from this terrible company !	19
1	the picture is good and the combo was convenient however after 1 year the dvd broke now i have just a tv this is the problem with combos it is better to get components separately	19
1	poorly designed i slide my 2400 into it and the case is so tight it pressess buttons on my ipaq for me turning it on in the case cheaply constructed you can buy better for less check out the cases	19
1	so i really like this case besides the velcro basically i have it with me all the time and use it frequently the only thing is that each time i take my hp ipaq 4155 out the velcro makes the loudest noise i have ever heard and everyone looks up and stares at my case i would n't recommend this one i am actually shopping for one that snaps or zips	19
1	i bought this premium priced product because it has both built in voice mail and speakerphone the latter was the key feature i sought well it works intermittently just enough so you can tell \( occasionally \) that it 's on but infrequently enough that you ca n't actually use it to carry on a meaningful conversation it reminds me of the can you hear me now commercials i 'd rather live with courtney than own this piece of junk one more day ! all the other complaints from others are absolutely true as well ugh do not buy this product ! !	19
1	i bought 2 of these and they are horrible ! youu put them in and they sometimes work and sometimes dont its such a pain in the arse !	19
1	i used this maybe 4 times when the in stopped functioning but it mysteriously would work in reverse i wish i read other people 's reviews on this before i bought it horrible waste of money	19
1	we purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house with all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft at first it worked like a charm but then it suddenly started to jam up for no reason we take good care of our electronic stuff so we were very surprised when the shredder stodecided to stop working then last week i added 2 sheets of paper and the shredder broke useless ! ! !	19
1	i placed an order for this kingston memory stick only to have my order cancelled without explanation very lousy customer service	19
1	my first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested the etch tore when examing the inside of the printer i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage the next new cartridge would not work either wasted tech support said to have the printer repaired ya sure \( after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out \) printer repair would cost me more a new one	19
1	i was very disappointed in the lexmark p450 printer the colors were very dull and the picture quality were definitely not up to the lexmark standards that i am used to \( i have several lexmark products \) i returned the printer	19
1	i ordered this as i have many items from amazon and had not received it after 2 months i cancelled the order	19
1	i have now been shipped two iskins for my 60gig and both of them had the holes in the top in the wrong place there are at least three flavors of 60 gig ipods in the marketplace at present and more coming it appears so be careful which one you order the manufacturer 's website is very confusing and unhelpful about identifying the correct model of skin even if you know the model number of your ipod i also agree with the other reviewer that the belt clip is a mistake throw it away	19
1	i bought it and usb was fine but the firewire ports did n't work lost time and money sending it in for warranty service	19
1	sound was n't too bad for price tinny yes but cheap used it a dozen times and then started having trouble getting it to play cds and then it would n't turn on at all	19
1	worked for a month on and off and now doesent work at all	19
1	i took the tv out of the box plugged it in and nothing after pushing the on off switch repeatedly it finally came on picture and sound were terrific so i was very pleased turned it off with the remote of course the tv would n't turn on again with either the remote or the switch pushed the switch about 10 times and it finally came on i called panasonic customer service who could not do anything to fix it by phone so now my new tv is in for a warranty repair less than 24 hours after i received it talk about frustrating ! !	19
1	these actually left my screen dirtier than i started with it left behind annoying streaks and film which i ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution i suggest keeping a soft cloth with some 1 1 water and rubbing alcohol handy it 's cheaper and more effective	19
1	i have used this rw with my sanyo dvd recorder the result is that i cound not play the recording it wil freeze up and some times they can not be formatted they will not function well if they are used for the vr mode i have used other brands such as tdk or fuji they are ok	19
1	this drive has a great aesthetic design but did not work out of the box when i received it amazon delivered promptly as usual but quality of this product is definitely lacking look at the western digital that 's what i now have and have had no issues	19
1	this printer works fine as a usb printer but it does not connect to a network hp will not replace says it must be something wrong with my network nevermind the 2 other printers 2 macs and 3 winxp computers connected to it no more hp for me	19
1	i got this cd player because i thought sony was a good company plus i liked the look of it but after just 5 months after purchase and not even using it that often it has already broken i paid about 40 dollars for this cd player so i am very disappointed if i were you i would buy a different cd player	19
1	memorex jewel case arrived with many cases broken the tkd is has probably thicker and more duarabl	19
1	these headphones have a dececent sound but genuinely no noice cancelling effect the battery powers the speakers a bit which does make them a littel louder but nothing special as you see the price is down to 22 00 which is probably a good price for these \( unfortunatly i bought them at 50 00 and had to return them	19
1	stylish comfortable good sound quality and utterly useless at noise cancelation great for allowing one to conveniently eavesdrop on seat side passenger conversations while listening to your favorite tunes and you 'll be sure to not miss any important safety instructions on your next flight perhaps there 's a reason there was no floor demo set out of the box i suggest you insist on this sure turning on the noise cancelation sliding button would seem to somewhat reduce ambient noise but as far as i can tell the only thing it does is slightly amplify the music volume	19
1	i bought these today so that i could review an mp3 presentation as soon as i put the headphone on i wanted to take them back ! it has the most annoying buzzing sound what philips means what they say noise canceling is that the buzzing sound will drown out all background noise ! well i'm taking these back	19
1	epson 's 3600 is a nice 3 in 1 printer scanner and copier but the ink cartridges suck ! this is my third and last epson printer robert h	19
1	300 500 yards under the best conditions given its heft a waste of mone	19
1	i bought one of these about 3 days ago and it 's already broken i try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my pda not only that but it drains rather than charges the battery this is an extremely overpriced piece of junk you 'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you 're trying to charge into one smart phone pda whatever that does everything you want	19
1	either the item is faulty or my television is too old but it didnt work for me i needed to use the component from vga to avoid taking up my s video and dvi openings on ym video card and the television never picked up the signal instead if you have a component open for video just use the s video converter not from this item	19
1	this thing does n't work nothing but black and white image and off center my video card is ntsc like it said but wo n't work on the 3 computers i have do n't buy this buy a video converter box	19
1	i ordered several ink cartridges at one time and was appalled when i received a slew of large boxes to deliver my order the increased cost of shipping the cartridges separately made one magenta cartridge go from 9 35 to 14 93 all the cartrides arrived within a day of each other i would rather pay for one shipment rather than separate ones	19
1	i bought this adapter thinking i would be able to print documents from my pocketpc i installed the adapter to my 6300 hp printer only to find out that you can only print images i was not completely satisfied with this adapter	19
1	at first i loved the compact iaudio player but after the first week the earphone input \( hole in the player \) did n't hold the input jack securely resulting in no sound i could jiggle it in the hole resulting in sound for about a second but could not get it to work continuously unfortunately i threw away my receipt and box or i would return it	19
1	it seems nice enough and it 's cheap but it is apparently incompatible with the canon powershot digital elphs for use with those cameras buy sandisck instead seriously	19
1	the cables to go 4 port usb ps unit works well when you have manual mode on without sscanning on but i have repeated problems with machines rebooting when the kvm is not switched to that device the video card goes into some blacked out video mode the pc has to be shutdown the box drives the card into some lockup and on display there is a overscan error the box does not properly simulate a monitor to a booting pc you must bo the port and watch the reboot then card is ok until next reboot unattended frustrating the keyboard and mouse are ok but with wireless keyboard mouse combo the box can not be on auto scan mode too many drawbacks	19
1	i wanted some earbuds for my zen player which fit in my ears and would n't fall out these earbuds did fit my ears however a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now i have sound coming out of only one earbud also i have no idea why these are called high quality earbuds unless it was a sales tactic the sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original zen earbuds i am back to using the original buds but i'm 20 lighter in the pocketbook i was dissatisfied with this purchase	19
1	i bought this samsung model in september because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction it went black the day before the super bowl it is now ncaa playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced the service technician has tried 3 times to repair now having replaced every component i am finally on a replacement list with no eta the samsung customer service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned the repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push samsung with no success	19
1	this wireless speaker system failed to work right out of the box however i had not problem with the return which included return postage i will purchase from amazon again	19
1	purchased a total of 20 of these i previously sold the american international brand sirius antenna but there was a temporary shortage in the market four of the twenty terk brand units were dead on installation sadly i thought terk was a quality brand my mistake !	19
1	i own one of these it came packaged in my dell xps renegade sound in a windows environment is good as indicated by other reviews but in a gaming environment for example world of warcraft and not just this game i and other user 's have experienced the squeal of death wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal and may hard lock your computer either way this can only be corrected by rebooting check out the forums before buying any creative labs products buyer beware !	19
1	this cd storage unit isnt the greatest cd rack but if you want something that will do the job and isnt too costly this is the thing for you it is made from plasti	19
1	this tv only worked for three weeks then for no apparant reason it suddenly would not turn on i sent it back to coby for servicing and they sent it back still broken and with a new crack on it no one should by from coby	19
1	i just got it and am fighting my way through getting it to work in vista ultimate it claims to have a qam tuner but i 'll be damned if it can find any digital hd channels on my cable my qam tv gets many very disappointed documentation is at best lacking look elsewhere	19

1	along with reception of new hd stations i expected high quality fm am to go with my complete top line stereo system instead the hdt 1 gives me very poor quality even less than a table top clock radio very high output can only turn amp up to lowest level and painful to listen to no response to inquiries from sangean	19
1	i loved these earbuds for 5 weeks right up until they stopped working the wires to the ipod \( the stationary wires not the ones that wind up \) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing for a while it worked if i taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case but quickly stopped working altogether too bad they 're comfortable the sound is fine \( great on the bus \) and the retraction works good	19
1	heres the thing about batteries they eat people yeah you can never trust a battery cause those things are heartless especially rayovac those give me the creeps shudder so the next time you think about buying batteries think about b e p batteries eat people dont even think about it punk	19
1	the suspicious side of me wants to believe that hp did a promo with their deskjet 612c i e they sold the printer cheap or with big rebates as part of a system deal and decided to make up for their loss leader by limiting production and raising the price on the cartridge replacements i would be surprised if there is any difference between the 612c black replacement cartridge c6614 and the much more common cartridge for the 660c other than a little plastic tab on the cartridge case	19

1	do n't buy these batteries because they do n't last long like energizer or duracell these eveready batteries ai n't never ready	19
1	these batteries did n't last at all they worked ok in my remote control for my radio but on everything else the quality was either below average or just horrid my digital camera did n't even turn on with these only recommended with low powered devices actually i 'd recommend a rayovac or an energizer rather than these i know they 're only heavy duty batteries but the quality is still below average	19
1	the overall construction of the pedal is pretty sturdy aside from the fact that most of it is made of plastic the sound it produces ranges from a hard overdrive to the hariest shreding distortion the pedal deminishes tone quite a bit and does n't have a very good range \( very high notes are not processed correctly and deliver poor results \) not bad for the money but not an investment in the least bit i just got this because i had a gift certificate that i wanted to get rid of otherwise i would not have purchased the item	19
1	but 20 dollars more and hideous i have a platinum intuos2 tablet \( a high school graduation present from 2004 \) and when i broke the pen i ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it 's being slightly cheaper on wacom 's site here the platinum is 20 dollars more \( and in my opinion much uglier \) i recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen	19

1	this makes no sense if the industry standard is 4x6 why did they kodak cut the paper to 4x6 5 and then advertise on the carton that it is 4x6 yes i see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads actual paper size is 4x6 5 i still do n't understand why they did this now i have cut the pictures down to the correct size what a waste of my time ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	19

1	i have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired the customer services rep told me that it will be 110 for a repair which i can almost buy a new one if i pay the shipping on top of that 110 i have other eight \( 8 \) lcd monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality i 'll newver buy any proview products ever i will give zero star if there is one	19

1	i was hopeful about using this mouse for gaming and its response time did deliver it is more precise in it 's cursor control than any other mouse i 've used however it was apparently designed for someone with smaller hands than me i find it 's side buttons are difficult to use they 're very small and their action is not to my liking further i was hoping that third party drivers would provide the ability to use all of the buttons when using mac os x tiger the steer mouse driver provided the best support and it supports everything except the right side buttons i 've found nothing that supports those buttons on the mac platform to date	19
1	comes preconfigured with a private ip address upon changing the units' address to match my home network it locked up and became unuseable i sent it back poor product i might add that i make my living configuring networks this is a poor product period	19

1	the printer works great as a usb printer a fax machine and copier it may as well not even have a network port on it the networking driver will find the printer but then it goes back to searching fora printer and this loop continues till you give up i ca n't tell if thr network scanning works because of the above driver problem i can tell you that a dell 1600 works great as a network printer network scanner fax copier we have 3 of these and we tried this hp 3055 and i would not reccommend it to anyon	19

1	i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here but when i actually used for a few days i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter i would not recommend this to anyone	19
1	do n't believe the claim that you can just plug it in and it 's ready to use this product is set up for windows and the instructions for installing the drive for a mac fail to mention that you have to reformat the drive to remove the windows software it 's easy to become hopelessly fouled up do n't expect any help from western digital if you can actually get connected to them and your call is n't dropped while you wait for 40 minutes or so you 'll get a customer rep who reads to you from the same useless manual that came from the drive their web site help is equally useless	19
1	purchased for my daughter an english teacher scrabble lover she said she 'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the franklin she 'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game she said it would end up on a shelf in her house she 'd rather have a paperback scrabble dictionary i returned the franklin she did n't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play scrabble in class	19
1	do n't buy it in the 6 months i had the phone the screen burnt out so i can see the numbers the answering machine is horrible and i get better reception from my baby monitor i had a cheap panasonic beforehand which was much better this was a complete waste of hooking it up to your pc to get those cool features is just a pain i'm having a tough time returning this be careful	19

1	this item produced and marketed exclusively for the iaudio x5 is entirely useless the carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself the only way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iaudio into the tiny case the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger i returned mine immediately if you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed ill fitting unacceptable piece of worthless junk	19
1	i just wasted 16 35 on this piece of junk it arrived quickly and became unusable even faster for those of you used to disposable screen covers there is only one in this package ! the instructions say you can clean it but it came out of the packaging with lint on it which immediately adhered to the sticky side and could not be cleaned off since the package was opened it could not be returned	19
1	this is a good product not as good as an mp3 player with internal memory as it is bulkier but it is great for the price the only drawback is it is somewhat larger than a player with internal memory running with it can be uncomfortable at times if you are a runner you may prefer a smaller mp3 player one you can put in your shorts pocket	19

1	with no mode settings \( repeat shuffle etc \) or shock protection this cd player is pretty undesirable but if you 're just looking for something to hold you over then this 'll do it has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright it could be with just mine but every pair of headphones new and old that i use with it the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers they work fine like i said if you just want a temporary thing then i guess this is good for you	19
1	i thought this item came with or you had a choice of color it did not it is silver with black trim it is also not very portible you have to play it while its sitting on a flat level surface	19
1	i find these ear buds to be absolutely uncomfortable i would rate the product a zero if it were an option i ca n't even use them because they 're too uncomfortable to wear not worth the money even though they 're cheap	19
1	just a heads up for people looking to use this scanner to scan slides you will have to unmount the slides in order to be able to scan them given the verbiage on the box it caught me as enough of a surprise that i returned the scanner i'm not ok with deception like that	19

0	not as easy to use as a larger panasonic i used to own butotherwise fine good sound using cd player and radio buying via amazon as usual is super	19
0	it worked much better than expected the page clips also were very good but one fell off about 5 minutes into owning using the item \( i put it back on but fell off a couple more times \) i also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well	19
0	it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin	19
0	this is perfect for my ipod and keeps it totally secure while driving great price and you get different sizes to match your car perfectly	19
0	always something that might come in handy my last remote quit working after a year	19

0	i had two unworking disks \( one a ps2 game and the other a psx game \) so i picked this up and both work fine now ! the only thing is you 'll have to run it through a couple times if you run it through once you 'll see little difference but for the price and since it does work eventually i still give it a 5 out of 5	19

0	i love my tooldial and its' software my only complaint is that you must have a very large proccessor to run it effectively i frequently find that it gums up photoshop and in design a little overall great product and i expect them to have some updates to work out the bugs works very well in tandem with a wacom tablet	19
0	the sandisk reader is impossible to misuse it loads quickly and it 's compact shape offers most options for memory it can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet i would prefer a little more weight so that it does n't move around on my desk so i'm giving it only 4 stars if i had to replace this reader i would buy another sandisk	19
0	i agree that these are not top of the line but they are n't bad at all i get coasters occassionally even from top of the line media i always burn at half the speed the media is designed for 2x in this case it takes longer but i get good results i am rarely in a hurry to burn a dvd i would buy these again updated on 7 3 2005 i have bought a new computer recently and i have been burning these dvds with full speed supported by the writer and no coasters what so ever very happy with this product	19
0	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it it 's the best feeling keyboard i 've ever owned the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past highly recommended	19
0	i'm very happy with the set although not listed in the specs it must have a qam tuner because i am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all i have is basic cable i was thrilled when i made this discovery watching football games in hd without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness the picture quality for analog channels is only so so i really wish the remote was illuminated also amazon took much longer to deliver the tv than was promised other than these negatives i'm very happy	19
0	we have the original itrips but wanted this one for travel since it is much eaiser to tune in the originals work great around town because it is always set on the same station after reading the instructions i plugged the new itrip in and it worked perfectly just like the originals not only did it work but it worked from 40 feet away that is better than i expected after reading all the feedback i'm not sure what everyones problem is it 's not a radio tower it 's a transmitter the size of your finger i get the feeling that some people think it should power the city block	19
0	i have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance the disaster recovery software provided with this drive is it 's biggest star you can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to exactly the way it was when you created the disk or you can simply replace selected files if you want it does not miss a single thing fanstastic the software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an quot abc quot book i would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use	19

0	overall a very nice charger though recharge times are n't even close to what is advertised the display is very nice as is the ability to charge individual batteries instead of having to do it in a pair the 900 mah hold such a small charge that they are almost worthless	19
0	i bought the sansa m240 two months ago and am quite happy with it it 's light weight holds plenty of media \( i have yet to fill it up \) and the sound is suprisingly good no complaints	19
0	the other effusive reviews are spot on the picture is fabulous on new dvds \( lord of the rings nemo harry potter \) a 20 cables to go hdmi cable does a great job we have the sony kdf 42e2000 42 3lcd rear projection hdtv and are thrilled with the combination a few annoyances the machine responds and loads slowly but that 's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price and certain dvds of old movies \( some like it hot the king and i \) stretch the picture horizontally making things look squat i'm sure there 's a solution but just ca n't figure it out any tips	19
0	as your dvd cd collections grow these are ideal for protecting and storing your treasures easy to open and take up little storage space the center lock tab is secure but allows you to remove the discs from the case with ease just a great product	19
0	excellent value these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price if you use a lot of aa 's this is the way to go made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the 18 range	19
0	very pleased w item compact easy to move from place to place	19
0	i bought this to clean up all of my kids dvds they have a ton of discs that are dirty scratched etc i have cleaned over 30 discs so far and have fixed all but one \( it was really scratched up \) i am suprised at the negative reviews on this item since i have considered this one of my smartest buys this year	19
0	just wanted to echo what others have said that these batteries seem to really last i received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it almost as powerful as the 2500s here and the batteries ran out after a few hours replaced those batteries with these and these just seem to last on and on am very happy with them	19
0	you really ca n't go wrong with this one not great response but what do you expect for less than 300 \? on the other hand the possibilities for this surround system are endless want something just for the effects to complilment your bedroom wide screen \? how about using it for a dedicated gaming sound system \( this is how my daughter has it configured \) it 's our second one first one died as a result of recent electrical storm \( yes the circuit was 'protected' but so what \) could n't be happier for the investment	19
0	this appears to be a good piece of equipment i hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well	19

0	quick reader poor design it does a great job copying images to my mac but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo poo it stays on tight which is good until you try to open it the force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball groove hinges useless it 's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off leaving the reader exposed to the elements	19
0	great for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your ipo	19
0	i 've never had any problems with memorex dvd 's or cd 's when i was ordering and read some of the reviews here i had to go back and look at what i was using to make sure i 've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones i do n't know why some users are having problems but these dvd 's always worked great for me and i record on average over one a day	19

0	overall this is a very good remote it replaced 5 of my remotes which is all except my bose which is rf controlled it even replaced my windows media center edition remote and works with my ps2 with no problems my negatives for this device are that the layout is a little less comfortable and intuitive than some of my other remotes and the default functions are n't necessarily the most used functions therefore requiring additional time to set up these negative however are more than acceptable when you remember that it works with so many devices i am definitely happy with this remote and would undoubtably purchase again	19
0	easiest remote to program has tremendous ability to tweek will keep recommending to all my customers	19
0	i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it it 's the best feeling keyboard i 've ever owned the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past highly recommended	19

0	first i would buy it again if i needed to this 15 takes up less space on the kitchen counter i e speakers are on the bottom second picture and sound are excellent i e clear i would not buy this item if i wanted a true vesa mount to monitor configuration the stand not the monitor has the screw holes for the vesa wall mount not enough or clear info in the description however it is just as easy to turn on the counter as on the wall if you need counter space then buy something else	19

0	i recently purchased this item and i am very happy with its performance and quality i use it daily in the gym it delivers excellent sound and you dont even realize you have it on due to its light weight	19

0	i recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office the reception on this unit is great bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations the sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in if you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound	19
0	this is an awesome tablet ! it has great pressure sensitivity and the pen allows for fantastic freehand drawing in programs like illustrator photoshop and painter the pen is a more natural feeling tool to use in these applications than a mouse the size of the tablet allows you to get into greater detail without having to zoom in all the time	19
0	this device is great for carriying around with your camera you can review and share the pictures with any pc with usb available data can also be recorded and easily recovered	19
0	i bought a 1gb with my new camera because i was giving my other camera and it 's 256 memory card to my sister the smaller card would fill quickly and i 'd have to develope the pictures or deleat them i paid about 9 00 more for my card in sept and thought that was a deal now you can get this card for 20 00 that 's a steal for a 1 gb also i like the little case provided to keep the card safe when i take it to the store to develope the pictures love it	19
0	these batteries have been awesome my digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100 's of photographs flash recharge is very quick highly recommended	19
0	i 've been using these earbuds for several months now and they 're far better than the ones that come with the ipod they 're more comfortable and there 's so much more bass although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass my pair has gone through the washing machine twice and the dryer once and they still sound just as good as the day i got them ! \( i did have to glue one of the earpieces back together though \) i thought i 'd certainly destroy them by getting them wet but these things are industrial strength	19
0	i am a mild audophile and i love these headphones they have great base response treble and isolation if you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop do n't get get these ! you wo n't be able to hear a thing outside of the music	19

0	i have been using memorex dvd r blank media for more than a year and have gotten fine recordings with my new dvd player recorder not all of my recordings were successful no product i know is 100 perfect but the majority have been successful with memorex dvd blank media this 50 pack spindle was purchased from amazon because i know i can rely on them to give you the best in quality and value plus free shipping moreover i have never really been disappointed with anything purchased from amazon after trying many dvd r blank media i found memorex dvd r spindles to be affordable and reliable for a better than average performance	19
0	not quite as powerful as i was hoping for but the sound is alright and in a small room it 'll do fine careful there is no plug in at the back so you can only connect mp3 or auxiliary stuff through the little front jack otherwise it 's easy to use and pretty cool looking ideal for quiet listening lame if you host a big party and need loud stuff	19
0	the pro and cons described by other reviews are valid i was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette mp3 cd and radio capability so did n't have much of an option but to get this one i am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality overall i think its a good buy	19
0	i love this arm band i have had it for about 6 months now you dont have to take your ipod out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer i also only use my ipod for the gym so its nice that this arm band provides great protection \( better than ipod 's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on \) as well as not coming off while working out	19
0	i bought the 128mb card 8 9 mnths ago at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller ! finally it gave a 'error reading card' message and stopped working customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt they replaced the card is 7 days they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered 'lost' in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it ! i was impressed with the excellent support but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life would i buy it again \? yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well	19
0	i'm very happy with this desktop system great sound great reception great price	19
0	i am very pleased with this item it is fits comfortably holds my cd player snugly and has room for my id keys extra batteries cd 's	19
0	i bought this memory card for my camera sd500 at first i was very dispointed when i only see 1gb on my laptop after googled around i realized i need to update my laptop sd reader driver to recognized sd card that is over 1gb i'm able to see full 2gb after driver update just make sure you update your device laptop firmware driver first	19
0	same as everybody else i ordered mine a couple of days back and it has n't shipped i want it ! ! ! ! !	19
0	cool ! i can expand my single usb port laptop more flexible from single peripheral to be quadruplet i can plug flashdisk mouse external and digital camera in same time worth money for usefull gadget	19
0	i first saw these speakers at the apple store and i really liked the sound and the look i went on amazon and found a better price and i couldnt be happier with them as long as you have a decent soundcard these speakers really are great i have had no problem with them at all they look really cool they 're loud they 're small the woofer gives you a lot of bass \( which you can turn down \) and the sound from the speakers is clear buy these	19
0	what else do you need to know \? you plug in your pcs and a cable to your router and go i used a netgear hub for years replaced it with this linksys switch and my network speed improved immediately	19
0	it 's speedy and space saving and inexpensive i bought this to replace my belkin because the belkin needed to be plugged in this one is powered by your computer so there 's no extra power cords which is a big plus to me the only thing i dislike about this is the fact that the hub takes up two usb ports instead of just one like the belkin	19
0	you will appreciate this product only if you do n't have enough usb ports in my case i had plenty of ports but needed an extension cable which would help me in plugging the flash drives whithout bending down and plunging into the cave of wires \( i keep my cpu under the table \) the only complaint i have is the the wire lenght is not long enough overall good value for price	19
0	the mouse is perfect for games i use it to play et and is great the software provided by logitech is configurable in all ways	19
0	i 've had this device for two years just today i sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry \( not on purpose \) the thing still works ! ! i will not however try sending it into the dryer though beause i'm pretty sure that would fry this thing	19
0	i ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you must plug in hey guys try it without an outside energy source i just hope i m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered usb port i have a very high end system though with wattage to sprare but no more pci slots damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards why do 2 of em have to take up so much room oh well trade offs are a bi but a reality and 7 extra usb slots are awfully nice	19
0	i was about to retire an old standalone dvd recorder because it would no longer let me create menus or finalize discs i bought this lens cleaner and voila ! the recorder is working again super easy to use \( it 's simply a dvd that you insert into your machine and the menus tell you what to do \) highly recommended	19
0	just a note to those who 've been having trouble opening these cases without breaking them if you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together you 'll be able to open and close it ok do n't sand too much and just do the top knob or it wo n't hold together i like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive so i wanted to make them work hope it works for you	19
0	the cf card works fine but it 's response is kind of slow compaired to the 32mb cf card came with my canon powershot a95 i got this card 3 weeks ago and so far their has n't been any problems	19
0	i do all my burning on a standard windows media player and it 's almost entirely data and music no video for my purposes these cd 's sound great in some cases it actually seems like the discs have enhanced the sound spectrum somewhat that may be a trick my ears are playing on me but nevertheless i'm a big fan of the memorex and they 're a steal if you catch the sale price recommended	19
0	these earphones are incredible ! they are comprised of excellent bass and treble you experience everything much nicely these earphones compared to the ipod headphones are excellent unlike those raggety things i bought these from ebay for 8 and for that amount of price you ca n't regret buying these sensational earphones	19
0	just my two cents i bought these from the sony store for 15 bucks two years ago they 've lasted me this long for light office use so at 7 year this seems to be a good budget earphones i'm not an audiophile so i do n't need expensive earphones however they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack the wires got loose and the sound just stopped moral of the story do n't twist or touch the wires cable pros lightweight budget oriented comfortable fit for my earscons eventually broke cheap earphone covers will get lost easil	19

0	drive got to me timly installed per instructions and works wel	19
0	picture sound all great the only problem is that you must have an advanced degree in english engineering and computer science to set the television up without my cable company making a house call setup is impossibl	19
0	this mount is nicely designed and well made it fit the tv perfectly our only criticism is that the screws provided for attaching it to the wall were of poor quality the heads stripped out right away and it took a trip to the hardware store to get replacements	19
0	i read some of the reviews about installation issues and they concerned me initially but when it came time to get the printer up and running on my wireless network there really were n't any issues just following the directions \( and avoiding the easysecure option \) worked fine i would highly recommend this printer the quality of the printing is excellent the feature function set is quite high for a moderate price and it 's a great home office printer that has lots to offer	19

0	this xd memory card works perfectly with my camera fujifilm finepix f650 good buy for the price	19
0	i bought this because i did not want to mount my garmin 350 nuvi to the windshield this device makes is much easier to switch the unit to different cars i drove normally and the unit did not slide around on my dashboard i can also mount the unit on a center console and it works there too please note that this is a complete unit for portable mounting and it is much cheaper than buying the sandbag mounting arm separately	19
0	the item works perfectly if you do not place it near other mechanical devices i e tv air purifier elec clock etc fortunately it has n't alerted us yet so that will remain to be experienced you have to turn it anumber of directions until you get the best reception then leave it in that position	19
0	this is the best value you can get awesome picture with 10 000 1 contrast ratio my xbox 360 looks amazing with 1080i resolution definitely worth the money you would not be disappointed with this tv	19
0	i bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it 's worked beautifully clear and easy to use once downloaded onto my computer i used the olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews this allowed me to listen on headphones control the progression \( and backtracking \) of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly this voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time i had to take trascribing the interviews well worth the price i 'd recommend this combo highly especially to other journalists	19
0	i 've been very pleased with this external drive 500gb my only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it now it seems to always mount its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive the other thing would be that it could use one more firewire 400 port \( there is only one \) i do n't use 800 yet so i need to daisy it off of my smartdisk firelite that happens to have 2 all in all get this drive	19
0	solid product headphone speaker jack on my laptop died and manufacturer wanted 40 just to cover shipping fees to have it fixed ! i bought this great little unit instead for under 30 good audio actually it saved my laptop once too laptop fell from 2 3 feet but landed right on the rubberized turtle beach micro which took most of the force it was bent 90 degrees at the usb connector but it still worked ! proof of solid construction	19
0	this is our first lcd tv our tube tv finally died my wife actually picked out this unit and consumer reports also recommended this unit we purchased it directly from amazon on january 23 2007 i wanted to wait a couple of months before i write my review to see if anything happens but to my surprise the tv is still running and there have been no problems we have digital hd and the pictures are great it took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast however if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat but overall its a good buy for us	19
0	this is a great product it was easy to mount and looks great the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches i have a 32 lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees this has n't caused any problems and i'm sure this is well within its design strength highly reccommended	19
0	this is a high quality precision made piece i'm very particular about the construction of things that i buy and this peerless arm more than met my expectations it was easy to attach to the back of my 32 lcd television and equally easy to mount to the wall i read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble not so here everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen all hardware is included along with clear complete instructions i 'd be surprised if you could find something better	19
0	pros like a quality piano the keys give a sense of weight the bend in the keyboard tool some getting used too but now am typing a full speed the mouse offers great control though i have n't much used all the buttons that are one the form cons the only gotcha is if the computer freezes there is no way to control alt delete also setting the favorite keys to non microsoft items tends to reset after updates and restarts	19
0	one warning for users with over head lights the 6000 keyboard that has tranparent \( light gray \) keys is very hard to read if the lighting is not quite right i have a light directly above my desk and the reflected glare off the keys makes all the letters and numbers disappear go for a black key or similar model	19
0	after going through nearly 6 mouses \( including several of the microsoft mouses \) i settled on this because its round contuour shape and large effective button area that extend very far back it also works with my kvm switch which is a key consideration the buttons are a bit stiff but i expect them to loosen up a bit after some use i highly recommend this mouse	19
0	they are everything the other reviewers said they were and i too ca n't wait until the printing is darker and in color ! wish it did n't take so long to print and hope the darker images and color only require an upgrade	19
0	i used two 12 foot cables with a coupler for a 24 foot pcm connection between my satellite receiver and my home theater system the dolby 5 1 is excellent	19
0	this is one of the best in its class for the low price quick and responsive and very convenient for a frequent web browser the back and forward buttons on it work like a charm and are perfect for the web	19
0	replaced my old 22 cinema display that was 5 years old what a difference clear screen flawless finish solid and adjustable stand easy hook up it took longer to clean the dust off my computer than hook this up !	19
0	i got this monitor along with a keyboard when i get home i plug my laptop into both and i have a huge screen to do my work on the colors are terrific the mouse works seamlessly across the laptop screen and the big auxilliary screen wish i had done this a long time ago	19
0	just remember to use the proper cable cat 5e or cat 6	19
0	i have this radio for two weeks now i am very satisfied with the reception of am fm and short wave very sensitive has great sound the only negative is the lack of being able to preset the stations would buy the radio again worth the money	19
0	how can you go wrong with a price so low they 're good for both parents and kids to use not to mention they 're easy for young kids to operate ! keep in touch	19
0	i'm using this monster cable to connect my ipod to my receiver via an ipod dock and it works flawlessly sound is crisp and clear plus it 's a lot cheaper than getting the actual monster ipod av cable the length of the cable makes it convenient but not too cumbersome it 's a great way to increase the functionality of your ipod	19
0	within about 12 seconds of opening the box i was listening to my ipod on my home stereo wires are well made there may be cheaper options that work as well but these will last forever	19
0	not quite as bright a conventional flashlight but certainly bright enough no battery feature ca n't be beat manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind i 've never left mine on that long but i 've only needed to wind it once in over a year this is an excellent flashlight i 've bought several	19
0	i was unsure of whether to purchase this product when i saw that my printer \( hp deskjet 712c \) was not on the list put out by the manufacturer but after reading some others' reviews i tried it anyway because the price was right it may look a little cheesy but it works i did n't even need the cd that comes with it in order to use the product i just plugged it in to my printer and then into my new dell laptop and it worked i think i may have had to restart and add my printer but that was it very good product	19
0	do you have an old printer you would like to tie to that new lap top \? i did and at first i did n't think it could be done but a little quick research on amazon and i found this beauty the sabrent cable is very well made and has the look of quality and ruggedness i just plugged it in and everything took off without a hitch \( pc w windows xp	19
0	great picture great price superb fast delivery by amazon \( via egl trucking \) no complaints except for a faint buzzing sound on the plasma tv i have heard that all plasma 's buzz a bit this would not stop me from purchasing this tv again	19
0	i was looking for a tv that offered bang for buck so i knew samsung is the way to go except my wife was not eager as i was but soon after buying it the planet earth hd discovery channel show was on now i can not get my wife to stop talking about hd we love the tv not the best tv but best for the price nice design and easy to use	19
0	i have had my samsung for about three weeks now no problems i am extremely hapy with the picture quality and the number of inputs we also bought the 42 plasma for my parents we 've been extremely happy with it as well in addition to the television i am extrmemly happy with amazon and the delivery process everythin was handled very professionally the tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged i will buy next tv through amazon as well	19
0	these speakers deliver a clear crisp and vibrant sound with a richness expected of a higher end speaker i would recommend these to anyone interested in a good quality sound but keeping an eye on price	19
0	after reading several reviews on this unit we purchased it the majority of our equipment supported gigabit and so we decided it was time to get in the game it took less then 15 minutes to install in our rack and change over to it all i can say is wow ! the performance is phenomenal we have had no issue with it since switching over and it just plain works i cannot believe that we can obtain that level of speed in network applications for the price we paid highly recommended	19
0	not much to say here it works easily adjustable with just your feet feels good wearing socks	19
0	i want the dvds i'm making to last to as close to forever as possible so i did a lot of research before deciding what dvds to buy verbatim came out as 1 for durability i chose the dvd r format for maximum compatibility with various devices and i 've only had a few errors after burning about 75 dvds amazon 's sale price for these was great if you 're just looking for short term backup media i'm sure you can find cheaper but these are a different class of dvds	19
0	with my new lcd television the hook up was a snap and what a difference with the new hdmi compatible up scale dvd i installed the audio and visual difference for dvd and hd television programing is amazing with the cost at half the price at retail stores very happy and highly recommended	19

0	this performs better than the unit offered at the apple store at about 20 of the cost ! plus it has an indicator light and the folding plug is handy for travel good deal	19
0	this arm band is surprisingly good i initially got it for my boyfriend for his iriver but i was afraid it would n't fit his arms since he 's very muscular surprisingly it stretched enough and was n't tight ! he loves it i thought there might be too much motion on mine when i run or use the eliptical but no it 's fine	19
0	this product is exactly as described and arrived very quickly a seller ! will definately buy from again	19
0	this receiver puts out a lot of power it also has a bit of weight to it it comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound the remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a dvd player cd player radio and many other devices the display is nice you really have to read the manual before you start plugging away if you 're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up	19
0	i just got mine from amazon \( after a lengthly delay \) it is an awesome memory card it comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras i tested it on the camera and it worked great the real test was the compatibility with the sony psp no issues there the card worked flawlessly i 've already used up 600 mb its a must buy ! plus at 99 99 its much less than other retailers btw i ordered it at 104 99 then contacted amazon about the price drop they credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one day shipping at no charge because of the delay overall great service too	19
0	i use this 1gb card in my sony playstation portable and it is awesome ! the tranfer rate using the usb 2 0 cable to the psp is very good and i love having all that storage space for movies music and images i got the ultra ii because i had read that sandisk outperformed sony in speed tests and i have to agree the tranfer rate seems much faster than with the 32mb sony card that came with the psp for an extra 5 10 i got the ultra ii that has a warranty and better performance i think it is well worth it	19
0	when compared to other 1st generation ipod shuffle armbands this one is just as good if not better and you ca n't beat the price definitely worth every penny	19
0	the bci 3ebk is good quality black ink for an inkjet printer i have used this ink for a couple of years now and do n't recall it smudging on the pages i print the price on this product \( compared to hp products \) is fair but i am able to print a 100 to 200 pages before running out of ink of course you will get more pages out of this cartridge if you print more color graphics than text	19
0	good price just not sure it is needed	19
0	the first one i ordered worked for about four days and then stopped recognizing the usb devices i was plugging into it although i had considered just getting a refund amazon was quick to replace the card with no hassles the replacement card has been working fine for a couple of months now the usb 2 is much faster than the original usb ports that were a part of my original computer and this particular card was a reasonable price	19
0	i own the hp 475 and since it 's slightly larger then the rest the printer barely fits in the case it does fit but it is very tight i would not recommend this for the 475 probably i should n't have bought this but i really liked the case	19
0	this cable has worked fine for me with no problems i'm using it to connect an inexpensive keyboard to a laptop	19
0	outstanding item plenty of room to carry dvds enough padding to protect the player but not too bulky	19
0	i wish targus made the same bag just a few inches wider my toshiba 2600 barely squeezes in the bag however it does fit and i was able to mount it between the two seats of our 2004 toyota sienna with no problems there 's also ample room for cords and dvds i like how this bag doubles as a storage case and a way to mount it in the car for viewing all in all a very nice product	19
0	the creative zen is outstanding took a little while to get use to the controls but the sound is incredible i bought one for my wife as well and see loves it i did spend a little extra money for better earbuds for the price that i paid for 8gb you ca n't go wrong	19
0	i totally love this cd wallet it is not too big and not too small the construction of this piece is very sturdy i 've owned this for a while now and it still looks new the color is a classic the only problem i have with it is that the cd pockets are very flimsy other than that the exterior of this piece is unbelievable i love it ! ! ! i actually bought another one oh another note do be careful because the if you do n't handle the zipper with care it tends to get caught but nothing major	19
0	these headphones sound pretty good but they are n't the best when running the volume controller gets in the way and bounces it is also easy to change the volume which is annoying i also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange i realize it is done intentionally but it does nothing for me overall for just listening at your desk or in your room these are great headphones for running i would recommend something else	19
0	i needed a way to power my laptop and my batteries for my camcorder as well as my digital camera this was done without a problem when my wife and i visited slovakia	19
0	i installed this antenna in my pawn shop where we keep most of our electronics running all day i could never get good reception with standard antennas and now this single antenna does the job better than any i have ever seen keep in mind that i have a full surveillance systen alarm syster phone system 20 home stereos a dozen or more computers and on and on the terk fm 50 has exceeded my expectations thanks joel dba pawn plus	19
0	radio reception in my apartment is terrible i have purchased a few indoor antennas even a different terk model but none of them helped very much i had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations and my digital fm radio only received one digital channel this unit however works great i get every station i want and the digital fm works great the only thing i would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky so if you 're concerned about asthetics you 'll have to figure out where you can conceal it also i did n't get any additional benefit from the amplifier but the antenna worked so well that i did n't need it	19
0	after reading several reviews on portable speakers i decided to purchase the sonic impact i f2 for my ipod it has great sound quality the case is durable it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere you can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive this is by far the best accessory i 've purchased for my ipod did i mention that it has a remote control ! !	19
0	contrary to popular belief i even had a good experience the one time i needed technical support a few random disconnects but overall a great product	19
0	they say it 's quiet and it holds tons of data they were correct fast access speed easy installation an overall fine product have not used the feature that let 's you back up your entire drive but we use it in our lan for shared files and it 's comforting to know that we 've got these files stored redundantly this box does just what it claims to do the warranty of merchantability \( from my old law class ! \)	19
0	very easy to assemble has very classic lines lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation hard to find add on shelf in maple holds a lot of equipment	19
0	buying from amazon was cheapest price especially with free shipping stepped up for more power per channel stayed in the sony family \( previous sony surround output to center speaker quit \) dislike the speaker hook ups in back difficult to attach speaker wires and screw down connections overall happy with purchase	19
0	very satisfied with sound quality and ease of use before purchasing i did believe that these were noise canceling however that is not the case the foam inserts do reduce background noise enough that i am very satisfied with the result replacement foam inserts must be purchased online	19
0	i bought these for my dvd player they work wonderfully ! the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but did n't measure up these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies especially the dialogue the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever for those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds	19
0	i lost my monster cable brand m to m cable for my ipod and looked for a different kind and ran across this one at half the price plugged everything in and it works super good sound quality and saved some bucks hard to find these cables so i highly recommend it	19
0	i saw the small size of this case and was in love it has plenty of space for dvds and cords \( though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold \) it is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky it 's great you wont regret it	19
0	great price ! cant compare it to the more expensive monster cables but i cant imagine it being worth paying 50 dollars more for pretty much the same components	19
0	for its price and definately for its length its an awesome alternative to it 's 100 monster counterpart	19
0	i purchased three of these for three kodak easyshare camerasi gave as gifts it was a great buy for much less than whatyou can get at any local stores	19
0	good sound and comfortable for the price like the fact that the cord is on one side and does not go around you neck	19
0	the best at this price like the color and functions mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized great optional backlight feature	19
0	i really needed a printer with a scanner so i could store my important files digitally this printer works great i would recommend to change to the lower resolution so it will operate faster it can scan color also but that takes a loooong time b w has been sufficient for me scans quickly for those printout quality is excellent	19
0	good product great combination of screen protection along with a small flexable piece to cover the keypad	19
0	pros very inexpensive can play songs directly from a flash drive instead of an mp3 playercons ca n't shuffle tracks or make a playlist if you use a flash driveoverall i'm very happy with this device i live in a big city and had no trouble finding an fm station with little to no interference i love being able to play tracks directly from a flash drive without having to bring my mp3 player with me in the car all the time the sound quality is good but not perfect similar to playing a cassette instead of a cd for the low price i ca n't complain though	19
0	i purchased this remote to replace a broken tv dvd vcr combo remote before buying it i checked specs of several brands and types to see if they could be programmed for my combo this was the only one that definitely could it has worked well a couple features are not available but i expect that with any replacement control i 've also programmed it to my bose radio and my dish network box and the controls have worked just fine now my coffee table is a lot less cluttered	19
0	i bought this card to be used with an ipaq hw6945 it has enough capacity for gps maps programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from sandisk that is supported by the ipaq the reading writing speed is ok too very good product for only 18 bucks	19
0	i purchased this particular cb because of the front firing speaker the size is perfect for in dash installations and it is very user friendly after installation i tested it out to 8 miles which was more then i expected overall i'm very pleased with the price and quality of this product	19
0	ive owned a couple cb 's and this is definitely one of the better ones \( the only ones that are better are substancially more expensive \) works great and can be mounted in dash because of the front firing speaker tons of features including scanning and weather \( which actually comes in very handy \) the only feature it lacks \( and i wish it had \) is the ability to hook up to a pa other than that its great	19
0	very very loud enough to make you 're ears ring \( thats a good sign \) bass is very deep and the silver volume dots on one of the speakers are touch sensitive like the ipod now thats cool great great desktop speakers and they can hook up right to your ipod worth the money	19
0	well made hard case that is virtually a necessity to protect the tungsten e2 which comes with a flimsy cheap flip case	19
0	great sound fun colored lights great design love this radio	19
0	we love this tuner and the kids have had funfinding out what key different sounds make they change their voice tap on things withpencils etc	19
0	i bought this mouse for my fiancee about three months ago and she has not complained once she uses it extensively in her office and reports that it is accurate comfortable and looks sharp	19
0	one lvel up from the es30vs much more capable of the last generation the es35vs is a versatile unit capable of handling all home recording needs and most professional needs as well remote control is easier to use than the last generation the addition of the dvi input gives it ease of recording from camcorders with a clikc of a button i am very happy with this uni	19
0	it was easy to set up and use our remote was bad out of the box but panasonic sent us a replacement we were able to record tv programs right away and then transferred our old vhs over to dvd it took a long time to transfer but it was worth watching the vhs tapes again to bring back memories	19
0	does exactly what it 's supposed to do i live 30 miles from the stations and have a good amount of tress surrounding my house but i still receive all the network channels and their subchannels perfectly easy to install too	19
0	i have this console for protection of master bedroom 40 lcd samsung 1080p hdtv and denon surrond sound 7 1 home theater system i have been very pleased with the improved picture and sound before hooking up to this console i had a slight wave going across the screen it is now gone as is the slight buzz from the sound system i also have 1 2 power outages every month from new construction in our area the console has protected all of the equipment very well considering the price and free shipping through amazon i highly recommend this console	19
0	it 's a good quality notebook bag that can fit 17 laptops notebooks easily balances well on your shoulder \( unlike some bags that rest lopsided \) good strong stitch it can get heavy but then again you 're carrying around a 17 laptop	19
0	i needed extra space for pictures and musis downloads this was just right not too expensive and large enought to fit the purpose	19
0	this antenna is one of the best indoor uhf antennas but is designed for uhf only many cities use both uhf vhf for digital tv to see if uhf vhf are used in your area enter your address at www antennaweb orgthen look at the digtal channel frequency assignments column if any channels are 2 thru 13 this antenna is not for you do not buy any knockoff antennas sold by terk they are mostly junk	19

0	a fast card which works as expected you do n't know the difference a fast card can make unless you swap to a slower one even a slower camera device will have improved performance with a faster card such as this one enjoy	19
0	this memory card has not given us any trouble very reliable product highly recommend	19
0	plenty of room for our hpa612 printer and a friend bought the same one for her hpa617 pockets for extra paper shoulder strap for even more ease in transporting the printer	19
0	when the room temperature hot and no one else wants the air conditioner turned on this desktop air conditioner cools just my 7 feet by 7 feet personal space it 's heaven i would n't be without this is my second order	19
0	i really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use ! ! it clips nicely onto my laptop or i can take it off it comes with a little protective case and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you 're not using i really like it and all its features as well	19
0	i bought these after buying tdk for the past 5 years and now only being able to get memorex at a low price \( i 've had very bad experiences with memorex cdrs in the past \) these were surprisingly cheap as verbatim is one of the highest quality blank media brands not surprisingly the discs lived up to expectations on my plextor 716a drive i have n't tested a whole lot yet but the ones i did test burn flawlessly and when disc scans were run there were no errors you really ca n't go wrong with verbatim just buy them	19
0	i exchange audio letters with friends and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony 100 dvs died and no replacement parts were available the sound quality is perfectly fine though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high end machine it comes with a stereo microphone but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit as it is there is a long clip on cord this makes it tough to do off the cuff recording overall a good value for the money the other machine cost nearly 300	19
0	i bought this so i can transfer video from my panasonic pv gs300 camcorder to my pc installation was easy and my computer was up and running in a matter of minutes the is a great value considering they include a 6 pin to 4 pin firewire cable too i highly recommend this product	19
0	i purchased this for my wife who wanted a case for herhp pavilion notebook pc \( dv5139us \) screen size 15 4 ht 1 8 wdth 14 1 depth 10 4 the bag is for personal use not business and use will be moderate she did want some extra compartments for organization this case has met all her needs it is light weight constructed of durable material well organized her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease she is satisfied with this purchase we would recommend purchasing this case	19
0	a great product snug fit on the laptop and appears to be a part of the laptop itself difficult to remove but no real reason to remove it anyway	19
0	i can verify again that this is indeed 16 gauge wire this size works very well for small medium satellite speakers i am using this wire with a samsung ht q80 htib it 's working wonderfully and i'm getting nice crisp sound unlike the other reviewer my spool came fully intact i would suggest this for anybody looking for good cheaply priced 16 gauge speaker wire	19
0	if you zoom in on the picture you 'll notice that it 's actually 16 gauge wire i received it and can confirm that it 's 16 gauge wire works fine although the spool that 's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing it 's not a big deal though and my only disappointment was on my end when i realized 100' was n't enough to hook up my 7 speakers	19
0	this is a great little machine and has so many uses i bought 2 of them and 2 days later came back to amazon to buy some more for gifts and the price has doubled what 's with that \? keep looking and you 'll find this at a hot price again eventually	19
0	never having had any other headphones i do n't really know how to compare these but the speakers definetely work fine and i can identify different directions' sounds but there is a small crackling in the background that wo n't go away and i ca n't find out why	19
0	as headphones they work fine but the microphone falls off repeatedly and this appears to be the result of a bad design after the 10th time the microphone failed entirely and refuses to work i 've isolated the problem to the microphone itself as headphones they are fine but in you need a microphone you should look elsewhere	19
0	i received them ok none broken or cracked this price beats walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases i have ever used i like the translucent back better than the black ones at staples	19
0	this is great it makes it easier for us all to listen to the music in the car	19
0	bueno esta quemadora dvd muy buena recomendable para los usuarios que quieran vivir una experiencia unica es la mejor que ha existido gracias amazon por vender productos de vanguardi	19
0	before adding this antenna to my wireless router i had unreliable connections since adding it i consistently get the high speed connection i'm paying for	19
0	i was a little worried about spending almost 70 on this bag but when i recieved it i was so impressed i really love this bag ! very well made ! ! the crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows but i really like it to be honest i shy away from croc patterns but it really works with this bag ! i have a 15 4 in gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag	19
0	this bag is just pefect ! i purchased it for my dell inspiron 6400 and although the fit was pretty snug i am very pleased with the purchase it is easy to carry and above everything else is very stylish and professional	19
0	excellent service but i expected to see another model of the handbag it looked different on the picture	19
0	a great addition to the ih5 radio ! you could do without it but being able to adjust volume from across my apartment is a great feature	19
0	i travel overseas a lot for my job this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your normal plugs for operating four devices most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money \( wires cables etc \) but this gizmo rocks	19
0	we 've only had ours a week and i wish we 'd bought it sooner the photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones i like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big hp printer 's photos which stay sticky for some time having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters to use in scrapbooking and to frame for your home or for gifts really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop	19
0	like the name suggests the m audio audiophile 2496 is for true audiophiles i have had this card for years and there still is few options that are on par with this card for the same money the audiophile has a full dynamic range of crisp audio with little distortion i connect my sound card via digital coaxial cable to my harman kardon avr 240 and the sound is amazingly clear the one drawback to this card is it may be difficult for some to learn to use at first however when quality is essential go with the audiophile 2496	19
0	the only reason i did n't give this item 5 stars is because i have only taken it on the road once so as of yet i ca n't call it a worthy 'road warrior ' however it is certainly a great case proportioned well and good design with space for essentials would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17 widescreen notebook	19
0	i bought this for my husbands birthday he was very excited he had been looking at bags at a local store and had n't found anything as nice as this especially for the price plenty of room for his laptop and pens notebooks extra books etc very durable highly recommend	19
0	i love the jlab miniblaster because no matter where i go i can have my favorite music with me the sound is clear and i found this product easy to use i will be giving several of these for holiday gifts and birthday presents to friends and relatives young and old the delivery was prompt and i appreciated the friendly customer service in response to my questions	19
0	the cable set that comes in this item is what ought to have been included in the airport express this comes with a 2 meter rca ministereo a 2 meter optical ministereo and a 6ft power cable i found that both the rca and optical cables worked flawlessly with my receiver i wish that the power cable was a little longer and i would 've liked to have received a white ethernet cable to complete this set the installation of any of these cable went very easily with the on caveat that you must ensure to remove the covers on the optical cable which may not be obvious to some	19
0	it is a good universal remote control i had several but this is the only one that could realy controles my tv wel	19
0	theis is a small manuverable mouse i especially like it for playing games since it is very quick i had one before and i would buy another if this one quits	19
0	i lost my original stylus \( left it at a restaurant \) this replacement pack of styli are just like my original i have none of the problems the other reviewer had my stylus fits perfectly and the telescoping top is just like my original this is a great replacement	19
0	this carry case is great it would be even greater if it had a carry strap	19
0	oem charger failed replaced with this one it 's more compact functions well	19
0	this product works great for my ibook g4 screen and also for cleaning off most smudges on the case although it seems like i'm constantly getting new smudges on the screen do n't expect it to get off the spots that build up on keyboard over time though mr clean magic eraser works well for that but only if you make sure to thoroughly squeeze the water out before use on your computer otherwise it may get in and ruin your keyboard	19
0	i have both the 4 port and 2 port versions of these and they seem to work well with my dell optiplex 260 running windows xp my poweredge 500sc 1400 and 1800 tend to lose the mouse and keyboard and have to be rebooted but this may be a function of running windows 2003 r2 on them also the 1800 has a promise sata card which locks up with usb in general making this switch a problem \( i had to go back to the ps2 kvm \) but with xp machines it seems fine	19
0	the connectpro usb kvm switch costs a few dollars more but it really works the first time with no hassles i 've been forced to use cheaper kvm switches at work and windows xp never seems to play nice with them i use this one at home with two linux machines and a desktop and laptop running windows xp the switch worked the first time i connected everything together and has worked glitch free ever since	19
0	works just as expected switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop \( all running winxp \) each machine takes lt 1 min to recognize same as when plugging in any new usb device very durable cables was concerned about using wireless keyboard mouse but works great with the microsoft wireless desktop including the multimedia function keys version of the switch that i received is black not white as pictured	19
0	speakers give good sound quality and are small and unnoticeable at a good price all the things i was looking for in speake	19
0	i bought this switch last week the installation was as easy as plug n play no major problems so far this switch is worth its price	19
0	i have bought this for about 8pp in my office for their black and white desktop printer so far not one problem the toner is long lasting and affordable great quality small desktop footprint does a great job with envelopes labels and even light cardstock i would highly reccommend to anyone	19
0	my husband and father both have this unit it 's really handy to have on road trips and to use while geocaching from our experience it does take a while to download map information onto the unit and a color screen would be nice but for 200 i think it 's a good value	19
0	actually i loved the philips acoustic edge an earlier and internal sound card but it did not like my older dual processor system because of that i was a bit skittish about using their current internal card with a processor that uses hyper threading which windows treats as dual processors i bought the aurelium instead i love this thing ! i am a bit of an audiophile and this sound card is just perfect with my klipsch computer speakers it makes a perfect combination	19
0	a nice little radio good sound for the price i like the easy to read station indicator	19
0	i love this item we bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation it can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van the boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it i was glad about that i 'd recommend this item	19
0	the case was very well made and sturdy unfortunatly it was too small for my sony 7 in dvd portable player returning it to amazon was quick and easy i wish it would have fit	19
0	this is a great product for your mini the armband is well constructed from a neoprene type material \( which does n't slip when you 're sweaty \) with heavy duty velcro all the way around and the ipod holder is securly screwed onto it the rubberized skin keeps your ipod safe from sweat and provides some shock and scratch resistance this is n't a super cheap armband but as they say you \( usually \) get what you pay for this should last you for years of gymming running biking	19
0	very good product actually came with a bonus 8 cd sleeve to attach to a car visor for free very happy with the produc	19
0	it can transfer flash drive sd card to a car mp3 player that 's very nice i love it	19
0	wonderful holds all my songs holds my books on tape so i can listen on the road photos are large and sharp very easy to use and easy to download the dials are excelent on off and volume work flawlessly i have many products such as car adapter speakers external charger and external microphone and all work great i highly recommend the unit i would never get less then 60 gigs plenty of space for all of my needs on my recent trip to california this was the only thing i took for entertainment never listened to a song twice	19
0	this is my second one of this model i burned up the first myself when we moved and i accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it \( too much voltage smoke \) i found it easy to configure set up wep keys mac locked everything using the web based interface it worked great with our linksys media extender we watch recorded tv from our media center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device no problems whatsoever has n't slowed down my internet connection either i am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work	19
0	i 've been in the newspaper business for many years and i 've always used recorders at governmental meetings interviews etc much easier and faster than taking notes and it allows me to focus more on my subject until now i 've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event this little sony is the perfect size picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear additionally it has a long battery life and i never run out of room while i'm taping i could n't ask for more	19
0	out of the box and into the attic followed the instructions and i'm receiving perfect signals for my 46 sony hdtv set from pensacola fl \( approx 20 miles \) and mobile al \( approx 50 miles \) i did read the instructions and followed them i believe the folks that are n't happy with this model did n't read and follow the instructions	19
0	unlike most tech gadgets that are a little outdated this product stands in nearly every aspect the sleek supreme design by f a porsche makes this product appearance timeless and its preformance is outstanding more effective in this model than its smaller slower \( 80gb 120 gb \) counterparts the autostart is a little slow for me \( its the usb model not firewire remeber \) but is a totally acceptable feature for the price design performance cost benefit equilibrium excellent purchase	19
0	he estado disfrutando de este tv por alredeor de 5 dias la imagen es muy buena facil de instalar lo unico que se deberia mejorar es el sonido	19
0	monster has always had the reputation to being the best in quality for their products when you think of wires you cannot help think of monster cable i used this cable to connect my carputer to my factory head unit ran up the middle of the car grouped with a vga cable and multiple usb cables there is no feedback at all i was worried the vga feed may leak into this cable but monster did not let me down i highly recommend this product but as others on here have stated little pricey in the end 'you get what you pay for !	19
0	i 've had a ge and a sony \( cd543rm \) kitchen under counter units i 've also tested a few others in stores the sony 543 model is superior to any other unit out their and the sony 553 is superior to the sony 543 the 553 is worth the extra bucks for the better sound quality and am fm reception	19

0	all of the pc to stereo cbales i could find in the stores were only 6ft long due to the furniture arrangement in my living room i needed a longer cable to make the connection i was also worried about loss of sound quality over long distances the 20 ft monster cable took care of both those issues for me the connections are solid and the sound quality is great it was well worth the money	19
0	i bought this mouse about three months ago and i love it it works on every surface and the scroller works well too the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short \( about 2 5 feet long \) and it plugs into the left hand side of my laptop which means that i only have about a foot to work with although i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left \( good deal for the left handed population i guess \) some people have complained about the wind up function for the cord getting tangled but i have n't had any problems with that	19
0	these phones are great sound quality is very good including the speaker phone option phones have many handy features and all features are intuitive to use no problem with the range very easy to set up battery life has proven to be no concern so far the phones feel comfortable in the hand i could n't be happier	19

0	when i first got a wireless network at home i purchased a kensington wifi finder it worked fine but as time went on i saw these smaller versions come out from chrysalis development i heard they were more powerful and more versatile so i bought one i was not disappointed since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car it fit perfectly on my keychain also it has a much longer range than the others but best of all it is directional meaning i can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the leds change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases what a great product i love it !	19
0	this product work perfectly in the epson printer ! the quality of printing is great !	19

0	i have a 40 samsung lcd and wanted an arm that would both extend and also be able to hold 50 lbs or so this arm feels solid and does the job the tv has n't fallen yet one thing to be sure of is to check the size adapter plate you will need to connect the arm to your tv my arm came with a 200 x 100 but i needed a 200 x 200 plate and had to order it separately i would recommend this arm	19
0	i bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17 laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is the storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag i also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to as an engineer i must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop	19

0	when it comes to ink for my r1800 photo printer i am concerned with the quality of the images i print the epson matte black ultrachrome hi gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water fading and smudging it is important to me that my prints are of high quality so i do n't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges the color can be duplicated but all inks are not created equal third party options may produce a good print initially but may not hold up or last as long pros provides superior resistance to water fading and smudgingcons pric	19

0	while these recorders are considered old fashioned by electronic geeks they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape he still insisted he could n't remember anything but had to admit it was his voice and that he being the model of honesty and truth must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke very effective these old fashioned recorders	19
0	after 8 months of thinking these \( foam inserts that came with my e3c 's \) will last forever i broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty whoa ! the new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened my great sound and comfort was back and the decay was so gradual i did n't even realize what i was missing ! so 5 stars for performance but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs avg 4stars	19
0	i needed to have an s video feed from my classroom computer to a projector and to a tv monitor this proved to be the most cost effective solution to the problem it works just as hoped	19
0	this cable was just what i needed to connect my stereo to my computer 's sound card across the room i 've been converting old lps to digital files and having a well built cable probably improved the sound quality considerably amazon 's price was unbeatable too	19
0	opened the enclosure plugged in my hard drive connected it to my pc and it worked simple as that i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws but that was the only \( very minor \) problem there is no fan in the case which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself i am pleased with the enclosure and would happily recomend it to anyone	19
0	we bought this to use with our ws 300m to record a class we thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording in the end we set the recorder to mono \( hq \) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other ! good quality but distracting save your money and buy the mono mic the quality is excellent in either setting buy the way in case you miss it this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder	19
0	i received my package within three days via the super saver shipping \( cost me nothing \) the printer is great too i used the brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to hp and i'm impressed the printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up and its very light weight and small size making it more portable i love it	19
0	bought this mp3 player for my girlfriend for christmas she loves it it is small and easy to use the headphones could be better though the process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast considering you cannot hear the music without headphones and the headphones that come with it are not very good it only gets a 4 out of 5	19
0	i recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but i was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg it was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers she seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents the only real problem that i had with is that it costed less a few days after i purchased it but that 's really a personal problem	19
0	i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product other than offering more color combinations would be to make it bulletproof which it damn near is already a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory although 15 might come across as steep for such a small product the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds the 100 shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it 's category	19
0	the card works great in my camera no problems i would recommend the product	19

0	since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone \( esp with caller id \) this phone is tops this phone and all other at t phones corded or cordless exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up but no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable given the other choices this is the one to get	19
0	i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case what i received is what i expected lots of compartments to store needed accessories sturdy construction pleasant appearance as with a previous review my only citicism is the shoulder strap while it is comfortable when used it is also fixed and cannot be removed i 've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane other than that it was a good purchase for the price	19
0	if only other computer products were this easy to set up and use highly recommend this product	19
0	makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands only thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier	19

0	i bought the cooler for my dell inspiron which tends to get hot because i work it so hard it 's cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically is very sturdy yet light enough for me so i bought another \( wide screen \) \( black \) version for my hp pavilion which has more ram and so does n't have to work that hard now its internal fan virtually never kicks in in both cases the fan is so quiet that i have to turn it on off to make sure that it is working the only improvement i would suggest is more usb ports 4 stars because 5 is perfection	19

0	this pny 2 0gb card has proven to be plenty as a digital camera card we purchased the 2 gig card for my wife 's canon powershot s 900 elph to replace smaller memory cards although 1gb cards worked adequately with the elph we noticed early on that its 10 0 mega pixels quickly filled up the photo card the 2 0gb holds many more photos \( over 400 shots and counting \) than the 1gb at half the price of other brands the pny is proving to be very satisfactory \( we purchased two 2 0s at once \) we happily recommend the pny 2 0gb photo card for your photos it makes a great gift candidate get yours soon !	19

0	the printer is fast and printing is always properly aligned on the paper quality of printed text is as good as any decent desktop printer and that is why i bought it in the first place i am yet to try printing photos because this is a mobile printer the manufacturer needs to ensure that the unit will stand up to the hits and accidents caused by regular transporting it might mean providing a second skin or a padded bag with the uni	19

0	i originally bought this cd case for my car because i listen to cds the most while driving this was not a good case to bring back and forth at all it is very large and heavy \( even without cds ! \) and the long zipper tail makes it hard to open with one hand i now use it to house computer software and playstation gamecube games for what you pay it is an excellent buy	19

0	it works fine but it gets really annoying when you 're using it with a widescreen mac and a widescreen tv the zoom function most plasmas and lcd tvs have is 16 9 aspect ratio whereas macs are at 16 10 aspect ratio so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you 're trying to display or have massive letter boxing after three months i still have n't had any glitches that were this adapter 's fault if you have hdmi or dvi on your tv or projector do n't bother with this go straight to dvi with a mini dvi to dvi adapter then get a dvi to dvi cord or a dvi to hdmi cord	19

0	for the price these speakers are well worth the cost of course in my opinion anything that dosnt say creative on it is usually worth the price not a lot of bass but with the bass boost these speakers sound real nice only bad thing i 'll say is that m audio 's tech department is really bad emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista still no answer \( my inquiry was about a different m audio product \)	19
0	note this product will only work on walls with wood studs no metal studs see the sanus website for installation manual and more details	19
0	the carry case does the job of holding my walkman and therefore i say it is worth the money however i have found for my smaller arm it is hard to get it wrapped around in a steady position but with some effort it does overall i am happy with the purchase	19

0	i ca n't say enough about the tivoli am fm radio ! it has superior sound and i love the design of the case as well some folks might be hesistant to spend over 100 for a radio trust me it is well worth it my girlfriend 's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years still sounds great	19
0	simple but does what it 's supposed to allows you to connect the audio output of a laptop pc ipod etc to the audio input on your tv	19
0	this product has worked great with my 2wire gateway modem from at t yahoo the real plus has been the usb connection so its not necessary to take off the desktop 's back panel the connection has been good and i set it up in minutes i tend to think that people who are having connection problems have a problem with their router and not this device i can see 50 networks from all over my neighborhood	19
0	this printer does an excellent job the colors are vivid and the clarity isvery crisp the only negative is you are restricted to the canon paper with end tabs good value for a compact snap shot printer	19
0	switch was simple to install to my existing network just plug and go i used this switch to separate some cpus off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway worked just as planned and was seamless i actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch network speed and response time increased even for those cpus w out a gig nic i like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic highly recommend	19

0	i'm so happy with these speakers for the price the sound is utterly amazing i have a good moderately priced system and these speakers really make it special no one can believe the crystal highs or the big bass coming from such humble looking speakers	19
0	this radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple user friendly set of controls also perfect for those that like analogue style controls that would be encountered on older radios i have the s 350 the model that the s 350dl replaces for general world band programme listening this radio is fantastic outstanding speaker easy to read digital display includes backlight includes attenuator clock can be set to 24 hour time easy to carry anywhere robust antenna does not support ssb tuning which you would need to tune in ham radio same radio sold under tescun name in other parts of the world	19

0	i needed this cable to use with my garmin rino 120 because my new laptop did n't have a serial adapter my first try was to use a similiar product from radio shack but i found the radio shack product was very confusing to use and was unstable i ordered the cp technologie product from amazon and it worked great ! also the cp tech product was less than half the cost of the radio shack product \( including shipping \)	19
0	i tried many other adapters and this was the only one that worked for my pda	19
0	this wall mount works and hold 's great i used it for an olevia 542i lcd flat panel and have had no problems the instructions are not all that clear but it is not hard to figure out how to instal	19

0	great new product ! easy to use and turns my audio ipod into a portable media player i can even use it to record my favorite tv shows i highly recommend this product	19
0	for this price these are a steal ! purchased mine for 15 \( with shipping \) and let me tell you it was worth it ! the headphones come with a 1 4 converter too ! so you can use them for cd players and amps ! the sound quality is good and the headphones do n't hurt half as much as other ones after wearing for several hours these are an amazing deal for the price i'm honestly surprised these ar n't marked for 50 do n't pass these up if your looking for decent quality headphones	19
0	when i opened my package i was a little disappoined with this product but after using it for a while i learned to like it it is easy to use the front controls with the inno but akward to turn on and off overall a nice case shoped around and found amazon had best price with free shipping received in about one week	19
0	i bought these for some sony surround sound speakers although i was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is \( essentially \) plastic however they turned out to be very sturdy and easy to install i also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware well worth the price	19
0	popped it in works like a charm hardest part is opening the packaging but other than that no worries	19
0	my husband and i bought this for our new home and we 're both thrilled ! he loves that it holds our new tv and stereo system and i love the way it looks it 's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours we 're so glad we found something we could both agree on ! what a great piece of furniture !	19
0	they are good for the price they have a very good sound quality or at least better than the ones that came with my sony walkman dej001 the only problem i had is when i connected them to my older philips player it had a low volume output and then again even on the sony player i had to have the volume at 7 and it only goes to 9 if you have a high output player or a computer these will be great but if your using them for a low output or old device these probably wo n't cut the cheese	19
0	easy to mount on the wall though this item came with hardware with different sizes i still had to buy some hardware with different length than what they supplied this mount perfectly suited for my 46 sony lcd flat panel in about 30 min i could mount tv on this bracket	19
0	seems to be good quality has a strong rubber scent and no cutouts for the 4 small buttons though	19
0	i have two ipods that do n't work i bought a shuffle first and that has an error that i ca n't fix and apple ca n't fix so i thought i 'd buy 1gb ipod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer so this time i made the right decision and bought the 30 gb zune wow ! the zune is so much better ! it has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely instead of making you frustrated like the ipod the screen is perfect sound quality is excellent 5 stars for the zune	19
0	i do n't bother charging my zune from the computer any more this is the only way to go	19
0	this compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio all computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down it was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers i will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first	19
0	garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to this option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the gps now if only the software was smart about how and when to use the sensor	19
0	i used this recorder alot i have alot of classes and the playback is good it has little folders where if you recorded on one section rather than worrying that you have n't listened yet you can move to the next folder and record the sound quality is good 36h record time which can be broken up to folders the only thing when you are recording make sure tht you adjust the volume i forgot to turn the volume alittle higher and the recording was low and that goes vice versa as well nice little easy to maneuver recorder without having to be overwhelmed with the buttons	19
0	this is about the only mouse i buy have gone through a couple of them in the past few years i just ca n't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out this model is one that i find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using if you want a good reliable comfortable mouse this logitech is a good choice	19
0	this is a great product for those who probably do n't write too much as an engineering student i found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable however it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class plus it would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally	19
0	this is truly the best wifi you can get on the market right now its lightning fast its 4 machines put into 1 most importantly i 've had the best gaming experience ever now i can host games on xbox live without lagging the rest of my teammates and that is no fun the linksys wrt330n wireless n gigabit gaming router is well worth its money and a great investment i recommend it highly to anyone that needs a great wifi for whatever reason	19
0	i already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers the speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled the mounts are solid and can be oriented in any direction easily i am about to by three more for my center and two fronts i highly recommend	19
0	i have an explorist 210 and this bracket fits it like a glove good sturdy bracket uni directional with strong suction cups installed over a month ago and still has not come loose from windshield great product for the money \( in my case 30 76 free shipping \) purchased a second one for my other vehicle	19
0	this product is really what i expected it to be it has a very clear display with a high resolution for a 4 inch screen the stereo sound is really good and it has a long lasting battery buttons are easy to use i tried recording from the television and it is also satisfying i had no problem about any divx or xvid video type i really enjoy watching films with cowon a2	19
0	i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing ! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players i love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my tv and watch on a big screen any place i go	19
0	i 've used allot of different adapters but this one is got to be the best ever the linksys wpc54gx4 work with all routers but when you pair it up with the linksys wrt54gx4 router look out my range increased and i'm getting upwards of 250mb of speed setup is also a breeze	19
0	i bought it in feb 2006 never had any problem occasionally it stops working and just restarting both the units \( sender and receiver \) fixes the problem i am so satisfied i am buying another pair	19
0	this has got to be the easiest piece of tech i have ever set up except for charging it took under 5 minutes it works as advertised i use skypein and skypeout my phone bill is now 68 a year instead of 384 i also get voice mail for free with the skypein call quality seems as good as ma bell i was concerned with it being made by netgear as i have had spotty luck with their products i liked this phone so much i just purchase another handset \( it can support up to 4 \) this phone will pay for itself in a few months	19
0	im not a professional keyboard player i bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and guitar pro it suits those needs great its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing the keyboard itself is extremly small reminds me of a kids toy keyboard if your looking for something more professional you will probably have to fork out the 100 bucks and get the bigger model	19
0	this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference but to see the beam \( not just the dot at the end of the beam \) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out and if you are wondering no matter how bright your laser is without particles in the air you wont see the beam at concerts where they use the big argon lasers they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of	19
0	this has a nice size screen it only has 3 buttons play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it i was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button i just found this out by trial there was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital this would only last a second or two at first i thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them the volume control is on the side as well as the power button it could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me	19
0	very good product small easy to store well worth the very reasonable price	19
0	great invention to those who do n't want to be attached to an ipod and like an updated version of a juke box easy to use load unfortunately however it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound	19
0	i'm not any expert in the computer world but this product it is very easy to install the range is very strong i'm very hapy with this product ! ! !	19
0	i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises but it works nonetheless and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections but i suspect it 's related to where i have things in the house no so much the product in fact i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine it 's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed ca n't complain especially for the price	19
0	i bought a zen 30g mp3 player and could not stand the earbuds they came with they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v moda earbuds came in they are awesome the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon so i feel pretty good about the purchase	19
0	this is a great card for a laptop however they need to correct their problems with the installer for xp also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line once you do get to them they fix the problem right away seems they know it will not install correctly then it works great	19
0	the product description is incorrect usb 2 0 works fine on the newer macs that have such ports it 's overpriced buy a gently used one	19
0	i use this bag to carry my hp nc6000 business notebook i have received many complements on this bag	19
0	i am using this bag for school in which i need to carry 4 textbooks a laptop \( 15 4 inch screen \) and a couple of notebooks the pack has plenty of room for these items and still a couple of empty front pockets for additional gear with all that weight the pack is still comfortable to wear and has yet to bother my back	19
0	these dvds are probably the highest quality and most reliable that i have tried and given their low price what is there not to like \? i would recommend these to just about anyone	19
0	in comparison to the component cables the quality is a little better i do n't think i agree with those who say you must have hdmi cables to get a good picture but i am extremely satisfied with the product and i do n't regret purchasing it amazon 's price for this product is unmatched	19
0	totally agree with the other reviewers' comments originally i was going to buy canon 's adapter for my powershot a640 not realizing it was plastic ! ! plus even with shipping this is still cheaper \( by 5 bucks \) and its metal ! fyi if you do n't have any filters \( like i did n't \) get tiffens 3 filter set 52mm \( circular polarizer uv protector and 812 warming len \) a good buy for the price i bought it because of the reviewers' comments and do n't regret it	19
0	it costs 30 40 less than the canon la dc58f conversion lens adapter and it 's metal not plastic need to say more	19
0	i purchased 4 of these adapters \( 3 extra \) so i could hook up my macbook 's digital output for digital surround sound through my logitech speakers the product works exactly as i expected great digital sound from my macbook parts express did an excellent job of getting my order to me sooner than i expected \( ordered on a saturday and they had the package to the courier by saturday night \) very prompt service i would definitely order from them again overall a great product from a prompt company !	19
0	excellant product excellant price hope to do business again ty for fast speedy shipment a pleasure doing business with you	19
0	this really works i have 3 zp100 's and 1 zp80 using a nas for storage of my mp3 's the whole thing hangs together perfectly if you want to get music through your whole house this is a great way to do it most importantly tech support is great ! ! !	19
0	wow ! i did n't trust the other review i needed a mini amp so i decided to bought this one because of the price and of the dual purpose right out of the box it actually smell bacon ! ! amazing it was true ! and not only that if someone is trying to kick you out of your house because of the noise of your beloved amp and do n't want to stop this is the mini amp for you ca n't believe the speaker in it and about the disto well is ok for practice wo n't regret about it	19
0	i have had this items before in fact this is a replacement for one that was mounted on my motor home the windshield had to be replaced and a new antenna was needed works fine just like the one before a very eash purchase and fast delivery	19
0	i 've been using this nas for a month and it 's great ! the box is quite speedy with a maxtor ata 133 drive with a 16mb cache i have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files very slick ! i ca n't get the built in ftp server to work through my firewall but i think that 's a ports issue all in all a great box	19
0	i wanted to be able to shoot lots over several days without dragging a laptop with me through multiple airports i bought two and both worked fine right out of the box not the fastest card ever but certainly large storage for the price	19
0	when i bought these i was mainly looking for a long enough cord to be able to put my mp3 player in my pocket not only is the cord legnth great but so is the sound i did n't expect the sound quality to be so good in such an inexpensive product the cord also has a built in volume control so i do n't have to dig the player out of my pocket to adjust the volume the buds are quite comfortable i have worn them for hours at a time with no problem i love these	19
0	i just purchased a mogo mouse and i'm amazed at how usable it is i was extremely skeptical \( and probably would n't have bought one \) until i was able to try a colleague 's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is the one thing and it 's a pretty big thing is the lack of scroll wheel technology that 's a sorely missed feature in this mouse that said there are always trade offs but in this case that 's the only one battery life seems great usability is great convenience is great just add the touch pad and it 'll be the mouse for notebook computer users !	19
0	when you look at the price it may seem pricey but when you get the product there is some serious engineering involved the web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason i bought an ergotron the attention to detail is incredible mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two person job other than that the installation was flawless this is a very solid and well machined kudos to ergotron \( also these guys are serious about ergonomics 10 pages on how to set proper height for various installations \) wonderful product 5 stars shipping from amazon was slow and behind schedule	19
0	i am an it director and bought these for exercisers for my users the outside is like a balloon only much stronger rubber and the inside is gel when you squeeze them the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color it 's cool ! the resistance is very good and my users love them ! good product great value and excellent quality	19
0	when you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate it really seems to run out of one color much quicker than the others personally its usually red it has caught me with my pants down a couple times going to print out a project the night before its due only to run out of red or blue ink i would definetly suggest to always have an extra one around just in case	19
0	i use only the best products not refills or other manufactures as i have had problems with print cartridges that have ruined my printers the hp ink jet cartridges are the best i will always buy them	19
0	this is a great case i have had no problems with it and works very well it 's also very sexy if you want to put it that way and looks really cool only trouble i have is that when i open it sometimes it 'll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch but its very minor and does no damage it 's a great item ! however if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot i 'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc just protect it from scratches and smudges i recommend it highly	19
0	this card works exactly as stated by startech i bought two one for a pc and one for a mac popped 'em in and plugged in ipods external hardrives a scanner and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly the pc needed a quick setup and the mac worked instantly ! and all at a great price ! ca n't figger out why you guys are having trouble	19
0	bought this player for its size \( sports \) and its napster compatibility updated the firmware after having a rocky start but things seem a little more stable now also seemed to shut off in cold weather when outside for long periods \( around 0 degrees celsius \) odd behaviour but mostly ok now that we are in the spring teens again have n't found a case yet to protect from sweat interface is what i expected dead simple no complaints for the price	19
0	excellent machine great performancesaved lot of time and desk space great scanning speed and qualit	19
0	i have had other apc battery backup 's in the past and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit given our power failures brown out and the high wind and storms in our area the apc does an excellent job i have not only my desktop pc but my scanner printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures	19
0	there are over 100 reviews i am not saying the same thing again i just throw my rating in all i can say is you will be better off if you completely learn how to master this calculator	19
0	i have been using this mouse at work since it came out after many miles of use the scroll wheel has finally started to fail i can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls the best feature of this mouse is the battery life a coworker who swears by his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months but i usually got at least ten months out of mine i even took to dating the batteries when i installed them just to rub it in this mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some but overall i would recommend it going to try a rechargable logitech next time around	19
0	i do n't know where the guy below got that this card does n't work with windows media center edition because i just installed the latest xp drivers for the card on media center edition 2005 and it works perfectly i sold my gigaport ag to get this because of the much better signal noise ratio that the firewire audiophile has and it made a big difference very clean sound ! i use it to dj with using mixvibes using the asio drivers and it works beautifully ! a great buy to say the least pick one up you wont regret it	19
0	we purchased this tv in dec of 2006 we are very happy with it it was very easy to plug and play had it ready in no time for holiday i would definitely recommed it to new buyers	19

0	right price and works off of usb ! the sound is terrible on macbook so this will fill in nicely	19
0	i bought this cute little speaker from walmart \( 14 \) and it is so compact and very useful it also matches with my other speakers of sony dream system this has 4 usb ports \( so good when they stay on your desktop rather than on your pc sitiing down the table \) they are lighted so that you can plug them in even night speaker is good quality and it has one usb connection and one dc connection quality of sound is good if not excellent overall it is a great buy for the price	19
0	works as advertised i needed longer range and it provided easy setup stable connection	19

0	i just purchased the archos 604 about 3weeks ago so far so good it interfaces very easily with the computer though i have not tried it using windows media 10 yet i recommend at least buying the archos docking adapter kit \( if you do not plan on using the archos to record programs \) it allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos the only negative that i have so far is that the volume at its highlest level is difficult to hear on an airplane you may need some noise canceling headphones	19
0	i ordered this for my teenage daughter for christmas and she loves it the sound is great and the amplifier works well for the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument i recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar	19

0	the price i paid for this spindle of cd r 's was pretty good and have not had a problem yet the only price that i have seen that beats this one was staples running a sale of 50 for 10 but i have yet to use the stock that i bought as i still have about 25 left on the spindle if you do n't want to wait for their sale this is an excellent bargain the print surface has done very well with the inks from my epson photo r 220	19
0	the case is nice but i bought it thinking it would hold my folding keyboard it was too small the price was great and the transaction was flawless	19
0	compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special cf 's with extended bases other than that it ca n't be beat for the price and quality adorama rocks	19
0	i enjoyed putting this together the spacers kinda threw me until i realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf i got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the dvd shelves were n't spaced properly cd sized so i had to take it apart and redo it but that was n't too bad the spacers snap apart easily enough even for my feeble fingers it 's not terribly sturdy maybe i did n't get the poles screwed down tightly enough but as long as it 's in its permanent location holds the multimedia well i really like the way it looks bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one too	19
0	the amd ahtlon 64 venice processor is great installed into my new gigabyte mb without a hitch and runs very cool that will give up some room for future overclocking overall i would highly recommend the processor by applying for their credit card i received a really low price from amazon which was very surprising about 170 00 with free shipping and no tax everyone else was 200 230 for the same processor it is a great cpu at a good price from amazon	19

0	this 23 lcd hdtv has excellent image quality and looks really stylish too it also comes with hdmi so you can hook up the latest hd video source such as hd dvd or blue ray hi def dvd players the lcd panel itself displays vivid evenly lit images and ghosting appears to not be a problem on this model i personally ended up opting for the sharp ld 23sh1u hdtv lcd monitor because the sharp works as pc mac monitor \( plus j r started offering a rebate \) but i think this panasonic is a great choice too no doubt about that	19

0	everything about the sonos worked as advertised it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated the interface is commonsense and well thought out it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously you can also play different music all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises	19
0	the xmb 10 is a great way to listen to my xm audiovox receiver at home the boombox is slightly larger than i desired but the sound is great it 's easy to use lightweight very portable and nice looking	19
0	i got this for my wife to use in the kitchen and she loves it the unit is beautifully designed fun to use and has amazing sound for something so small my only gripe is that the tuner is not very strong i live in a tough area for reception and there 's slight static on my favorite stations the fm antenna attachment that comes with the unit helps quite a bit but the reception is still not totally clear that being said i'm glad i got it and when my wife 's happy i'm happy	19

0	i 've had hp and lexmark printers in the past this canon outshines both of the other brands it is super easy to install without any troubleshooting works like a charm the prints looks great	19
0	amazing sound comes from these tiny inexpensive headphones the different size buds are very comfortable and help produce the deep bass sound once you find the pair the fit your ear when i first got them i put the smallest buds on first and thought i had just bought the worst headphones so i tried the largest buds and found they fit very comfortably and because of the seal they created in my ears they acted as an air tight bass box improving the sound ten fold and just let you know i ussualy cant wear earbud headphones because they hurt my ear holes or they just do n't fit righ	19
0	i reserved the 5th star rating for this unit as i have n't authored or copied very many dvds with it yet however what i have accomplished with it is commendable i can copy an entire commercial dvd \( movie all the extras \) under 50 minutes i have composed a slide show dvd with my own mp3 background music selections and am quite pleased with it so far no coasters i am now in the process of producing dvds of my old 8mm home movies the converter is giving me more problems than anything still recommend the px 755uf for anyone interested in an external burner installation was a snap \( plug n play \)	19
0	these fit over everything very well and they stayed put without stretching out which is why my original pads fell off i guess it 's one of those products that you ca n't do much better than 10 for but maybe they could give you double the number of pads or something	19
0	got this drive a few weeks ago for an apple power mac g4 cube the g4 cube has no fan so drive noise can be very obvious thought the original drive was quiet until this drive was installed this drive puts the original drive to shame with how quiet it is unbelievable do n't even hear the drive spinning up when the machine comes out of sleep disc access is barely audible from a distance of 6 8 inches from the cube and is totally non existent more than 12 inches from the cube will not hesitate to buy seagate barracuda drives for all future machines the 5 year warranty is a winner highly recommend this drive for its silence speed cost and warranty	19

0	i struggled between this and the shure e2c i decided on the e2c after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3 this one has the least clarity but wonderful bass if i do n't listen to as much classical music i 'd definitely pick vmoda vibe it makes even terrible pop songs sound cool i had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason and i had an extremely hard time putting it in even with the help of my bf the vmoda did not come with any foam only the silicon ear pieces i settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c	19
0	this is by far the best radio i 've ever had for singing in the shower no more fumbling and messing with the dial while i 've got soap in my eyes 10 fm presets 5 am presets and 5 tv presets weather i'm always able to find something good to listen to it works great for when i'm out in the yard doing some work as well	19

0	i recently purchased the item and knew that some assembly was required i did n't know that i would be soldering components onto a printed circuit board that 's ok i was an electronic technician in a former life but it might pose a problem to who might purchase this item expecting a snap together kit	19
0	i 've had these earphones for about two month and i 've discovered the following i like the look and they seem to be well made the only grip i have is that they are not very loud	19

0	i purchased the transmitter because i do n't have an aux input in my car the product works well i live in an area that is crowded with stations and the transmitter still provided a strong enough signal to override weak stations and provide near quality audio one review mentioned the sansa player wo n't fit in the transmitter with the silicon case on i use the silicon case to protect my player i took off the belt clip that comes with the case the player and case fits well enough in the transmitter	19
0	i 've used everything from ableton live to protools to reason and this thing is just plug and play very easy interface makes for no brainer recording i'm a guitarist and the stock sound selections are outstanding most players drive themselves crazy tweaking their sound but as you know it 's all about the song the sessions software is a piece of cake and makes it incredibly easy to go with your inspiration instead of getting sidetracked trying to figure out all the bells and whistles fantastic product guys and for the money it 's a steal	19

0	i have purchased over two dozen of these units this is the best unit for the price there are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit this allows you to be certain that your feed is being input also the card slots are a plus two things to be aware of if you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in also if you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required not a one disc does all unit	19
0	works as billed i am currently playing a dvd rl that would not play on any other player i have not purchased a 1080p lcd tv but it is why i purchased an upconverting dvd player i have tried dvd r and dvd rw i will be trying audio formats later i would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the hd versus blueray to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down	19

0	i'm not a serious piano player just casual do n't have room for a piano so this serves my purposes i just want to entertain myself if i were a professional who played in public not sure if this would be the ultimate keyboard because it does n't have a fullsize keyboard but for practicing and casual playing it 's great ! it has more features than i will ever use	19
0	this is exactly what i was looking for not too expensive not much hassle with the cables they are integrated with the unit and no need to reach for the button to switch computers simply press scroll lock twice to go from one computer to the other cables are pretty long which is good longer that i need at the moment but i may appreciate the extra length in the future	19

0	it works very well it 's nice to be able to listen to cd 's in my car without getting a whole new stereo system installed my only problem is that the cd player will turn off every once in a while when the power cord is bent this happens rarely but it 's enough to be a little annoying other than that it 's a very nice product no skipping easy to use and a fair price	19
0	i got this product when i first signed up to telewest broadband and it has never failed i have had it for 2 years and not a problem i started at 512kbps and they 've upgraded me to 4mbps and it handles that speed without a problem perfect for your light moderate or heavy user good all rounder thanks for reading	19
0	this product has good and bad points i listed some below good cheaper than apple \( 5 as compared to 30 \) works greatsmallconvienientbad cheap \( might not hold up long term \) no warranty coverage for your ipod is something goes wronghas to be plugged in upside down \( for me anyway \) overall i'm glad i bought this instead of apple 's version the main factor for me was price but if you have the money get the apple charger simply because you 'll be covered by warranty that way	19
0	just make sure you buy the right drive for your computer and download the software from western digitals website you should have no problems very nice	19
0	i love this remote i was afraid that having a non tivo brand unit \( toshiba brand tivo unit \) would require lots of setup \( testing dozens of codes before finding the right one \) mine worked just as soon as i put batteries into the unit the buttons are quite intuitive i never used the user 's manual yet a real winner an inexpensive replacement for the real unit	19
0	we installed this external hd on a dell computer as most dell customers will attest to any time you talk to one of their representatives they 'll deny compatability with anything other than a dell product well i have upgraded the video card power supply and now added this hd to the computer with very liitle effort this hd has performed perfectly for us	19
0	i bought this because it had got good reviews on here and the price was low enough for it not to pain me ! so far it does what it 's suppose to do i am pleased it 's a little clunky and it looks awful when the anteni are fully extended we 'll see how it works in 6 months	19

0	i am kind of a shortwave junkie and have a few radios all over the place i must admit that for the money spent and the performance and endurance this little bugger is probably my best buy ! i cannot believe the sound quality or the reception its phenominal ! i can pick up shortwave inside the meat packing plant where i work ! \( big heavy steel freezers \) it is a simple small no frills pocket size radio but it blows away anything in its price range trust me	19

0	i travel overseas a lot for my job this little power strip is compact and enables you to keep one adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your normal plugs for operating four devices most monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money \( wires cables etc \) but this gizmo rocks	19
0	i picked this up to use on a mediterranean cruise since the outlets in cruise ship cabins are scarce and usually located right at the edge of a vanity it worked great for charging 2 digital camera batteries which would n't fit in the normal outlet at the same time it 's small rugged and light so it 's easy to pack	19

0	great product that works exactly as described i have not used this as a stand alone label maker i 've only used it with my computer the software is fairly easy to use and it will pull data from an excel spreadsheet which is a definite plus i had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which i needed to make labels and linking to the excel doc made the process very quick and convenient the only complaint i have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey i spent 40 on the label maker and so far i 've spent 60 on tape	19

0	buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again used to have one years ago now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer	19
